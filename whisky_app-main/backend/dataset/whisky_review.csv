2444.0, absolutely delightful whisky just everything in balance with nothing 39 overpowering 39 such a delight  tremendous whiskey though not recommended for rank beginners good solid dram classic lagavulin whilst the sherry influence has been creeping down in recent years she still holds her own always a pleasure to drink  o were my love yon lilac fair wi 39 purple blossoms to the spring and i a bird to shelter there when wearied on my little wing how i wad mourn when it was torn 5 by autumn wild and winter rude but i wad sing on wanton wing when youthfu 39 may its bloom renew 39 d  it is a great single malt and sought after tipple in india we pick it up from duty free shops on our return from overseas  sweet caramel notes with hints of toasted almonds and smoky dark fruits just a pleasure to drink with an expensive cigar or with a cheap whisky dipped tiparillo i will not have this vacate the top shelf of my whisky bar ever  best islay whisky i reckon fabulous whisky even better than laphroaig slightly more rounded with extra depth and complexity would buy it much more frequently except laphroaig is half the price and for this money it just can 39 t compete with uigeadail it means i rarely get to sample it but that does make it all the more pleasurable when i do awesome tasting room on their distillery tour too check it out  love every drop of the bottle never fails to bring a smile to my face each time i settle down to a lagavulin 16  laphroaig 10 was my quot go to quot until i had a dram of the lagavulin 16 if you 39 re new to scottish whisky you likely won 39 t understand the complexity of islay single malts this is top notch islay anyone that says otherwise doesn 39 t get it  if this is the type of whisky you like smoke fire an entire peat bog thrown in but also some beautifully subtle background flavours if you seek them out you will definitely enjoy this as per others of this style it is for dyed in the wool whisky drinkers your non whisky drinking friends will probably not enjoy it all but it is excellent however having compared this side by side with current production ardbeg 10 and laphroaig 10 i am convinced it isn 39 t worth the extra spend and i definitely prefer both of these classic islays to this the lagavulin 16 has a slightly more obvious honey like almost cognac ish note but other than that i think it is a bit one dimensional compared with say the laphroaig it could be because the laphroaig is brighter in character an has more floral notes that make it seem more interesting i am still confident that for this style of whiskey take no prisoners assault on the senses the ardbeg 10 and the laphroaig 10 are really excellent for the price and i see no reason to deviate other than to try other fine whiskeys was hoping to find this amazing but sadly it isn 39 t it is however very good whiskey of course for my regular excellent but affordable whisky i would probably pick the ardbeg 10 every time and can recognise it blindfolded  this is exactly what scotch should taste like amber in your glass then you smell the smokiness when you first sniff your pour and then taste it as it spreads over your tongue fabulous  my absolute favorite smoky peaty rich and flavorful  i have to say on initial opening and quickly smelling the contents of the bottle i thought this was going to be a tough drink how wrong i was whilst the initial medicinal notes hit you savouring and working through the smokiness the taste develops to sweet and complex just wonderful even when finished i could sit a just inhale the now empty glass if you ve ever visited a black house on the isles you ll know exactly what i mean  my favourite dram smooth with just the right amount of peat  its a classic would be mindblowing at 46 percent but its lovely sweet smoky salty all the stuff you want is absolutely hideous trolling with ginger try bells or any cheap brandy with lemonade vodka enjoy i 39 m not going to sit here and say i didn 39 t buy this because i have a clue about it i bought it because it 39 s ron swanson from p amp r 39 s favorite drink hey they even made a offerman edition because of him and i 39 m very new into the whisky game but this tasted a may zing just that perfect amount of smoke mixed with the peat and a warm taste i definitely will be buying more and next time adding a steak with it  we thought it was absolutely vile the peat flavour is so overpowering no whisky should taste of antiseptic we tried it neat with ginger lemonade and with orange and we just couldn 39 t drink it our daughter spent so much money on it and we just can 39 t drink it our other daughter described it as the worst whisky she has ever tasted  received my bottle today and this is by far now one of my favourite whiskies along with ardbeg 10 first smell i was hit with sweet sherry then oak smoke it was smooth with absolute no burn just lovely and warming that my partner described as just what you need on a cold bonfire night great balance between sweet and peat with a lingering smokey after taste this was really the whisky i 39 ve been looking for and could not recommend highly enough definitely will purchase again  really good i am no scotch expert but years ago i used to drink chivas or johnnie walker black and thought that was the best there was and so gave it up but last year was a strange year and i decided to give scotch another try this time with a little research the variety of scotches is amazing i got me a little taste chart and few small bottles some are fairly pricey and was on my way hard to believe but i had never tasted a peated scotch if i had been given any one of them 20 years ago i wouldn 39 t have been able to identify what it was and i would never have thought i would like it the descriptions here are very interesting but what i know is that i like it best among the scotches i have tried so far i will always have a bottle of this around in case the urge for a sip or a glass should hit  the instant you open the bottle you know what you 39 re getting this is by far the most smoke in a bottle i 39 ve ever tasted it 39 s almost overwhelming but in a good way but the more experienced whisky enthusiasts will still pick out the depth of flavour at the back  supper supper supper yummy miss it so much hate covid 19 it is a crime that we can t share what we enjoy with each other nothing compares to sharing a dram and each other s company so sad looking forward to the day when we can be again  the peat fruity sweetness spices and oaky bitterness are well balanced  top notch hats off to lagavulin this one has it all bourbon sherry and smoke very rich flavoured and the peat smoke is perfectly balanced around 40 ppm as far as i can recall a true classic  very nice had a bottle for xmas 2020 just opened march 2021 very impressed very first whisky i fell in love smooth peaty late night smoky jazz whisky divine nice whisky quite peaty but is a bit strong on the char it has some interesting medicinal notes kind of like a strong lapsang suchong or bamboo charcoal hae cha for me personally i would use this to mix with some soda or tonic for a smokey drink would be great in smokey medicinal cocktails and mixers not sure how often i would drink neat even though i like peat the char is a little too much but still nice 4stars because although it is a very nice medicinal tasting whisky the char notes are a bit strong for me to sip on a regular if the char was dialed back just slightly allowing the rest of the whisky to come to the forefront then this would be a 5 star  it tastes of smoke we all know it very hard to drink you might enjoy it if you are a smoker and or firefighter  it is awesome very peaty but fantastic taste as well as excellent feeling after two glasses  wonderful sweet smokey lingering after taste just nice not to dry not to sweet with a nice warm finish very pleasant  a whiskey for leaders  the charcoal after taste is huge disappointment i really can t see buying this again full of peat but it works perfectly with the vanilla and other sweet notes this is the scotch that turned me on to islay can never go back my desert island single malt absolutely amazing peat smoke in the forefront wave after wave but somehow does not block the other absolutely stunning flavours wow  tasted like charcoal after taste was bitter and chemical  i recently received a bottle ad a gift what a wonderful surprise to me and my pallet so smooth and rich a true enjoyment  received this as a christmas gift one of the best islays i have ever had very smooth and far too easy to drink  ordered this as part of my christmas single malt haul and it quickly distinguished itself as the cream of the crop leathery notes on the nose a complex smoky flavour and sweet finish it 39 s smooth rich and moorish lagavulin 16yo is everything i look for in a quality glass of scotch  despite the bottle being free very disappointing considering the hype smooth and smokey but lacking the depth that other islays have not bad but would take port charlotte or ardbeg over this  dominant flavour is an earthy boggy peat very tasty and easy to drink  a joy  this stuff is pretty bloody amazing i treated myself to a bottle for christmas as i 39 ve never had it before but always heard good things i 39 m a huge fan of laphroaig port charlotte and talisker 163 50 from amazon and got to say it 39 s worth every penny it 39 s like sitting back in a leather armchair eating cinder toffee next to a log fire while your uncle smokes a pipe but all in a glass the colour is dark bronze new honey or deep amber the nose is smoky but the most complex islay i 39 ve ever smelled there 39 s a gentle iodine tang like burnt seaweed or a camp fire on the beach at night unlike talisker there 39 s no alcohol burn on the nostrils i just nosed it for 5 minutes before the first sip and what a first sip it 39 s gently warming like highland park or old pulteney then a sudden cascade of different flavours mingled together definitely some polished oak with a crackle of paprika or sweet chilli followed by a sudden dryness like syruped raisins pure heaven the finish is warm dry and gets longer with each sip it 39 s now 5 minutes later and i can still taste it absolutely gorgeous hats off beautiful dram  imo you can get no better peated whiskey absolute ballance absolute greatness  very much to my taste smooth and with the peaty taste that i really like would recommend it to anyone  always a pleasure to drink with a great hit of smoke mzb mature peaty taste that lingers on the tongue and in the memory superb i don 39 t drink this anymore since my wife died i loved it and even though i couldn 39 t afford it stuck with it for 20 years when the au rose i bought it by the case 6 for those of you here who don 39 t get it or sip away at it i only have feelings of sympathy after a hard shift at work i would half fill a glass and slowly skul the lot the place it took me to was far from care an excellent whiskey with the distinctive smokey peat taste of islay to be drunk slowly to savour the full flavour  easily the most complex and almost certainly the best of the island malts and one i drink only occasionally so as not to spoil myself for the others  my favourite islay and favourite single malt overall i do branch out and try other islays but i always come to lagavulin 16 yr old for me it is the perfect balance of smoke peat and sweet notes delicious  a delicious combination of smoke peat sherry notes with a hint of chocolate mint well balanced and rich  the first time for this one for me and really enjoyed it very smooth and thicker than other lagavulin i normally drink if you like a good full peat smoke taste then this is a must try  tastes like an electrical fire  i have tried laphroaig 10 ardbeg but this is the king i love it smokey very peaty rich just beautiful perhaps not one to start with if new to whisky just a beast  men i must start to question myself and stop drinking this top quality drug like sirup had the first bottle couple years ago bought a new one the year after and now it is like i buy three of these every year the laga is unique this camp fire smoky peat is outragesly good what the hell is wrong with you lagavulin stop doing this whisky or my wife will kill you all  fantastic i was introduced to it in 2002 on a visit to england and scotland i have always loved scotch this is the best incrediblly complex and rich love it neat  quite simply the best whisky bar none you can go to ardbeg for pure smoke but this winds that back a little which allows a multitude of flavours smell the glass the next morning and your instantly in some medieval pub or church old wood smell outstanding  on opening it 39 s not far off tcp intriguing but oh my quarter down the bottle i let it breath for a couple a months it 39 s better i think i like it bit kipperish its good its a whisky that most whisky collections will have in them but its not as good as it used to be even the color is different just dont add e150 to the bloody stuff it not hard  a silky but rich peat smoked whisky big smokey earthiness and cocoa with hints of seaweed and dark honey it really opens up when left to sit and the more delicately you sip it however if you don 39 t like peated whisky or that slightly medicinal iodine type note don 39 t bother  i 39 m not too keen on smoky numbers but had this in a free taster pack and pleasantly surprised it is a nice mix of sweet amp smoke unlike some out there which taste like you 39 re eating a bonfire first class lightly peated whisky i thoroughly recommend it 128513  a lovely smokey peaty whisky  ardbeg 10 nearly put me off smokey whiskey this is class  they say there s no accounting for taste i don t care for this whisky the smoke and peat flavors are too strong and out of balance for my taste i expected to like it thought i ought to like it i just don t it doesn t taste good to me i prefer the smoothness of a glenlivet 18 or 12 sorry ron swanson you re still the best man obviously  this drop is emblazoned with complexity from the pop of the cork to the heel a well balanced character is presented in the smoke brine sweet dark fruit covered in chocolate leather and thesherry infused oak simply magic  it was the whisky that got me hooked on isla style hooch so a first love if you will i do feel that 20 years on its not quite what it was and at the price point their is better still lovely though will forever remind me of my dad  love it definite must try for any whiskey drinker  my new favourite whisky this is a stunningly peaty and sweet malt  my favourite malt by a long long way peat and smoke obviously on the nose and well as leather i finally understand what paul weller meant when he sang the smell of brown leather it bended into the weather malt and citrus notes as well as a rich caramel excite the taste budsand leaves a long slow delightful aftertaste  it 39 s good but is it really that much better than laphroaig  a good drink but not what it was less peaty less smoky less phenolic altogether a lighter dram than a few years ago i 39 d still buy it again though  firstly i don 39 t like scotch i am a bourbon drinker as such i love a bit of peat even a lot of peat lagavulin gives me peat aplenty as well as peat i can enjoy the alcohol which also abounds there are so many more flavours in this beautifully made whiskey it is almost worth the price the irish have known the secret of peat long before they shared it with the new world it seems they also shared it with islay this is a whiskey which should never touch water or ice love it  just found a bottle i bought over 20 years ago and realise why i left it it is very pleasant initially with a complex gentle peaty tartness but the peat flavour albeit mild lingers long after everything else has gone  this is good stuff but i find it a bit overpriced for what it is nothing offensive about it well rounded and mellow really not much smoke or peatiness in my opinion heavy sherry influence lagavulin 8 is much rawer and frankly more interesting a very smooth and enjoyable dram this but a bit lacking for the price point especially the palate which i find a bit thin still worth 4 stars  caramel butterscotch toasted marshmallow graham cracker  a remarkable scotch that makes people understand why the simultaneously smoky savory sweet and velvety drink is so precious nose lightweight but smoky earthy and mossyflavor mellow silky smoky and hearty i 39 ve had many but this is the best by far this single malt is heaven if whisky has one my favourite by miles  was unsure at first due to its strong peaty aroma but it grew on me very quickly craftsmanship at its finest absolutely fantastic whiskey that holds its own in the top league with the big dogs  to me this is an absolutely superb whisky i had been drinking an 8 year old caol ila before i bought a small bottle of this to sample by comparison it was so unbelievably smooth and nuanced and i had to do everything in my power not to finish the whole bottle in one sitting i had no reservations about buying another bottle and currently is probably my favourite whisky  wonderful taste like leather smells full flavor hearty in the mouth and smooth with very little alcohol burn so you can enjoy the flavor  my first islay whisky definitely chose a great starting point really nice smoky and complex flavour  the best classic single malt whisky good whisky but not as good as the reviews suggest in my opinion i feel it relies on it s smoke and peat flavour to impress without too much else going on it has a certain dryness and some oak flavour the smokiness tends to disappear the more the bottle goes down  what a treat this is to drink smoky but not overly so and peaty without the tang a beautiful and reliable drink  by far my favourite smoky but the most beautiful smoky notes you 39 ll ever taste  i 39 ll start this off by saying i 39 m a fan of speyside whiskies i tried a laphroaig about 15 years ago and couldn 39 t get past the strong iodine antiseptic smell now more mature in years me that is and with so many outstanding reviews for this whisky plus of course an endorsement from the great ron swanson i decided to try another islay whisky and i chose this one purely for its popularity plus mom likens it to lapsang suchong which i love well i opened the bottle and was immediately hit in the face by the waft of antiseptic aromas again i 39 m afraid i just can 39 t get past it also lapsang this is not even the smokiness has a whiff of antiseptic that said i persevered and three or 4 sips in and the character really comes through this really is in a different class to laphroaig however to me islay whiskies remain the jazz music of whisky i can appreciate the quality i just don 39 t want to listen to it  my absolute favourite single malt whiskey  what a taste its just keeps coming deep and resonating love this whiskey and the smell its as captivating as the rich taste bit pricey but one dram can fill easy 40 minutes of sniffing and sipping no doubt this is a classic islay and there 39 s nothing i can add to other reviews regarding it 39 s nose etc but what irks me is the fact prices have risen steeply then knocked down to a 39 sale 39 price above what it was before as a marketing ploy and the reason the next bottle of islay i buy wont be lagavulin very complex and just hard to beat  i just started drinking whisk e y i tried jim beam all i tasted was a strong condensed oak wood flavor i had to pour it out i could not get past the eighth glass jameson is mostly all peppery monkey sholder is a good whisk e y lagavulin 16 is a very different whisk e y but definitely not a bad whisk e y i just need more time to get to know it and that i am definitely enjoying  lagavulin 16 is one of the few single malts i 39 ve tasted and it 39 s certainly a great one the thing about lagavulin is the deep smoke and thickness of the liquid it 39 s very enjoyable and most of all i noticed deep comfortable smoke thickness and malt 4 5 stars for this one no doubt  i 39 ve been practicing my drinking for many years this is what i 39 ve been practicing for enjoyed this savored this and for a moment drank in my years of hard work and felt like a grownup finally slan 39  i 39 ve tried to find a better whisky than this unsuccessfully this is still above all the others  the 16 year old lagavulin was the worst whisky that i have ever tasted the flavour gave the impression that the distillery had burned down and the whisky was wrung out of the ashes and underlying peat disgusting  magnificent  like drinking coffee from a leather mug but in a good way  lovely tipple cheers to the unnamed polish barman in inverness that introduced me to it  i like  i you like the ubiquitous islay profile o peat smoke and sweet nectar this is the bottle you need in your cabinet only negative is the price keeps going up  just finished the bottle i brought home for christmas lovely a full peaty flavour and enough depth to make me pause and think after every mouthful going onto my favourites list without a shadow of doubt my first taste of this alarmingly excellent whisky was when i made a film about it back in the 1970 39 s then it had a smoothness and a magical smoky peat aroma that no others possessed that has become less intense since the days of its ownership by distillers co but for my money now more than double the price it was then it is the best malt around  still the king of the islay single malts i have tried most of them and always compare them to this gem of a dram up there with the best in class  i am fully aware that i will get some hate for this review but i find the lagavulin 16 to be the most overrated whiskey in the market it s peaty notes taste artificial and mask over any flavour whiskey i feel as though because this whiskey is popular everyone has jumped on the bandwagon an automatically believes that it is a good whiskey long live balvenie  wonderful dram had to get another bottle  an islay gem with a delcious and well balanced combination of peat smoke and savory notes on the nose and palete  world class big hitter in every aspect simply brilliant the kenny dalglish of whiskeys 128077 128513  simply brilliant the best of all the islay single malt whiskys full of smoke and charcoal flavours great tasting at all levels  simply the finest islay has to offer it smells wonderful with the not so subtle smoky aroma from the bottle and tastes better i find a splash of water helps you appreciate the flavour probably not the whisky for an introduction to smoky peaty malts but never forgotten once tried my favourite whisky of any region my girlfriend got me another bottle of lag for christmas this just edges ardbeg uigeadail as my favourite single malt i never tire of it it 39 s absolutely superb such a lovely vanilla finish to it it makes the long scottish winter evenings almost something to look forward to  i never had the privilege of trying quot old quot lagavulin however against current affordable everyday islay whisky such as laphroaig 10 ardbeg etc i can 39 t help but rate lagavulin 16 ahead of them it 39 s just an exquisite single malt that is well worth the price while my dram of choice is laphroaig 10 cask strength if it happens to be unavailable at a sensible price i would wholly recommend lagavulin 16 and if that 39 s not available then ardbeg 10 ardbeg 10 packs more punch but lagavulin truly is a multi layered gem of a scotch that reacts well to small amounts of water and you can play with all night  i m a teetotaller i am not a big fan of alcohol but this whisky can turns me to alcoholic i can t resist when i see it in front me like dangling a piece of chocolate in front of a child face i like it to drink it anytime anywhere before i sleep mid day and when i wake up in the morning ohh you bloody lagavulin  like an angel peeing on your tongue  smoky sweet islay gem this whisky is an explosion of complex flavor that shows its maturity in nose and palette definitely my go to dram by the fire with a cubano sidemate  delicious  yes it s got worse over the years but it s still a fine fine whisky more depth and character than other entry level islay whisky very little smoke but more flavours if i drink a laphroaig 10 i feel like a dirty homeless uneducated imbecile if i drink a lagavulin 16 i feel like an earl of an english shire just more alcohol by volume please diageo  ive tried many a peated expression and i love many of them i thoroughly dislike lagavulin i feel like it has similar characteristics so other peated whiskies except it turns those positives to negatives iodine but bitter and unpleasant smoke but quickly fades and lacks balance liquorice aftertaste just no i realise i 39 m in the minority but i 39 ve been deeply unimpressed by this whisky i have heard so much about and can think of many other peated expressions i 39 d reach for first perhaps i has a bad bottle but i tasted nothing to make me come back for more  this is all you really need forget the rest my daughter gave me a bottle lagavulin 16 year old for my birthday she knows i like a dram on the odd evening i have enjoyed other peat whiskys on occasion but this 16year old is the best peaty whisky i have tasted on opening the bottle a very pleasant peat aroma with a hint vanilla the initial taste is peaty but not unpleasant rather warming sweet and smooth the taste hangs to the palate there is a hint of salted caramel and fruit peaty oak all in all a truly sophisticated whisky in truth the best of the best some people say some there is no bad whisky 39 s only some better than others this is one of the best i will always have a bottle of lagavulin 16 year old now many thank 39 s sarah jane x always a go to dram at my well stocked bar rarely disappoints with it 39 s intense and complex nose and palete smokey and sweet with hints of mint in the finish delicious and reasonably priced for a 16 year old whisky  lagavulin 16 used to be one of my desert island top 5 whiskies however i haven 39 t had it for a while and the bottle i opened last evening left me feeling rather disappointed never mind desert island i wouldn 39 t even take it on a day trip to bute admittedly recently i 39 ve been spending more time with 46 and cask strength ncf campbeltown whiskies and carn mor editions so perhaps the lagavulin seemed a bit tame by comparison but the peat and sea spray attack seemed rather muted and the salty dryness in the finish wasn 39 t as expected don 39 t get me wrong this is still a very good dram and at under 163 50 better value that several other 15 16 year old malts but maybe it 39 s being left behind a bit in its 43 and chill filtered state  it s reminiscent of those teenage parties when you sculled for lager the morning after and swigged from a half crushed can of hoffmeister that someone had used as an ashtray add a swig of tcp from your mums medicine cabinet and there you have it lagavulin 16 just delicious still a phenomenal whisky despite diageo 39 s best efforts to conventionalize its taste  a proper drop of islay scotch rich smokey and smooth a definite mainstay on my top shelf  smoky but very nice  all i taste is smoke intense deep caramel sweet and peaty nose smoky with liquorice notes long dry spicy finish  bought it yesterday what have you done to lagavulin now it 39 s like cheap vodka with added liquid smoke very harsh yes it 39 s without paper seal bottled 16 jan 19  very nice whisky smokey apple notes with a long sweet finish  i am surprised to say i like the lagavulin 16 so smokey and slightly rough luckily i like it rough no water needed notes of crisp apple vanilla undertones and finishes with a sweet salted caramel aftertaste just exquisite  best islay whisky my favourite of all time i wasn t ready for the smokiness but was quite impressed over time the smoothness and mellow aftertaste is sweet perfection sadly i can t go 5 stars because i tried it in the wrong setting but knowing what i know now i d find the perfect snack to go with it might also be my phobia of liquid smoke in food or sauces but very impressive and belongs in the cabinet for sure the long spicy finish is great i 39 m just a begginner and i really like smoky and quot cors 233 quot brevage this one did impress me for my first islay malt 9 10 this islay beauty is an exceptional balance of sweet and savory notes the nose is met with a woody char with dried fruits and a hint of mint the palate has a delicious bbq brisket flavor with caramelized brown sugar phenols and sweet almonds ion the back  from australia when the lagavulin was imported from islay with the little quot property of the distillery quot paper seal it was a magnificent dram sadly since the paper seal disappeared the quality has dropped as well nobody has owned up to this why  a whisky that is delicious and characterized by well balanced flavor or peat smoke dried fruits salted toffee and coastal wafts of seaweed and shoreline breeze pairing this with brisket double smokedy cheese and red grapes is heaven only to be complimented by a cubano at the end cheers  liquid gold with a momentous palate and lasting finish well balanced notes of peat smoke dried fruit and oaky salted toffee in the back paired with bbq brisket smoky cheese and red grapes can only be beaten by a nice cubano to follow magnificent  this is how all whisky should be very elegant classic and luxurious very satisfying sipping whisky very suitable for fathers like me  tastes like industrial cleaner  i tried my very first lagavulin 16 on monday evening what a wonderful dram left it in the glass for a good 16 minutes nosing continually it is without doubt the most beautiful single malt i have ever had the pleasure to taste wonderful  i was given a dram at a local bar and it was my first sampling of this single malt whisky needless to say it was love at first nose and taste who cares if a little coloring is added or it is chill filtered the taste blows those considerations away if you can make a whisky this good by adding those ingredients then please sir i want more brilliant diageo  hmmm ok the positives it s a nice dram smokey dried fruits with a hint of salt worth a try negatives well i just wish diageo were as good at making a quality whisky as they are at marketing it getting someone as cool and manly as ron swanson to endorse your product is a stroke of genius because that s all this dram has over other islays it s over priced 163 49 in the uk packed with e150 which is strange as you would have thought that a 16 year old would have obtained enough colour from the barrels it s chill filtered which i m sure is fine for those who like adding ice in their whisky theirs better whiskies out there and better islay s ardbeg is a better drink no chill filtered no e150 it s a pretty pale colour i find it more smokey and more complex in short it s a nice dram but it s time to try something different and something better forget the marketing it s time to tell diageo to get lagavulin back to the better quality whisky it used to be  such an exquisite blend of sophistication and romantic roughness that each mouthful practically takes your breath away  i just finished a bottle and i want to cry i bought a laphroig 10 as it was on special offer and it just doesn 39 t cut the mustard the smoke 39 s there but not the rest of it and the mouth feel is pathetic by comparison i 39 m not going to pretend i 39 m some whisky buff i can 39 t tell you what it is about this that i love so much about this whisky but it 39 s pretty much perfect for me  probably my favorite whiskey ever and i m normally a bourbon drinker so weird and delicious  for a whisky that is chill filtered and color added i still haven 39 t found a better dram in the 16 year old range that is otherwise more impacting on nose and pallate it is so well balanced with smoke and sweetness that you begin to salivate witha simple nosing would love to see this whisky at a higher abv for the money  strong smokey and peppery just the way tony stark and rdj likes it no wonder tony chose this as the scotch brand of his choice i shared this with several friends of mine after endgame to celebrate 10 years of avengers and the infinity saga and i can confess this is one hell of a scotch to toast to a lovely deep flavour that rolls all the way into the deep smoke that the nose promises an incredibly decent whisky to sink back with at the end of a long day i 39 m not saving this for special occasions i am keeping this one close at hand  i like my scotch chilled with an ice ball not fancy metal bearings i feel the little water that gets to the scotch changes the flavor a touch without the ice i get more of the iodine sharpness i m fine with this pour it over an ice ball and it becomes a little something else still smokey very much so but a mellow oak ness that sits with the palate for a good while after the initial taste it is my go to scotch if you like a fine cigar or pipe without the doctor yelling at you this scotch is for you  for islay malt i like laphroaig much more i feel that the lag 16 is a bit sharp to the taste and not what i remember from prior to the diageo takeover  i 39 m sorry who puts no and then basically insults everyone else as being an inexperienced drinker because of their 4 5 star reviews how rude love this whisky and have been drinking it for quite some time couldn 39 t really care less what others think i 39 ve tasted a lot of whisky in my time this is still my favourite and if you prefer the taste of bells well then that 39 s up to you  the only whisky i love after an amazing initial introduction to lots of different whiskies in a pub in inverliever 20 years ago  from the moment i tried it i knew this was the one no need for over analysis i enjoy every sip and diageo and e150 are the furthest thing from my mind absolutely wonderful if i could only drink one dram from now on this would be it  i feel the rating on this is from diageo s marketing and from inexperienced consumers this is not an example of what a good islay scotch has to offer overpriced watered down chill filtered loads of e150 added not very complex especially for a 16 year old this has great potential but it s not even close to where it should be fix the things listed above and put some quality and care into the spirit itself and it would be one of the best instead of trying to use marketing gimmicks to appeal and fool inexperienced drinkers diageo is much more worried about its profits than making a good product just like so many companies now a days and people aren t educated enough to see it i guess  a quiet crisp cool evening alone sitting on an old comfortable camping chair deep in the woods with a warm comfortable fire at hand the smell of sweet smoke wafting near by so looking forward to the next  if you like islay type whiskeys you will love this scotch it remains the standard to which other islay whiskies are judged just buy it you will not be disappointed  a huge whisky big smokey hit on the initial nose gives way to medicinal iodine and vanilla again lots of smoke on the initial palate with sherry vanilla dried fruits and some spice developing through the mid watch out for the big peaty leathery kick on the back palate to finish long finish with the more subtle notes lingering sherry spices and vanilla oaky sweetness develops at the last i do agree with those that think this whisky is a bit overrated it lacks a certain subtlety and refinement of balance to my taste  it 39 s good expected a bit more after the reviews but it 39 s good maybe a bit pricey  i feel half these reviews are from diageos marketing abilities rather than the drink itself e150 low abv slightly complex but nothing special and a huge increase in price recently make this an ok dram at an extremely high price this is good don t get me wrong but that s it good as far as even close to the smokiest nose from an islay that s just plain not true there are great drinks out there for this price at least in my area i ve seen it 80 usd on the low end and 130 at the top it has a good flavor to it and is smooth but could really benefit from a higher abv but that means profit decreases for diageo and as long as people who have not expanded their islay horizons past this are flocking to the stuff it won t change but that s who it s made for i guess people who don t mind the fake color high prices and a watered down dram anyway to they drink itself salty meats dried fruit peat smoke cream 85 100 i love you you sweet whiskey keep doing what you re doing my go to daily dram yes an expensive habbit but you only live once this gem is an inculcation of the spirit of islay the amazing nose and delicious palate make it a sensory experience we can all use a little quot me quot time with something a memorable as lagavulin 16 cheers  when i first tried laga 16 i was a little underwhelmed i 39 d read so many reviews of it being 39 the one 39 but it seemed just another islay some iodine some smoked kippers and the rest of the usual suspects for hebridean whisky next to my ledaig 18 it seemed a little one dimensional i did however persist and keep returning to it one magical night after a dram of a single barrelcask strength bourbon i came back to it a few drops of water 15 mins to open up and i took a sip suddenly it revealed itself to me in all its glory the balance is just exceptional it opens with a salvo of mellow smoke followed by a flash of aniseed on the tongue before sherry and chocolate sit on top of a blustery western shore it fades into the distance leaving smoked meats chocolate and oak finally dissipating to fennel seed on the back of the tongue i don 39 t know why it took me so long to fully appreciate its glory but it 39 s a great great whisky  delicious on the nose and on the taste dried fruit caramel vanilla bbq sherried biscuits peat brine savory roasted almonds with baked apples hit of mint and sweet and sour plum sauce and of cousre smoke  the title says it all as a fan of peated whiskeys there are 2 bottles i return to the lagavulin 16 on fridays and better days and the talisker dark storm on weekdays its a wonderfull whiskey the aroma peated but not too agressive woody and relaxing the taste reflects the peatiness as opposed to a laphroaig where smell beats taste with some sea and leather in there if you take the peated whiskey trip start with a talisker skye work your way up to talisker 10 dark storm and finally a lagavulin hope you will appreciate it as i did  this scotch belongs in a place of honor delicious both on the nose and on the palate the earthy notes and seaside brine meld nicely with a sweetness that lingers and finishes with the classic islay conviction the best value for a 16 year old anywhere  for me the laga 16 is a wonderful example of peat iodine age and balance very consistent at least in the few years i have drank it not as out going as the ardbergs or laphroiags but the balance and age always makes me sit back and think oh yeah  consistently unbelievable my favourite single malt without question last bottle was slightly different to those in the past possibly more salty briney still remains my number one the flavour is true and comforting earthy smoke with sweet brine good finish superb with a few drops of water i have never been disappointed  intense different outstanding on a scale of 1 to 10 a solid 8 this is the drink i buy when i have been through a serious whisky line up and i have had enough it takes everything to a whole new level smokiness spice heat the whole load my secret weapon during a whisky duel  delicious infusion of earthy peat and bonfire aromas with a sweet sherried cask undertones the finish is classic islay rich longlasting and very well balalnced a masterpiece  this is the first whiskey i 39 ve tried that goes down painlessly leaving you to savor the deliciousness of its lasting spice riddled flavor  i can 39 t say enough good things about this one its got it all peat smoke oak and spice incredible nose intense flavors that linger and a ton of bold character to boot put it on your list you will not be disappointed  always bought whiskies based on what s on offer at tesco but decided yes after parks and rec to treat myself to lagavulin do i like it yes the nose is smoky with spice and a hint of vanilla the taste is nothing like i ve tried before definitely the smokiest dram but not as iodine ridden as laphroaig it s got an earthy taste and a dryness that i ve not had in even other islay s it is a lovely whisky but it s either your taste or not for me it s a unique and one i ll be coming back to  this is a great scotch one must have this in your house at all times came back to this laga after couple month drinking others islay highland whiskys as well as japanese and even indian amrut i may have tried 50 different bottles you can have it at 55 chf here in switzerland sometimes for less than 50 chf and for this price it is a gift men this is good it is like japanese blend 39 s top quality dram mixed with the best smoky taste i ever had i think i should go there in scotland tell the guys from laga how perfect this whisky is bravo les gars  so i got this for the xmas period never tried it before and have to say i did enjoy it it reminds me of a whisky for the more experienced who enjoy a smoker flavour however i m still fairly new to the market and enjoyed this so if your debating then give it a go for sure  rich yes dry no i find a hint of honey in this scotch it makes me wonder if it spent a little time in an oloroso sherry cask as for smokiness i liked the comparison to lapsang souchong of which islay malts have always reminded me both the tea and the scotch can wonderfully take the edge off a winter afternoon  to the 1 star man on 28th february 2018 when you hated your bottle and threw it out did you by chance just leave in the bottle and leave the bottle in a clean bag or bin somewhere and would that bottle still be in your possession if so i have a warm home for the quot burnt forest fire quot you disliked so much my waiting maw my catch phrase used to be quot i don 39 t drink scotch but when i do it has heather honey saffron and spices in it quot then i tried laphroaig and i liked it very much then i got stuck out of town with nothing to do but watch netflix and picked parks and rec then i tried lagavulin now when i talk about lagavulin i only use a nick offerman accent it 39 s that good i have ardbeg 10 and was just gifted another bottle but i 39 m afraid it will be exchanged for my first owned bottle of 16 cheers to those who enjoy the king of scotch  just stop reading this a pour yourself a generous dram keep it in your mouth for 20 seconds and fly away  i 39 ve had a bottle of 16 year lagavulin for 4 years now and it 39 s never been opened the last time i drank it and i had a few was in 1997 and the memory of it has stayed with me for these past 21 years i will think about opening it soon  i do believe chill filtering takes the soul out of the liquid glenlivet and glenfiddich chill filter the hell out of their bland whisky and there 39 s nothing there this however i don 39 t know what it is but nothing compares to it or comes close the balance of peat sherry fruit and grain has a finesse i have never experienced in any other whisky and as i make my way through my 3rd bottle of this in the past few months i have to say i haven 39 t had anything better in a couple hundred i 39 ve tried  my partner 39 s go to whisky and her favourite islay malt  i 39 m either missing something got a bad batch or this bottle does not hold up to the competition i e my ardbeg uigeadail comparing the 2 i find the laga 16 lacking in flavour i honestly don 39 t get the hype i really wanted to like this and bought it due to the strong recommendations it delivers in peat but the rest i feel i find it under powered compared to my ardbeg uigeadail which i find far more enjoyable  purchased this last christmas for a gift it arrived extremely well packaged you have to fold the box up yourself which is a good idea as then it keeps it immaculate delicious whisky to enjoy  my favorite was laphroaig 10 for the longest time until i had this i also love ardbeg 10 i feel laphroaig leans on a deeper tar aroma ardbeg on a super well balanced smoky smooth dram lagavulin on the other hand incorporates both of these splendidly as a base then adds a top notch oak spice and roast that just takes you home  a fantastic peaty masterpiece addictive  it 39 s worth way more than bargain barrel prices don 39 t give it away for crying out loud ninety bucks very nice possibly the best value for money single malt 163 44 duty free for a 16 y o is commendable i would buy again certainly when compared to the nas offerings from the other island distilleries however the colour is faked with caramel it has been chill filtered so the flavour is diminished shame to my mind it isn 39 t as good as it used to be 2018 the lag16 seems 39 smoother 39 and has less islay character to the palate this starts off very well smoke peat and rounded rich sherry character the finish becomes harsher with some faults i imagine this will please the shills who like to use the word 39 go to 39  a mans whisky imagine you ve boiled an old work horses harness for several days my favourite for many years  been my go to single malt for over 20 years just got gifted a new bottle from a neighbour who also appreciates the islay he is now my favourite neighbour  my go to scotch the smokey flavor is outstanding and the peat isn 39 t overpowering a wonderful whisky to sip although it can start tasting a little too good so make sure to limit yourself  i have tried couple other islay whisky and i find this one to be very balance and more subtile than the others in the same price range you have the peat the frutiness and also a long finished reminds me of the laphroaig 10yo kind of taste not only peat but some sweetness and character i have also tried the 2000 distiller edition which for me is the best whisky so fare i have ever had it taste quiet the same the de has more complexity and is more on the honey and vanilla where de 16yo is more on fresh fruits like lemon and orange in the end very good but not perfect  an absolute delight  this is my favorite scotch at the moment my sister turned me on to the islay versions a few years ago and after many sampling s this is the one i continue to return to strong but not over powering smooth but not easy drinking simply perfect with a cut of steak and a buttered baked potato  its a great tasting whisky goes down smoothly over the course of an evening especially with good friends love it very unique taste probabily one of the better malt of scotland superb peaty but with full body this is the kind if whisky i stop drinking once my bottle is half empty and only enjoy again once i have a back up replacement the thought of having to go thru life without a lagavulin 16 on my whisky shelf is just to scary  too much for me at this time prefer glenfiddich oban glenkichie etc  earthy rich amp smoky simply the best  peat smoke and iodine rise from the glass upon sipping i first noticed the astringency often compared to a good tea then the massive malt backbone asserted itself despite its age the cask does not dominate the flavor the peat smoke iodine malt and cask all assert themselves then leave behind the iodine and a bit of phenolic resin but not nearly as much as laphroaig  i replaced water in my daily intake of liquids with this one  a very peculiar taste the aroma and the flavour had me on a bit of a quest an adventurous quest  my wife bought me a bottle for christmas she has regretted it ever since i have not  my to go whiskey ron swanson  always the best absolutely delightful you can tell this scotch has historic experience behind it  i never knew i liked scotch until i tried this smoke vanilla cherry and did i mention smoke  simply stunning i get lots of mellow peppery cigar smoke and a sweetness that borders on wine gums one of the nicest i have ever tasted and definitely the best of the islays  i appreciate all the regions and their expressions but no other whisky comes close for me sitting in front of the fire with my dog after a day in scottish mountains 2 glasses in to a dusty laga 16 can 39 t get much better ignore the low star reviews bemoaning too smoky or peaty this is not a dram for some palates that said you can 39 t fairly criticise an islay for having the characteristics of an islay in the same way you can 39 t criticise a cat for not being a dog as it were if you appreciate islay whisky know what you are buying and have half an idea what to expect then you can do no wrong here beats excellent ardbeg and laphroaig equivalents king to the islay princes  all my life i ve avoided europe and it s multitudes of terribleness but it turns out much to my surprise there is actually one place in europe that is worth seeing these tiny islands off the coast of scotland where god s chosen elixirs are distilled barrelled and prepared for consumption this is worth the trip  this is my favourite scotch i also like the distillers editions  the one that made me an whisky enthusiast absolute classic  i have spent 20 years and a lot of money trying to find a better whisky i give up  every time i try to branch out and try another whisky i just end up being disappointed it 39 s not lagavulin 16  i ve wanted to try this for a while but always opted for a slightly cheaper laphroaig or bowmore i got a bottle for my 40th though and it is beautiful i m not too techy with the descriptors a whiff of vanilla a hint of old boot leather etc but if you love the peatiness of islay whisky then this has it in spades it s as peaty as laphroaig 10 but mellower at the same time my favourite scotch by a long way  if you like a peaty whisky this should absolutely be in your glass  i made a pledge to review every whisky i drink to educate the world about the finer points of whisky he said optimistically but this review is a total waste of time as all of us already know lv 16 is a masterclass in smoky peatiness infused with sea air and seaweed yet perfectly mixed with a good slug of your granny 39 s sweet and sumptuous cream sherry an absolute must have classic i 39 ll stop wasting my time now  as a devoted fan of islay malts lagavulin 16 is the standard to which all others are compared an absolute quot must have quot in a malt whiskey lover 39 s cabinet a sublime marriage of carefully controlled peatiness and smoke with an aged complexity that is unmatched by other islay malts  nothing better than lagavulin and a good cigar a match made in heaven  as a relative newcomer to scotch i quot grew up quot on the johnny walkers dewars etc this past christmas my wife knowing my fondness for smoky flavor profiles in both food and beer although not a scotch drinker herself had treated me to a bottle of ardbeg which i absolutely loved from the very first sip more recently she suggested that i try some lagavulin 16 as her research indicated that it might be something that i would enjoy boy was she ever right to me this is like a fruitier more mellow cousin to ardbeg just a beautiful and elegant sip as long as you know what you are getting into i 39 m still learning about scotch but lagavulin 16 was a most welcome and successful lesson i give it an a  this is the only bottle in the world that i always make sure i have two of an open one and one behind it on case the zombie apocalypse comes before i can buy another true story  i had my first taste of this whisky about 10 years ago and never looked back it isn 39 t for the meek or first time tasters but if you have been meddling with some other malts and want to go up and taste what it is like to taste the best then treat yourself savour this flavour and you will never go back this is the usain bolt of smokey whisky from islay simply the best  this is by far one of the best whisky 39 s i 39 ve ever drank  warm earthy with just enough sweetness if you don t like smoke don t drink it if you do you won t find a better scotch  how can i have been so ignorant of this whisky until now absolutely outstanding and by far the most balanced whisky i 39 ve had so far i started off avoiding peated whiskies but this is so smooth and luxurious that the peat adds to it as another reviewer commented this is like the rolls royce of whiskies  one of ron swanson s favorites  throw my 5 stars on to the pile simply outstanding the peat  i was treated oh yes it was a treat to this by my son my first thought was quot wait what is this oh my god quot i 39 m a novice only been drinking single malts a couple of years i don 39 t have the nose knowledge of most of those on this site all i know is that in all my 74 years i 39 ve never tasted any whiskey anywhere near this good i 39 ve never had an emotional reaction to a whiskey before many thanks to my son shawn  spirit of islay and peated whisky perfect taste smokey sweet peated and strong you should taste a new thing where it simply described by lagavulin 16yo wonderful  simply the rolls royce of whisky i love taking my customers on a whisky tour of my bar and finishing off with this the most perfectly balanced of all whisky you could say the more expensive the car the more the engine knows what it s doing lagavulin 16 as described by the bike enthusiast of beinglas  老女人 don 39 t normally go for a peaty taste but this is so smooth i really like it yes it is smokey but the taste is so gentle no real bite which i miss but for a relaxing smooth dram can 39 t fault it very different from my usual but a welcome distraction  very nice very wood smoke quite complex and powerful taste very much different experience than smell downfall is that it should not be coloured and should certainly not be chill filtered  how can anyone possibly have a quot favourite quot whisky so many that are so good but whenever i drink this it 39 s like falling in love all over again incredibly smooth deliciously smokey and just enough creamy sweetness beautiful smoked oyster flavours and a warm mellow afterglow that makes the world just back off for a while ps i can 39 t stand lapsang souchong tea  i can t believe all the 1 star reviews because this is too smokey that s as crazy as buying a ferrari and giving it 1 star because it s too fast know what you re drinking lagavulin is the daddy of smokey isla s it s certainly not a beginners drink but when you understand what s in your glass there s no finer drop of whisky smokey meaty with a hint of angel s tears and unicorn sweat in short it s magical  my new favourite beats all other scotches i 39 ve tried by a landslide sweet rich warm and meaty if you have learned to taste past the smoke it is incredible  although i don 39 t ordinarily consider lifestyle advice from anyone in hollywood worth a grain of salt i have to confess i bought my first bottle of lagavulin 16 because quot ron swanson quot actor nick offerman raved about it so much the best whisky i have ever tasted period but not recommended for the quot whine and cheese quot crowd  it s so smoky yes but also so balanced with sweet dark dried fruit and a lovely mint like finish i can t find a better dram  definitely the best whisky i ve ever tasted it is definitely smokey and it s aromas are powerful it is smooth flavorful and aged to perfection  i think it is attrocious tastes like i 39 m drinking a burned out forest fire awful threw it out  a work of art yeah there 39 s smoke throughout but it 39 s not overwhelming and its beautifully balanced by a malty sweetness and sherry undertones i love spending time alone with this bottle and get a feeling of melancholy when i see the end is near like saying goodbye to a dear friend  i really prefer this compared to ardbeg 10 and laphroaig 10 very smooth earthy smoky and rich flavour it costs around 85 where i live but for me it 39 s the best isla whisky for under 100  quite simply a stunning malt it takes a special whisky to call my favourite but lagavulin 16yo is that whisky nicer than lagavulin distillers edition just enjoy with a little drop of water to bring out the flavours do not buy or give poor reviews if peaty malts are not for you  i recently had the chance to try 16 and 18 year old within 24 hours of each other so i had a bit of a think about the two this is no small wonder for me as i am a cheap fan of great scotch not easy i realize there are far more expensive bottles out there but 50 a bottle for me is above my price range at the moment it won t be for very much longer i do not have a refined palette or nose i do not know all of the technical terminology but i know what i like and i loved the 16 and the 18 absolutely through and through it is uncompromisingly bold and the most delicious whisky i ve ever had my gums round the best way i can describe it to those on the fence about trying it is that it is absolutely like drinking the outdoors if that were possible earthy smoky and sweet it reminded me of all my boyhood camping trips replete with nights around the bonfire and roasted marshmallows i m not sure what being a newcomer to drinking scotch has to do with anything but if any of that appeals to you do not hesitate to purchase this  it has been a while since i 39 ve a bottle of this whisky which is strange since for years it was my favourite i opened my new bottle last evening and was pleased to find it as excellent as i remembered the nose was peat and sea and the first thing to hit me on the palate was the dry peaty smoke that ended with salt and pepper and went on forever great to get a 16 yo islay for this price too well done mom  this is a scotch that is truly amazing if you are in the right mood i find it is best in cold weather especially for the price it has extreme depth and flavor however if you don 39 t like smoke you definitely will not like this one what i like is the way the smoke somehow transforms into sweet on the nose and on the palate  tastes like a camp fire nirvanic waters majestic malt tindered stew just plain delicious  lagavulin 16 39 s distinctive smokey notes and sweetness make this an excellent drink with a a cubano cigar with some smoked oysters kick your feet up and enjoy the vida loca  never had a taste for scotch whisky until i tasted this around here it is 80 a bottle i don t buy it often but it is the only scotch i buy and i don t share it with just anybody hard to believe people saying they didn t like it because it was too smoky i notice no middle of the road reviews love it or hate it  somebody complained it was peaty outstanding scotch not for me the smokiness is over powering and tastes like a chemical has been added like dettol however it 39 s probably a drink that you need to make you 39 re way up to as opposed to just jumping in  surprised someone buys lagavulin 16 then punishes the whisky with 1 2 star because it 39 s too smokey i 39 d just say it 39 s wise to do a little research before purchase among my favorites this was my go to for years amp would get all the stars until i started to notice a drastic change in the palate maybe the 16yr old is running short if you have a fantastic seller and product runs short what do you do go broke or start mixing you be the judge  nose full and ritch iodine peat classic sea note salty tangy rotten seaweed there is a little sherry note in the backround there is meat on the nose smoked meat pork chops fish etcthere also are some spices and wood notesovertime the iodine starts to mellow down same with the peat now there is a little more sherry and coastal notes palate full impact with a lot of great rich notes iodine coastal oaky and in the background some sherry notes little plum its spicy there are a bunch of spices nutmeg and a little cinnamon meaty something smoked from a pig with some fish finsih aftertaste now the barrel kicks in chocolate sherry notes deep full rich milk chocolate almost lile a pudding there is also oakyness not to much then this meaty feeling keeps hanging arround its a really good whisky i dont add any water in my opinion it doesn 39 t need it but if you want you can add some it can handle it when you leave this in the bottle sitting with about 3 4 left for a couple weeks months it gets really rich and there is more meat and chocolateand sherry overall an amazing whisky and i am going to buy more its a perfect product but i would love to see a little more abv and natural colour normally i wouldn t give a whisky with lower abv and colour addeda 10 10 but the nose finish palate aftertaste and of course the value is amazing so yes this gets a 10 10 for me and it will always be one of myfavourites cheers  to much of a smokey taste take a super high quality single malt scotch whisky sit it on your wood fired grill for oh say 45 minutes and taste a miraculous transformation that 39 s islay malt don 39 t ever really do this and more specifically the king of islay malts i don 39 t dislike highlands campbeltowns or lowlands but if i were restricted to one whisky or even one whiskey lagavulin would be my hands down choice the smoke and peat of the process the influence of the hundreds of millions of years old rocks the char of the old oak casks that 39 s the heart and soul of a satisfying dram nothing better  just the right amount of everything with a long finish that just makes you want another one smokey sweet and savory mouthwatering slightly medicinal from the distinctive peat from the isla shores that serves up this delicious and intoxicating love lava you can 39 t go wrong with lagggy 16  iv just had a few drams of lagavulin white horse bottling and have too agree with others that it is better than todays bottles worth trying too find a bottle if you can my favorite dram if you take a small sip on the front of your tongue you taste the sweetness if allowed to the back of tongue you get all the smoky richness  the tasting note above was pretty much spot on except for the finish this is a wonderful scotch but not as smoky as i was hoping  just amazing peated smoke loved it  i didnt find any quot smoke quot its smooth like drinking water no alcohol bite at all which is a bit awkward nose iodine taste iodine and sherry all the way  exceptional distinctive taste as soon as this exquisite single malt from the best scotch whiskey producing region from the great land of scotland touches your taste buds you know you have made a decision that will forever form your selection of scotch whiskey there are many scotch s that have a hollow taste and you swallow as soon as possible but with the lagavulin 16 you relish this fine whiskey coating your palate with the aromas of smokey peat scottish sea air and the sweetness of vanilla to each his own but as for me and my house lagavulin 16 is what is served here  this is a must try for any true scotch fan it carries a hefty price tag at 110 a bottle in my area but is as good as it gets try laphroaig 10 year for about half the price as a good alternate for an extra peaty scotch the laphroaig however is a bit more medicinal whereas the lagavulin has some excellent fruit notes for any parks and rec fans out there lagavulin is ron swanson s drink of choice per whiski rooms edinburgh nose full on lot 39 s of wood smoke surrounding surprising sweetness white pepper palate smoke marmalade and toffee develops some oily notes sea air comes through towards the end finish a dry finish with that bear hug of peat seemingly lasting forever couldn 39 t agree more after my flight of peaty malts at whiski rooms best of the peats for me sip it slow exhale thru nose beautiful add drop of water for slightly different bouquet  i m not a specialist in irish or scotch whiskey but i had in years many of pleasant taste or very good or exceptionali bought among others this 16 y old lagavulin recently for a new year gathering in my house we opened it and found smoked poison liquid inside the bottle disgusting never had in my mouth garbage like this even in the college years take my advice please don t even try it is real garbage what a waste of money something must be wrong with people giving stars to this product an excellent whisky could do without the colouring and all that as well as a well rounded 46 to make it even better can you find more unknown and better gems for the price most certainly yes however this cant be missed if you love peaty whisky a true classic disgusting lagavulin is the first single malt i ever tasted and i guess i just took a liking to its complex palate and spicy finish i like all the single malts each one seems like it has something special to offer this one just holds the top spot for me  if ing you like the taste of creosote with hints of kelp and a little touch of iodine spent pipe tobacco fishboxes and kippers the this is the drink for you have you ever walked though a house the day after it burned to the ground that is what the smokey smell reminds me of one big toxic ash tray it was slightly better after it was allowed to breathe for a while or was that after the ice was allowed to melt if this is your drink bottoms up you can have it  while strong peata balaced scotch whiskeytry a couple of ice cubes and let the evening grow richer i was very hyped about this i tasted a lot of whiskies but this is the first one that i so disliked that i didnt even finish my glass it tasted like shoe polish acetone i just stick to my glenfiddich glenmorangie bourbons too smokey for this american of irish descent not quite as strong as those that make me feel as is i licked the campfire but it just doesn t work for me  enjoyed looking at the bottle with a friend was not game to open it at 90 enjoyed a beer instead  a friend is a dedicated islay man im a novice but wanted to see what the fuss was about ive treated myself to a bottle of this novice or not this is spectacular islay and lagavulin 16 for me when i have another excuse to treat myself wait my birthday on january 1st first excuse covered  it 39 s like sitting downwind from a bonfire i love it and i 39 m a speyside guy so masculine i love it makes me live above my means like a true american  my boyfriend cites lagavulin 16 as his favorite whiskey of laphroaig and glenlivet i think it 39 s smoky oaky and vanilla y really smooth also though it is ultimately overpriced as others have said here you won 39 t find a better product and shipping price than at master of malt other sites prompted me to pay 100 to have lagavulin 16 sent to my boyfriend my one complaint is about the gift message i know it 39 s free but it comes in the form of a shitty sticker that i 39 m supposed to what stick directly on the bottle type or hand write it on a pretty little card guys c 39 mon it 39 s good whiskey bejesus  if you don 39 t like this you don 39 t like islay i had a crazy highland loyalist tell me he dumped half a bottle down the drain i probably would have given him at least 30 for it smoke and peat all the way what a wonderful whisky powerfully smoky and rich sipping it now and loving it  what a wonderful whisky this 16 year old is if i could afford it i would drink little else treat yourself  great smoke flavor absolutely wonderful explosion on the palate with a smooth follow up i love this scotch  i m no expert but i know what i like and this is very very good a multi layered and surprising experience  peat campfire ashes sweet and salty brine roasted chestnuts and aromatic notes of the sea a superb dram for the discerning scotch drinker wish it were bottled at a higher abv  i 39 m also cynically unimpressed with the big corp mentality and whilst it tuned my head to the dark side 25 years ago it 39 s not what it was or maybe everyone else just does it better for less i prefer talisker 10 and talisker storm in fact the tesco only highland park dragon thing is a more rounded and an equal a fist in a velvet glove perhaps i think that ardbeg has got the crown of the smoky peaty monster well and truly in its grip and the laga is not the benchmark it once was especially at it 39 s over now over inflated price  the cognac of scotches like a depth charge a sip goes whoooomphhh oak and smoke that 39 s not a joke sherry and berry yes it 39 s sweet and all the peat then an old cigarand a hint of tar but now my poem went too far  great smoky taste it 39 s like an explosion inside your mouth with a gentle but heavenly smoky fire it 39 s awesome just love it  best wicket around not for beginners  i really enjoy the bold flavor it is a new favorite excellent drink  first tried this while sitting around a bonfire it has a great smoky flavor i told my wife it was like i was drinking the bonfire it is an excellent scotch  the lagavulin 16 is a calm explosion of nose plate and finish fruity smoky and incredibly rich it exudes excellence and is well worth its price however it is a bit too sweet for my taste perhaps that is preferred by some but this lagavulin is in my opinion more suitable to accompany a desert the sweetness simply becomes too overbearing when enjoyed on its own  i 39 m seeing reviews about how it has color added and it 39 s cool filtered and how that affects the flavor who cares i don 39 t care what they put in it our what they take it if it the only thing that matters to me is what comes out of the bottle and what comes out of the bottle is a darn fine whisky  earthy smoke in the back with sweet and savory notes lasting long on the palete pulling the cork immediately brings a waft of islay shores truly a classic dram for those who can afford it  while not the brawler that my usual laphroaig is it is a wonderful alternative for those times when i feel like a waltz instead of a tango the glorious sweetness of the opening nose leads seamlessly to the gentle smokey peatiness on the pallet it may not be perfect but the belle de jour rarely is enjoy its sublime comfort  you love it or you hate it i love it absolutely love it this drink is sacred for me it 39 s outwordly  been drinking scotch for 35 years and like many of the reviewers have drank all the world class malts over the years have close to 20 bottles on my home bar at any given time some purchased as gifts some brought over scotland by business colleagues and relatives and many hand carried by myself on my frequent trips had my first experience with this two nights ago resort in florida neat with a few drops of room temp tap water one of best i 39 ve ever tasted have a case on order  i like the comments of 39 k 39 at least he is constructive and descriptive in hi summary and does instead of childish rants about meths and dettol utter rubbish there will be a difference of opinion as people have different tastes please keep it informative  first time trying an islay single malt very good has the strong smokiness like fire burning on wood also has slight fruitiness and minty aromas in the smoke smoky flavors take time to adjust when used to caramel toffee vanilla chocolate fruit butterscotch in speysides highlands lowlands and japanese whiskies would have something smoky here and there but prefer the caramel toffee vanilla chocolate fruit butterscotch tones  peaty smoke that is perfect for rainy weather  the views that say acetone or meths i concur it was bought as a present for me and a 50 a bottle i am sure glad i didn 39 t spend it on this i 39 m more a fan of pleasant single malts and bourbons penderyn madeira glenfiddich glenmorangie and the southern bourbons i find it more like meths dettol to taste my view only each to their own i mean just so complex and lovely it may be a love it or hate it product i am not sure but i can hardly imagine not having at least one bottle on the shelf  i bought this in duty free my bottle of ardbeg 10 was empty and i wanted another but alas it was not to be i was recommended this by the friendly salesman so i gave it a go now to be honest the first few times i tried it i really wasn 39 t a fan i could taste nothing but smoke and it was placed at the back of the cupboard and marked up as a poor impulse buy i cursed the salesman and went about my life 12 months later this very night in fact i find myself writing this review my 4th dram in hand and a feeling of guilt that i was so quick to judge the smokeyness is still there but there 39 s so much more behind it a warmness that takes me back to my beloved homeland a sweetness that could only be born in scotland it may not be matured in islay as a couple of people have mentioned but it is scotland in a glass strong powerful earthy with a sweetness you won 39 t find anywhere else sl 224 inte stop reducing the quality of good malts diageo stop chill filtering your malts don 39 t you get it make money by selling products that scream quality and not watered down inferior malts you can only fool the new drinker who has never tried a non chill filtered natural colour malt  however much i would like to try lagavulin 16 i would not for two reasons a lagavulin is not matured in islay lagavulin as well as caol ila and talisker are transported across the scottish waters in stainless steel vats to the mainland where they are matured with other whiskies therefore lagavulin caol ila and talisker have absolutely no sign of the geography of islay in their maturity this makes a substantial impact on the flavour of the whisky and i care about that impact because lagavulin costs quite a lot of money that said caol ila 12 and talisker 10 are affordable so the damage is not as steepb the reasons stated above are acceptable if and only if diageo stops chill filtering and colouring lagavulin 16 for the price point and owing to the fact that it is not matured in islay they ought to stop chill filtering and adding artificial colour only then would lagavulin 16 be worth its price therefore at the current situation it is a rip off chill filtration of single malts takes away a big portion of the flavour of the whisky and that is what we are paying for the flavour not the brand and no one wants a mediocre product at an inflated price point anyone can test my claim try any two single malts side by side one chill filtered and the other non chill filtered and you will know the difference is worth ranting over as long as we keep turning a blind eye towards these big corporations by playing into their marketing gimmicks and the many useless and overrated whisky awards we will never get our money 39 s worth  i had this for the first time last night after returning from my trip to scotland where i decided peat is definitely my preferred taste i describe this as having a smoky fireplace in my chest i 39 m a 5 39 3 petite blonde and loved the experience can 39 t wait to have it again  not the pleasant palate test after i consumed this whiskey it 39 s really not what i expected from it i prefer something better like oban macallan or similar much better then this junk  simply the best for those who like glenlivet and glenfidich and other easy drinking speyside scotches move on this is islay baby peat smoke brine sweet and fresh fruit with a hint of iodine to finish you off clearly a scotch for whom a discerning palate is a prerequisite slangiva  initially the smokey seemed a bit overpowering but after it opened up a bit this scotch became incredibly well balanced while still retaining the classic islay profile i find myself daydreaming of my next glass a little unsettling but what are you gonna do  mouthwatering phenolic sweetness with smokey overtones hints of spice and fresh fruit soaked in sour dough and nutty chocolate my oh my  after 40 years drinking johnny black i decided to try something else when i got my dream job i decided to celebrate with a bottle of lagavulin 16 in my local abc store that cost 100 so i expected to not be disappointed i was disappointed while it was undoubtedly smooth and full flavored the smokey seemed overdone sort of liquid smoke mixed with an ashtray perhaps it is a lack of taste on my part but i think the glenlivet 15 in french oak casks was far better and cost 1 3 less  for a 15 plus year aged scotch i expect a smoother experience but this scotch was lesser smooth than a 5 year bottom shelf yes the bouquet is promising and the first second on the front gives you hope but then it becomes a petulant toddler throwing a temper tantrum save yourself the trouble and try something like glenfiddich 18 or glenlivet 20  like another said let it sit in your mouth for a while and swallow slowly this is an incredible whisky just delicious  best quot hillbilly quot i ever had my own recipe 2 parts lagavulin 16 and 1 part drambuie on the rocks  the embodiment of islay expectation you had better like it smokey great mouth coating flavour quite pungent to begin with but small sips amp drunk slowly make this a satisfying and moreish whisky  i 39 m enjoying lagavulin 16 for the first time right now and this was a good call it won 39 t be the last time  smoke smoke and smoke as i 39 m learning my way through scotch world i 39 m learning nose is absolute smoke very reminiscent of southern barbecue on the pallet is a roundhouse of tastes finished with a sting of alcohol and more smoke this whiskey feels like it is meant for unapologetic carnivores big and in your face not for quot gentle folk quot i 39 ve never diluted a whiskey in my life and i won 39 t start with this one if i were to settle in with a bottle for a long night i 39 d probably want a salty snack of some sort to nibble as i sipped to keep everything balanced  intense taste for sure i 39 m more of a bourbon guy but had to try this out there was a depth of flavor here i wasn 39 t used to as well as flavors and smells that were familiar but i couldn 39 t quite place this is something that i would recommend someone to at least enjoy once  tasted it for first time tonight delightful sitting next to my bonnie wee bonnie lassie norma joan in southern california  nose initially reminded me a lot of talisker dark storm but not as intense and rough more complex smoother and less aggressive on the nose peaty smoke iodine and salt like the sea a deep sweetness like malt mouth oily rich and thick flavours similar to the smell coat the mouth smoke some peat saltiness iodine and material from the sea met with some dark sherry or dark fruits sweetness with a malt like sweetness a tiny hint of oak finish like how your hair smells after an entire day at the beach and some smoke oily and lingers for a long while would recommend to those who like their peaty smokey whiskeys and i think it is definitely worth a try for everyone though i understand it may be a love it or hate it scenario i think you should try it before you cross it off your list a masterpiece of whiskey  well if you 39 re psychotic man who loves to waste 40 for drinking betadine then don 39 t hesitate go for this one i 39 m sure you will be utterly satisfied cheers x the best whisky in the world i 39 ve tried plenty of smoky islay malts at this stage in life and nothing comes close as for speyside orkney et al they are are just lame in comparison to anything from islay i wish i could afford to have a bottle permanently on the go  the best whisky in the world i 39 ve tried plenty of smoky islay malts at this stage in life and nothing comes close  as an amateur to single malts i was unsure what to expect if you 39 re new to it the first scent and sip will slap you around and take you off your feet give it time have a glass the next night glencairn if you have it it 39 s been a few nights i 39 ve enjoyed it very slowly it 39 s amazing i can 39 t describe the beautiful leathery feeling and taste expensive but worth it  tastes like someone has set fire to a toffee factory using wrights coal tar vaporisers amazing  mitico mitico il mio preferito questo lagavulin 16 anni 232 veramente un grande whisky una profondit 224 di sapori speziati ma sempre equilibrati tra loro al palato pungente al punto giusto un whisky da serata con un bel trancio di salmone in crosta di patate  beautiful rich smoky a subtle sweetness with some spices and vanilla close your eyes and be transported next to a bonfire on a cold scottish beach with the salty wind blowing in your face i may just have found a new favorite dram  you must try it i read before that this is a love it or leave it whisky some people hate i don 39 t get it is breath taking i can 39 t stop drinking it it is really rich yes there is a lot of pest but it 39 s not just that it 39 s rich and sweet very sweet and dry it is completely different from all the other drams ive tasted before wonderful  sipping the lagavulin 16 my wife picked up for me for father 39 s day this stuff is nectar of the ghods very nice body lush mouthfeel and with decently complex flavors 43 alcohol it is from the islay region home of some of the most famous scotch made nose smoke vanilla sweet spices touch of sherry alcohol is muted barely there palate thick and rich sherry and sweet fruit and of course that smoke delectable smoke not slap the face but muted strength if that makes sense the finish is long and wonderful with the smoke drifting off and a reminder that yes this is a whisky something one can almost forget overall this is a very nice scotch one that exemplifies what some age can accomplish with an islay it is luxurious smooth smokey with a reminder of sherry i highly recommend it and thank my babydoll for picking it up for me  wow caught me off guard  while driving in france i met an old friend in the food drinks industry he handed over his wee flask and i had a sip silly me i should have glugged it he gave me the name lagavulin and when i returned home i bought my first bottle i drink speyside whiskies in all their variety but lagavulin 16 is the one i empty fastest  such a good scotch i 39 m not really good at tasting note so i won 39 t go there but i 39 m truly amazed by this juice as the title says i could drink this every day those of you who say it is aweful probably a bad batch i gifted a bottle of this to my brother in law and it 39 s nowhere near as good as the bottle i own 100 would buy again  i am stunned at some of the poor comments on here from others this is a gorgeous whisky one that i would happily drink until i pass off this mortal coil  funny to read the moronic views of posters here who obviously have a palate on a similar level to their iq 39 s stunning dram a privilege to drink such a perfectly crafted malt few finer drinks on the planet including the best bordeaux wines etc gorgeous  absolutely disgusting tasted like turpentine going to cross this off my list and go back to macallan glenmorangie highland park and my dalmore truly disgusting tasted like acetone  i love this whisky i have and continue to try new whiskies every month but so far none compare to this  find the peat too much for my liking when first opened did something crazy by matching it with red chillies and the quot enlightenment quot moment happens still rich and smoky on palate in fact with added spiciness but the finishing is superb with hint of herbs amidst the oaky sweetness and i proceed to finish half a bottle that says it all  hello i 39 m the sugarbear i 39 ve reviewed many whiskies on this website mainly scotch since it 39 s the superior and i am starting to run out of things to try i am lucky enough to get this for 55 a bottle here in california even though it is typically between 75 and 100 at most stores it is always in my collection and i 39 m finishing off my tenth bottle right now with number eleven on standby this might be the perfect age for an islay whisky if it were younger it would be peatier but not as smooth n oaky 8 year totally awesome and if it were older it wouldn 39 t be peaty enough honestly it 39 s consistently amazing i truly love this whisky and i have to have it on hand at all times to whoever poured this down the drain if you bought it you can do what you want with it but i hate you and to those who gave it a low rating you probably don 39 t enjoy bold complex flavors which is fine but you are boring to whoever said that this is so good it brings tears to their eyes i completely agree with and to you i say cheers slainte the sugarbear see title  it 39 s good not great nice nose mouth feel is thin and finish is med short  best single malt i 39 ve ever had add 2 fingers of italian sparkling water and let sit for 5 mins very very good  my first was bottle was in 2006 it immediately became my favourite and it still is in 2017 and for the price it is simply outstanding  long story but eventually discovered the islay brands basic inventory includes a coup le of laphroaigs 10yr and cask ardbeg uigeadail and laguvalin 16 plus dalwhinnie for guests who think highland scotch is the real thing ok i 39 ve also got some chivas for cretins who want it with ice ir god forbid soda even had one person ask for scitch and milk but the laguvalin is my favorite toss in a drop or two of water died and gone to heaven just touch it to your lips and let it spread across your taste buds i truly cannot understand anyone who can drink anything else this is without a doubt the finest scotch made back in the bi era before islay i was nearly apoplectic after finishing a bottle of 25 year old mccallan but the laguvalin changed all that put it on your bucket list but put it at the top you won 39 t regret it  i actually gasped when i read a review a few under my one that said they poured it down the drain what a waste this was the first whisky to truly get me hooked my partner bought it for me on a whim for my birthday one year on that gesture alone i should propose to her what an absolute belter of a dram like drinking a bush fire so smoky and complex i always have a bottle on hand you should too  i dont find this as peaty as laphroaig but a fine dram  one of the best there is cant go wrong with this one but not during after a dinner the taste also improvs over time wait a week or so after you opened it  hated it at first very smoky and errr but wait after after a few weeks you might like it seriously it takes time to get use to the taste and once you do you will love it too  i 39 ve heard great things about the 16 and so for my birthday my brother inlaw another scotch drinker brought me a bottle we cracked it open and couldn 39 t wait to enjoy it but when we took our first drink neat it had the taste and smell of campho phenique so we waited about 30 minutes to give out taste buds a chance to change but it was the same we drink all brands and types of scotch but nothing like this so down the drain it went just like our plans  i 39 ll always remember my first experience of lagavulin 16 blew me away truly sadly the last two bottles i 39 ve purchased have been a real disappointment they have seemed much more one dimensional than the first bottle and somewhat fragile when adding water maybe my palate has moved on who knows still not a bad whisky just below its historical par at present i might wait 5 years before buying another lg16 i would recommend laphroaig 39 s triple wood amp old ballantruan peated malt as worthy present day replacements  i don 39 t typically rate scotches just like a painting a sculpture or even a fine cigar the ratings is based on what we perceive and not the artistery of the creator as another comentor below mentioned lagavulin and talisker are two of the finest representations of great single malt scotches i would add for those who enjoy the unique characteristics of each lagavulin 16 is truly a masterful work of art even if it isn 39 t your palate appreciate the artistery in crafting  been trying various malts just turned 69 years old getting a good taste for whisky really liked this 16 yr lagavulin will definately buy it taste is supreme tks a citrus tang drifts in and out of a huge cloud of smoke all on a bed of silky luxurious malt brine and seaweed fade into a finish that goes on and on one dram of lagavulin and the 90 price tag feels like a bargain  smoky sweet for sure great taste and fantastic finish  this is my whisky what an incredible rich taste  the cognac of whiskies amazing smoky sweet flavor as described a little bite on the back end but very tasty  this is only my second bottle of scotch just opened two evenings ago first bottle was balvenie double wood 12 i have to say that i really like it there is not as much smoke as i thought i had tried a laphroig at a friends place and found it showed much more smoke with not much else coming through i 39 m very new to this in contrast the lagavulin had smoke at the start but also the sweetness of the sherry came through i much prefer the lagavulin my favourite dram of all those i have tasted so far  i m buying more  the negative reviews are hilarious easily the best everyday whisky nothing comes close this is a very special drink lagavulin 16 is my second favorite scotch that is below the 100 mark in the states 1 lagavulin 12 3 ardbeg 10 fantastic stuff  not for the novice scotch drinker a must for every scotch cabinet campfire in a glass definitely the smokiest dram you will ever have don 39 t start with this in a scotch life or evening but finish with it  my most favorite single malt tremendous character really tastes like whisky  this was the first islay malt that i loved and remains the whisky that i love the most i 39 m nothing close to a peat head as my next three favorites are all highlands for perspective highland park glenmorangie balvenie aside from ardbeg auriverdes limited rare and somewhat overpowering this one is more pronounced than i can imagine a whisky being without being offensive to someone not accustomed to islay peat it 39 s much less phenolic than laphroaig and ardbeg and yet still the smoke is pronounced enough without smelling like an old gym shoe on fire this whisky is incredible and will perhaps remain my absolute favorite indefinitely before trying this or any islay malt i 39 d recommend the highland park 12 or 15 if you can find it first theirs is a nice stepping stone to the smokiness that this one provides  great smoke one of my favorites especially the long after taste genuine whiskey  some hype sorry but this is horrible  the emperors new clothes taste like a smokey bandage nasty after taste will not die worst scotch i 39 ve ever had  the best single malt scotch i 39 ve ever tasted new to the world of scotch lagavulin has become one of my favorites scotch being an acquired taste i am glad i have matured  i bought a bottle of laphroaig quarter cask 2 years ago tried it finished it it was too much like a 5 grocery store cheesecake big and thick and unrefined saw lagavulin 16 on sale so thought maybe i should give islay another try folks this one is the real deal if laphroaig quarter cask is corner bakery then lagavulin 16 is a high tea  you say iodine i say shoe polish 10 10 would drink again the more u drink the more u enjoy  i have first tasted it in wien austria in a whiskey pub the best smokey one i have tried definetly in my own collection always such a smokey and at the same time such gentle wow excellent has been my favorite since the beginning just an amazing dram  got bought a bottle if this for my 30th birthday was not disappointed lovely smokey peaty whisky can 39 t see this bottle lasting me long got a bottle for christmas my son and i enjoyed it greatly we will savor the jewel for months to come excellent i sent this as a gift and the recipient was very pleased thank you for a pleasant shopping experience and a great product at a fair price  rather overwhelming peat smoke and tcp intense for sure probably an acquired taste though  love this bottle got it for christmas and boy what a great taste the smokiness hit me as soon as i pulled the cork and what a great aroma the first taste was like heaven the smokiness reminded me of a pipe tobacco and the sweetness rounded out the flavour this scotch goes down so smooth and warms the soul  a lovely whisky for those who have a mature palate you need to take a good swig and allow it to sit in the mouth for the flavours to burst out first time i tried it it brought a tear to my eye its not to everyone 39 s taste though you either love islay whiskies or you don 39 t inexperienced palates beware  a great sipping whisky smoke and pest and smell of the sea unique and unforgettable  i 180 ve drunk many a good single malt of any age and this chemical tasting dram was the worst 45 euro down the drain  one of my faves this and talisker are some of the finest examples of single malts i have tried my taste leans towards the west as highlands and speysides can be a bit too sweet for me lagavulin was the first islay i tasted and remains one of the best for me i think the negative reviews are from those who sip you just can 39 t do that with an islay hold a mouthful on your tongue and savour it wait the let it slide down your throat smooth intensely warm and sensual massive flavour which opens up as you swallow it i find if you drink it slowly you get less iodine and more warm smoky richness if it tastes thin then you are sipping it or drinking too fast no good drink tastes good sipped lagavuin 16 is not just a drink it 39 s an experience  one of the first whiskies i ever tried in the drawing room of an old castle and it completely converted me incredible complexity and very peaty gorgeous for a cold winter 39 s night  hello peatness my old friend there is much speculation and debate about who is the peat master in southern islay i confess that for me ardbeg is most often like making out with a barbecue one of ardbeg 39 s expressions is the only single malt i 39 d ever consider embellishing with added ice seriously so lagavulin and laphroig honestly i go both ways having tasted a 42 year old barrel of lagavulin on site i became a true believer though i can 39 t give up my square foot of laphroig peat bog the 16 year old is an accessible standard bearer for islay and peat definitely there a wee bit in the nose more on the palate the memory in the finish for me it is how lagavulin marries the peat with the sea the nose has that great salinity that reminds you that you are not only on an island but one that is off the coast of another island the finish is all peat and seaweed for me i 39 d recommend picking up a bottle making the drive and walk to the american memorial at the mull of oa looking for the ubiquitous rain clouds between scotland and northern ireland and raising one to those who have died at sea this dram is a worthy honour to those souls  i 39 m really stunned at how much i dislike this whisky i 39 m not normally a peat fan and prefer speyside but i do appreciate the likes of laphroaig 10 and ardbeg uigeadail for me this doesn 39 t taste or smell of peat smoke it tastes of cigarette ash and an unpleasant medicinal flavour  top of the islay league but ardbeg 10 yo is pretty close  i purchased this month a bottle of lagavulin islay single malt scotch whisky 16 years after about 15 years i remember a great whisky peaty full and pleasant taste this seems a standard quality whiskies which was added an aroma of poor quality smoke leaves an unpleasant aftertaste  stunning the top cat of peaty malts should be on everyone 39 s christmas list  wonderful stuff south africa loves it very smooth no headache in the morning need i say more i dnt think so peat and a little sweet nose is campfire and perfume gritty yet colorful my all time favorite  at first i wasn 39 t quite sure that i wasn 39 t to like this the smell is distinct and the whisky is clearly and uncompromisingly peaty however after finishing off the bottle much quicker than expected i was fully convinced that this is a brilliant scotch  just purchased a bottle from costco nr chester really looking forward to opening this later near christmas time this is my first bottle after reading the reviews i would like to visit islay to see how the whisky is made i personally favor lowland and islay scotch especially i tried lagavulin 16 for the first time and it was an epiphany of the entire soul of scotch the peat is massive and undeniable certainly not for the weaker palate but it is so rich and complex beyond that i was simply floored at the beauty of this drink 3 ounces 2 cubes  good peated whisky  one word excellent  lagavulin 16 is the scotch drinkers think of when it comes y islay scotch great peaty smokey flavor one of my standard scotches  the best value whiskey i 39 ve ever had  very nice i think watery feeling some reviewers comment on is actually the dryness of the dram it doesn 39 t have the iodine hit of the 12yo cask strength but wait awhile and you 39 ll get a subtle hint very pleasing dram  wonderful taste thick and rich taste is unmistakable a bit to intense smokey for my palate review flavor profile is very accurate i didn 39 t get as much peat as intense smoke  i believe this is a love it or hate it scotch if you like smoke and peat this is the one there is a wonderful brine and salt finish with a hint of vanilla and coffee tastes differ but this is my all time favourite scotch but at 125 per bottle in canada i don 39 t drink it very often  as someone who appreciates 39 smoother warmer 39 scotch eg glenlivet distiller 39 s reserve i 39 m having a hard time adjusting to the extreme peat smoke and weird mix of dry with subtle sweet notes can 39 t say this is a favourite  wonderful whisky and good value i discovered this marvelous whisky when the waiter brought this instead of the one i 39 d ordered never have i been so happy with a mistake i have shared this with friends after supper in celebration and in commiseration i have sipped this rich smoky full bodied mix of peat barley and the distiller 39 s magic alchemy around campfires watching for meteors and getting philosophical the aroma of wood smoke evokes fond memories of this magnificent dram  wow gorgeous my son bought my first personal bottle of lagavulin 16 for my 60th birthday a treat for certain not being at all acquainted with the nuances and complexities of a finer bottle of scotch whisky i was at first somewhat overwhelmed by the taste of smoke and peat mixed with something i might almost refer to as antiseptic or medicinal my son recommended i hold a mouthful in for about ten seconds then slowly as possible begin the swallowing process as i began to do so i experienced after about 8 seconds or so a near explosion of flavors quite unlike the peat moss taste that had been at the forefront of my initial go at it a woodsy flavour one accompanied quite nicely with a tad of decent sherry became quite pronounced i am even as i write this review enjoying a two finger splash of the whisky over two cubes of ice perfect for what ails ya cheers  perfection from my perspective the best balance between sweetness smokiness and earthiness  well this has been my first 39 disappointment 39 as a whisky sadly my bottle anyways is not what i would describe as rich or thick it 39 s quite thin and does not stand up to any water being added and i mean a drop it is very sweet and smoky though with lovely licorice and ginger bread notes and a nice smoky tea bag finish not unpleasant by any means but was not what i expected given reviews and tasting notes i have come across have to say that the 16 years have definitely created an easy drinking spirit that does indeed have 39 the fire taken out 39 possibly a bad batch or tired casks my lowest rating given i don 39 t feel that for the price i was getting the quality that say for 163 2 3 extra i would have got from an uigeadail maybe i had too high expectations but i 39 ve had better whiskys for much less 46 and ncf would also help  opening this bottle and taking a sniff you get a hint of formaldehyde and antiseptic when you try to drink it it gets worse the formaldehyde flavor over powers everything but the dirt and the finish is a mix of sawdust and iodine  there will always be mixed reviews when it comes to singles this 16yr old is one of my favorites peaty and smoky on top of peat and smoke might be too much for some people but if you like earthy scotches this is king more flavor then you can imagine and yet it remained smooth and creamy a must try for everyone  first taste i wasn 39 t too taken the next night i added a few drops of tap water and it was transformed into the best whisky i have ever tasted love it while some you more quot refined quot connoisseurs may appreciate this gut rot this particular distillation curled up my taste buds a friend described it as quot earthy quot i replied quot no i think you mean middle earthy you know like aged in an orc 39 s a quot anyways if you enjoy this then more power to you i 39 m pretty sure its also sauron 39 s favorite i could 39 ve saved 80 and chewed on my hiking boot after trudging them through a boggy swamp oi oi oi this is the peatiest smokiest dram i have ever had the displeasure of consuming it 39 s like drinking old shoes that have been in a fire  my first taste of a peaty scotch was laphoaig quarter cask at first it was odd an acquired taste for sure but it grew on me and the more it mellowed the better it became so i bought a highland park 12 and at first i thought there was nothing special aside from the smoke but it quickly settled down a bit after opening and it was a great experience since then i 39 ve had other peaty scotches like laph 18 amp talisker i had read and seen many reviews on lagavulin 16 too many great reviews to ignore it i ordered some in a pub on vacation tasted great from the first sip smoky flavorful and balanced i the tried it again at a friends house and i decided to buy my own so i went to my local shop and finally brought it home i open the bottle and take a sniff and nothing thought that was odd i pour a small dram into my glencairn glass and still a faint smell with not much smoke now i taste it and i 39 m stunned sweet smooth sweet again with a little bit of smoke what happened to this it tastes weak and mellowed out like almost a drink left out over night what a waste of 90 i contacted lagavulin and i 39 m still waiting to hear from a quality control rep i know what it 39 s supposed to taste like but at its price i will not be willing to roll the dice and hope to get a quot good batch quot in the future my first real disappointment in single malts as i have tried many what a shame  reminds me of the old coal miners sweets very smokey tastes of vanilla and peat aswell dandilion and burdock almost in a way one of the best islay available one to try at least once in your life absolutely perfect this is the whiskey this got me into collecting to begin with i 39 ve had 300 whiskies including many over 200 600 and worlds best whiskies but this one always holds a special place in my palate it 39 s just perfect in every way 10 10 the best so far i have had 150 different scotches in the last several years this is one of my favorites it is the perfect blend of peat and sherry  nectar of the gods  thick rich smooth a definite addition to the stable  standing in the whiskey section new to the whole scottish whiskey thing besides reading a review or two and loving me some glenmorangie a woman walks up and asks me if i had tried laphroaig i told her no and that i had only read in review that it was good she then pointed out to me lagavulin and told me how her friends loved it so much and only drank lagavulin but that she wanted to get something new to try though i was of no help to her she helped me a great deal and i snatched up lagavulin as my first islay purchase and my god was it a great purchase being a glenmorangie higland whiskey fan boy i obviously love me so full bodied rich and sweet whiskey but lagavulin has shown me why it is everyone loves islay scottish whiskey so much it is basically the complete opposite of a highland yet i crave it throughout the day such an amazing whiskey and one that from now on will always have a place on my shelf  love taste of isle of islay love this stuff always have it on hand  this amazing scotch whiskey is really a gods gift and if you haven 39 t tried it you haven 39 t lived literally amazing always a treat  this used to be something spectacular a unique earthly delight now it 39 s more run of the mill what the hell happened i miss the bombast and experience of the old lagavulin this literally tastes watered down i don 39 t know if that violates a law in the uk for the production of spirits but whatever this is violates my soul and leaves me wanting i hate to say it but i will not buy this again  tastes watered down is this the same thing as before where is the flavor wasted my money on this not a bad scotch as it is but hardly a 1st place winner  best scotch i 39 ve tried to date mmmmm so sweet and smooth  so god damn smooth beautifully matured to deliver a very pleasant experience to all and i mean all of drinking a healthy west coast malt slainte to all  the smokiness of this scotch is akin to a campfire this has quickly become my favorite scotch if you are not sure about purchasing this liquid gold curb this doubt and make it a priority to obtain it  great whisky reminds me a lot of bacon very salty and full but not in an oily way reminds me of long fishing days on the beach by the campfire   maltmondaysthe nose remarkably complex theres refined natural smoke amp peat balanced with true sweetness its not a light sherry sweetness but a heavy rich honey like sweetness as expected from an islay the sea is roaring in the glass blackened drying seaweed as well fresh life giving sea algae jump to the top of your sinuses the taste salt returns the smokiness is more subdued in the taste then the nose the sweetness is now wrapped in oak textures this is a real mouthful full bodied and challenging buttery figs amp dates add a winter character to the taste the finish long and engaging the thick nature of the smoke wraps itself around your tongue hence the kraken reference salty tenticles from the deep blue sea engulf your tongue much like the ancient imagery of the kraken or early interpretations of remarkable but very real giant squid and octopus both a great food pairing the lingering taste continues warm amp subtly sweet the last note being a oddly sweet brine like bitterness  for my money this is simply the best whisky in the world for under 100 perhaps the best period most readily carachterized by intense smoke peat iodine and sea spray it smells and tastes like a campfire on a beach pure ambrosia  i had wanted to try lagavulin for almost 20 years honestly the 100 price made me nervous when i got my dream job cio of a hospital i decided to treat myself however i checked here and it seemed the 15 year old glenlevit in french oak kegs rated slightly higher at 2 3s the price last month i turned 60 and bought the lagavulin it is the smoothest single malt i ever tasted however i won 39 t buy it again i suppose my palate is not sophistcated enough but it tasted like someone took the words smoothest whiskey and then poured in half a bottle of liquid smoke i think it gave me heartburn the peat is a little strong too bit it 39 s the smoke that ruined it for me as i say its likely my lack of sophistication at least it did not set off the smoke detectors  i finally got my hands on this and opened it up last weekend the nose is very very concentrated almost overpowering everything else with the seaweed iodine flavors but wait a definite whiff of vanilla sweetness emerges the palate is more raw seaside than other great islays has an edgier feel more briny seaweed y then the smooth sweetness takes over with the peat lurking in the background a hint of meat the finish is spicy smoky aaah if on a winter 39 s night a traveler walked in tired and weary put his feet up beside a fire and savored a dram compared to the ardberg 10 this is more quot wild ocean quot the 10 is sweeter fruitier if you will compared to the ugi the ugi is more quicksilver with all the coffee cocoa and brown sugar notes this seems to be the perfect balance between a laph 10 which i find unrefined beyond a point sorry and the ardberg 10 4 5 solid stars very balanced smokey leathery sweetness i 39 ve never tasted anything like this  a perfectly balanced single malt smooth and has a great finish so glad someone recommended it getting hooked  nose smoke sweetness dry peat mature amp very complextaste oak salt small sweetness full rich butter datesfinish long full of ripeness and smokenot a beginners peated whisky in my opinion a great taster for the experience drinker  when god finally finished creating the heavens and the earth on the 7 th day on the 8th day he opened a bottle of lagavulin to celebrate what he achieved  it 39 s like the best cuban cigar in a bottle superb  complex stormy flavors where oaken ships sweet with exotic fruit role on crests of smoky waves for what seems an eternity if you only drink one bottle scotch in a lifetime let it be this one  this is an amazing creation it 39 s like drinking peat and fire  cannot go wrong with this a benchmark for peaty single malt whiskies  bought this bottle on a lark and the first time i tried it i thought it was awful then the next day something said i should try it again that has been happening now to the point i am going to have to order another bottle i definitely wouldn 39 t have liked it a year ago but as my tastes have matured so has my love for this scotch  a complex peaty whiskey which is the one i drink most frequently even though i have several other isaly whiskies in my cabinet  lagavulin was recommended to me by a waiter in cefalu sicily i am now obsessed with the smoky rich bite  the best of everything in one dram where has the smoke gone its not the dream it was two years ago let alone ten shame on you diageo i was lucky enough to get about a triple measure for just a few euros in italy today i don 39 t think the barmaid knew what she was pouring full of flavour with plenty of smokiness it seemed perfect in the warm weather but i can imagine this being great on a cold night in i would highly recommend a bottle of this sophisticated scotch and will definitely buy one myself  this won 39 t just put hairs on your chest it 39 ll make your god damn balls drop superb islay  sophisticated flavor my favorite whiskey starts well decent smoke without the tcp of younger cruder islay 39 s middle is full and fruity read any of the reviews below and the finish goes on for some time in the same fashion many folk will like this whisky for it 39 s simple macho smoke and look for nothing more especially at this price reason for only 6 10 is that overall it really lacks complexity or interest despite the smoke its a bland commercial product delivering little development or evolution in the glass i look for more in a whisky especially at 16 y o most exquisite scotch whiskey ever made  just right smoke with fabulous finish and deep aroma without overwhelming the nose or palate i 39 m a bit of a newbie to the whisky appreciation scene so i 39 m always willing to find my new favourite i love talisker and singleton also very partial to laphroaig for me lagavulin took the best parts of these 3 and created a taste explosion i may well have found my new favourite it 39 s not what this whisky is underneath but what it does that defines it  the finest excellent islay single malt  best how come such an exotic alcohol has such a repulsive smell  i recently brought a bottle of l16 to a poker game with friends they are not experienced scotch drinkers and there were many different liquors available but the entire bottle quickly went down their throats with gusto and approbation always a pleasure to expose new scotch drinkers to this fine islay this one will always be one of my favorites  excellent scotch i 39 ve drank many many different labels from both islay and the highlands and this one is superb the richness and concentration are outstanding  incredible proper whisky for grown ups  it is a wonderful malt  i 39 m a long term islay fan and have been nursing a bottle bought at norwegian prices suffice to say when i managed to cork it the remainder ended up in a plastic water bottle am now hiding the evidence and enjoying the mellower sherry vanilla toffee notes with the usual after kick for me best enjoyed neat in what appears to be a stemless cognac glass  amazing malt truly is second best in islay behind ardbeg corryvreckan  islay beauty it is no words thank you lord  the best islay whisky there is  its frigging good you will love it only if you know what whiskey is smoke peat sherry i swear to you guys i had a glass of that monster and walked 15 minutes from my hotel to the mall and still the finish is lingering look if you are one of these guys quot whiskey coke whiskey soda quot better to avoid it because lagavulin will kick your arse this is real men drink not suitable for youngsters it 39 s dangerous  an islay lover i never cared for this one annoyed that everyone else adores it i kept trying rotten mushrooms i kept tasting everything else was quot okay quot but couldn 39 t get over the rotten mushrooms three bottles over two years and finally i get it for me the secret do 50 50 water or more i 39 m generally not a water adder did i just say that even to e g a 39 bunadh but some water really brings this one out for me kills that concentrated rotten mushroom essence and opens up whole new layers of complexity the other islays corryvreckan notwithstanding don 39 t take water nearly as well and in retrospect that says something there 39 s much more to this than smoke   201 o melhot single malt j 225 tenho o costume de toma lo no momento estou degustando esrs maravilha sempre que viajo compro 2 garrafas esta terminando e preciso comprar mais minha nota 233 100  avid gin drinker who was convinced to get a new perspective on scotch lagavulin 16 is a fantastic place to start head and shoulders above the others i 39 ve tried thus far had as much fun smelling this as i did drinking it  nectar of the gods  delicious earthy peaty smokey a flavour that lingers and sweetens as it subdues an acquired taste very unique  definitely an acquired taste not for anyone new to the game peaty and medicinal but a well balanced single malt for the experienced single malt drinker great finish  for me it just doesnt get better than this rich smoky complex perfectly balanced head and shoulders above any other single malt i have tried just magnificent  this beautiful rich whiskey has a power to entice you it 39 s rich deep with a long finish pitty but not overly so with a beautiful hue of polish amber  huge smokey nose and taste  i love talisker and this whisky beats it i 39 m a mckinnon so that hurts  while some may consider laphroaig 10 almost medicinal lagavulin 16 has the peat and iodine of laphroaig nicely balanced with the smooth complex smoky nature of a 25 year old from the mccallan a longtime favorite of mine and many of my friends amongst commercially available single malts  been taking the scottish medicine for quite a few years now lagavulin is the very best value by far to get any better you need to spend 163 100 39 s add a little water tiny drop to break it up and it is transformed into a smooth delightful dram not gonna get ponsy about hint of this etc is down to your tongue if you are new to malt maybe start on a lowland light fruity number before moving onto the speys and islays malt its not business its personal enjoy  the first scotch my wife enjoyed great with my steak or after the meal wonderfully smooth  this is by far my favourite whisky that i have tasted to now a complex and smooth drink that i cannot help but return to masters the note of smoke which in my opinion can often be overdone and so can be enjoyed by a larger audience i will continue to purchase this and i recommend to anyone quot on the fence quot to go for it you won 39 t be disappointed  simply being scottish certainly doesn 39 t make me the last word on scotch plus all tasters enjoy differing palates however i know what i enjoy and when a flavour excites me such was not fully the case with lagavulin however i would be amiss if i were not to mention that 39 spilling 39 2 shots into a nearly full 5th of glenlivet 12 a gift from someone who apparently does not know scotch created a very enjoyable 5th of quot glenlagalivet quot i hope by now you 39 re chuckling but please know this is a true story and the moral is if the laguvulin is that redeeming in a mostly full 5th of glenlivet 12 then perhaps you should try it smooth is the operative word when i begin to describe my experience of enjoying my first tasting of the lagavulin oh i must also mention i do not particularly enjoy a heavily smoky scotch hence i may be somewhat negatively bias herewith still an honest 4 5 stars for the lagavulin an uncanny smoothness  i 39 ve tried over 10 different scotches just started drinking scotch and i must say that this is a mans drink i want a steak with every sip it 39 s smooth powerful and very tasty i feel more like ron swanson with every glass  i 39 ve tried over 10 different scotches just started drinking scotch and i must say that this is a mans drink i want a steak with every sip it 39 s smooth powerful and very tasty i feel more like ron swanson with every glass  so guys my original thought was that this reminiscent of mezcal no this was entirely wrong this is supreme and excellently balanced this is just a good scotch whisky  if you fancy angels piss then this is the bottle for you savor every last drop and then go buy more  i don 39 t understand how any scotch drinker can 39 t like this i 39 ve had multiple bottles over the years and have enjoyed them all i have tried many other scotch whiskys but this is the one i always have in my pantry  a deep west peaty whisky my favorite  i hate to share i love this single malt to the core it 39 s smoothit 39 s smokyit 39 s satisfyingit 39 s excitingit 39 s a wow my favorite all time whiskey  this is my first time trying your scotch i had it after a nice meal at a restaurant and decided to try it asked if it was better neat or neat with water and was told to try both ways definitely better with a dash of water the vanilla and spices come through the nose and the palate is superb i may have to invest in a bottle cheers  this is an excellently balanced tipple not the crazed unbalanced madness of laphroaig or the mezcal notes of arbeg this is smooth and easy going  this is great not the best islay but still tasty  from the powerful aroma the taste leaves nothing to the imagination of this scotch if you like to excite the senses in a little delicate way this is your drink however i do not recommend it for those who like delicate and mild flavors  this is possibly my favourite whisky as soon as i 39 ve finished a bottle i replenish it it 39 s an utterly unique and original dram and i can 39 t think of anything else like it as the description says it really is a full mouth flavour ash smoke and peat followed by vanilla almost slightly salted this certainly isn 39 t a dram i 39 d give to mates of mine who are just starting to try whisky but i 39 ve recommended it to those who are interested in something big and beautiful if you 39 re put off by peat then i 39 d recommend trying a sample either from this site or buying a dram in a bar just in case it 39 s not for you each to their own after all  every time i try any other whiskey i find myself comparing them to this and so far without question no other really compares or makes me smile the way this one does there 39 s just something about it  truly a masterpiece and its affordable  love it 96 out off 100 so glad i bought a bottle of this i ve had very cheap and very expensive scotch before served by people who make over a million dollars a year and this lag 16 brings your senses to life people seem to love it or hate it having never had a strong islay before the initial nose and taste shocked me but was never harsh always smooth after a couple sips i really started liking it and experiencing all the nuances  usually i buy a bottle of lagavulin 16 once a year and drink it within a few weeks or so in the meantime i try all kinds of other whisky and whiskey from all kinds of continents though mainly from scotland i have to admit but the point is every time i buy that bottle of lag 16 i open the bottle drink almost a 3rd of it within the first night and find myself asking why buy anything else there was a period when i kind of resented or felt sinful about this whisky because of its added color but in the end i just gave in to the perfection on the palate i 39 m being honest to myself i enjoy drinking this whisky a lot and i can still say without any shame or whatsoever lagavulin 16 still is my favourite whisky for enjoyment and there 39 s nothing i can do about it  one of the most complex whiskys you 39 ll find tasting notes here are spot on anyone here that finds it at all disagreeable or sub par can send their partially used bottle directly to me free of charge  i wish i took the time to read the reviews before i dropped 90 on a bottle the first thing i noticed was it smelled very strongly of plastic and formaldehyde and to no surprise that 39 s exactly how it tasted i let it air in the glass for a while and still tastes as bad as the first sip as it sat next to me my girl complains that it stunk terribly of cigarettes every time she walked past i truly wonder if it 39 s my pallet that doesn 39 t agree with it as another has comment or if it 39 s a bad batch or bottle my guess is it 39 s my pallet because although my girl and i both hated the smell we differed greatly as to what that it 39 s smelt like i will say although it is the worst scotch i 39 ve ever tasted it was one of the smoothest  like a lot of people here i wanted to believe i was going to taste a wonderful rich robust dram unfortunately this is not what i got there is smoke there is peat but there is no thickness or robustness in it at all even the smoke and peat tastes quickly disappear from the mouth and you are left only with iodine i am afraid to say i will also have a hard time drinking this whisky and i guess i will have to because i would never offer it to a friend overall you have the impression that its not a well balanced dram  this was one amazing experience early on if you rush the nose or the taste it hits a little too hard with the upfront smoke and you lose some of the spice and sweet layers that accompany it waiting a bit after your pour and then enjoying the nose waiting a bit more then taking a sip really makes a difference overall what a scotch encompasses so many flavors with so many incredible quot essences quot of sherry smoke vanilla and peat bravo  nose intense burnt wood campfire touch of oak in there somewhere and spice mostly smoke palate oily viscous and peaty smoke first chew spice faint cinnamon and burnt sugar mostly oak wood dry dry wood and smoke finish spice burnt vanilla and burnt brown sugar lastly campfire this is one of the smokiest scotches i have ever sampled i like it a lot but i dont pick up on the lapsang souchong tea i love toasted teas i don 39 t get that here to me its a tad 2 demensional scotch is very subjective to the drinker this one doesn 39 t call to me i prefer the laphroiag 10 year old i still give it a 4 its a great dram this whisky will destroy your tastebuds drink this at the end of your night you will taste campfire for at least 4 hours afterwards  i am a huge lover of all things scotch and lagauvulin is in my top 2 or 3 but i could not drink it all the time if i 39 m feeling like a nice strong scotch it is my go to if i feel like something a little more smooth then oban 14year single malt is the one if lagavulin i have always enjoyed speyside scotches the most because that 39 s just always been my preference a friend recently told me this was one of the best scotches he 39 s ever had so before i tried it of course i was skeptical however i must say i was blown away when i had this never enjoyed peaty scotch but this is truly exceptional true world class quality this was such a smooth tasting smokey scotch literally could have drank this all night  i didn 39 t like scotch until i was introduced to lagavulin by a coworker god bless him i 39 ve tried other islays and they 39 re largely ok save for one little five year old that may turn out to be drinkable with another ten years or so in the cask but i digress there is no substitute there is no equal if you 39 re going to drink scotch do it right  well i have read the reviews and all i have to say is this is the scotch that walks into the room and says piss off ya beta males i 39 m here and i 39 m smokin 39 it is an acquired taste it is a love it or leave it hopefully you leave it for the benefit of all the lovers of it all i can say is you walk up to the door to the reception of this marvelous home of scotch and it 39 s like your grandparents old house in the orkney 39 s you are greeted by mrs doubt fire in a wee whisper she takes you into her dining room taste room with oak clad walls tastefully plaqued with awards and citations on a long wood buffet sits bottles you only dream of there is no watchful eye but elegant and generous pouring of what ever you request the age deep into the late seventies if you like i try the lag ga voo lin 18 gold elixir of kilted gods i will not effuse winded descriptions of exotic teas and creosoted seal flippers i 39 ll leave that to the malthead cryptographers so in a wee brogue voice the grace and manners that your gran used to have she asks if you enjoyed it like asking a 16 year old what he thought of their first sexual experience my wife drags me away and god bless her ranks that as the best she has had including the trip to oban spyside as far south as bladnoch and glenkinchie as far north as scapa this is the peat this is liquid earth this is home this is what keeps you from killing yourself on a stark and desolate landscape now the 16 lovely and as a scot when costco in kona had it on every christmas for 46 00 a bottle cases disappeared much to the pleasure of my friends and family and every once and a while a newbee screws their face and scowls at the quot turpentine and burnt floor wax quot i serve them i smile non judgmental and think of brussell sprouts cigars and blue cheese so have a taste and hopefully you 39 ll get kicked in the nose and mouth and say that was the best lay ga vul in i ever had and one of the best scotches ever  i don t understand complainers here my personal favorite just ought a new bottle and it it one of the best whiskey especially for this price enjoying every moment of it it is smooth with tasty cherry ending the smokiness is rich and full but still not overwhelming the overall taste it is always a best buy for me  berry good aroma this whiskey has just become number one of my list the only way would taste better would be if i was wearing a smoking jacket as i peer out of the window from my study cussing out the snow  i have yet to drink anything better i can get lost in the simple smell of this beautiful whisky before i even start drinking it however i have served it to many friends who cringed after a first sip and declared politely that it wasn 39 t for them it 39 s best to let them smell the whisky first and decide if they even want to try a sip before serving them a more generous portion this is one whisky you either love or hate  i just received a bottle for my 40th anniversary and it suits perfectly with this new phase of my life just perfect  whisky king best of the best islay goodness  this stuff gives me immediate heartburn that gets worse with each sip the smokiness is great but the bottle i got is far from smooth as this is my first experience with lagavulin 16 it may need time to grow on me for now it gets 2 stars because i didn 39 t have to pay 100 for this bottle  a good friend gave me this bottle having decided it wasn 39 t to his taste i 39 m so glad he did that pungent and powerful to both the nose and the tongue smoke glorious smoke i understand we all have differing tastes but this was the most amazing taste of whisky i 39 ve ever had my go to dram has always been the simple yet delicious glenlivet 15 french oak i didn 39 t realize what i was missing in the islay malts well i 39 m catching on and now have a new hobby sampling these lovely flavorful whiskies thank you tiny island  not kidding tastes great when it 39 s freshly popped open and for a day or two after but then it all goes wrong and not only does the sherry finishing seem to disappear but also the minerally peat edge something is terribly wrong with laga 16 can any whisky explain this that 39 s the last bottle of this formerly great whisky i will ever buy so unless you 39 re gonna polish off the bottle in one night with your mates think again  needs to be in a locked safe with the combination only known by my wife so she can ration out to prevent me from draining the bottle at one sitting fantastic flavors and complexity with the islay peat woven throughout  brutal crap  one of the best single malts out there worth every penny  i sniffed before i sipped and commented that the smell reminded me of my doctor 39 s office one taste told me it 39 s not to my liking and the tasting notes above explained the medicinal smell iodine however from the many 5 star reviews many find it wonderful just be sure to try a sample before investing 60 in a bottle and don 39 t give it as a gift to someone who hasn 39 t tasted it  this is really great stuff huge nose full of peat smoke whiffs of brine and sweet oak and a hint of sherry and a dozen other discreet but cohesive hints then there is the explosive palate which i 39 m not even going to pretend i have fully explored the finish is probably the biggest i 39 ve ever experienced you 39 ll blow through half a bottle just exploring the nose on this it 39 s so good that even at 90 usd a bottle it seems like a great value  just got a bottle for christmas and i just savour every drop wonderful lingering after taste what a treat i 39 m hooked  my girl surprised me with the best whiskey i 39 ve ever had word to ron swanson even smelling it can make you intoxicated  disappointing rather flat and one dimensional with a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste makes me pine for my laphroig  got this for my birthday it is a spectacular scotch  got given my first ever bottle today for christmas i think if i had tried this 2 years ago when i first started exploring whisky i would not have liked it but now all i can say is wow this is the one i have been looking for absolutely magnificent  omg this whiskey bar far is the best its the first whiskey i can literally drink like a glass f wine no water no ice and no carbonated water it is so rich and smooth doesnt burn when you swallow the flavors are amazing oak leather and smokey flavors i cant describe the experience all i can say is that now im a lagavulin for life  i tried this whiskey many years ago and it 39 s my best by far sat with a lovely glass of lagavulin next to a raging log fire to round a perfect evening off the cognac of whiskeys a real gem tastes of bonfire absolutely outstanding if you 39 re a fan of the islay whiskeys not as smokey as the ardbeg in my opinion slightly sweeter as well  out of respect for ron i went ahead and bought some and unfortunately i thought it was awful not far from the paint thinner comment of another person on this thread ron and i may agree on libertarianism but definitely not on scotch  not a go out and buy actually it 39 s does nothing for me well it has smoke yeah but laphroaig tastes better  this was my first islay i ever tried at first wasn 39 t really sure what to think of it didn 39 t taste like any other scotch i 39 ve had before so didn 39 t like it so much as i have become a more seasoned scotch drinker i 39 ve become a peat head and when i tried this again i knew i 39 d be drinking it as long as i lived initial flavor is like that first cigarette you had in high school dangerous yet delightful then comes a wave of black tea and seaweed followed by black pepper and peat smoke epic it really does take you to the coast of islay and to anyone who didn 39 t like this try it again and again and again and eventually you will find yourself craving it this laphroaig triple wood and ardbeg uigaedail are the 3 best scotches out there right now and will always be a part of my collection the sugarbear it 39 s the only whisky you 39 ll ever need tastes like a bonfire at the beach on a cold windy night  i so want to love this great looking scotch however i have to agree with some of the people that are posting low scores on this scotch the plastic metallic smell is so overpowering for me i cannot finish my bottle i love macallan 12 and blue label but this i cant drink im wondering if its certain pallets that get this plastic metal smell or if its certain batches but this was very disappointing is anyone else who is an experienced scotch taster finding the same thing  awesome whisky this is my first islay but wow i like it nice colour thick and oily on the tongue the smoke is great not cigarish but like barbeque flavoured chips long smoky finish very well balanced  got a bottle for my birthday tastes of heaven those who 39 ve never walked through nw ireland in the wintertime probably can 39 t understand the peaty smell taste earthy luxurious  you need a tolerance for iodine to enjoy this and a mouthful of cigar smoke de gustibus non est disputandum  as a multi generation scotch family everyone has a favorite as far as bottles under a hundred dollars we all agree on this one truly a smokey scotch and may not be for amateur scotch enthusiasts though  absolutely outstanding whiskey an absolute must try up there with my other favourite whiskey bowmore 17 year thick smooth and smokey if you like bowmore laphroignore and ardbeg then you will live this  having no idea what single malts were about i had my scotish barkeep line up his favorites so i could sample them without knowing anything about them price location type reputation etc after several hours i finally got to lagavulin and i liked it best hands down it is now my standard for comparison to any other scotch there are others that are great but for the price it 39 s still my favorite  this scotch has a certain uniqueness that others simply don 39 t possess this scotch is certainly smokey and slightly sweet but the peatiness brings all the flavors together take a sip without ice and let it sit on your tongue for 10 15 seconds swallow and breathe slowly you 39 ll know exactly what i 39 m talking about cheers best peated whisky ever always have in my bar  i really struggle with the negative reviews of this and many other islay malts the intrinsic character of islay malts lies in its peated barley this imparts notes of chemical cleaners iodine and even formaldehyde and varying levels of smoke this smoke can be medicinal or bonfire depending on cask influence and peat ppm levels with that said i would recommend working up to a malt of this strong character try some speysiders or even a bowmore or bunnahabhain before taking this on as for my review and i should say i 39 ve had exactly one dram from my bottle i was hoping for more it 39 s not bad at all in fact i think it 39 s got a lot to offer but i 39 m finding it a bit uninspired the coat lines and legs are gorgeous nose roiling peat smoke beautiful barley sugar vanilla and soft oakpalate full and oily creamy even coats the tongue phenolic smoke leading into a touch of dried dark fruit vanilla and more of that soft oakfinish it starts slow with sweet raisin fig and dates and then fell a bit flat on me after a bit of time the smoke crept back inclosing thoughts this is a fine malt but for me the lack of complexity left me wanting i 39 ve got to try the distiller 39 s edition  nose new asphalt antiseptic ointment ripe apples with water new teabags and candy apple flavour amaretti biscuits fruitcake fruit sweet almond with water musk melon marzipan and malted milk finish almandine honey menthol and ben gay great halloween malt mark from whiskywhistle have been drinking lagavulin for over 20 years occasionally sample something else like macallan glenfeddich glenmorangie talisker balvenie etc many are good but none have the bold smokey satisfying flavor of lagavulin the smoked aroma of lagavulin takes away the taste of liquor in your palate and after three doubles of it you start feeling as it you have millions of dollars the morning after is a refreshing one because you want to eat your porridge before breakfast no hangovers at all  colour my glencairn nosing glass showed an almost greenish hue to the dark amber gold nose massive peat grips you by the face then slaps you the other reviews that describe the smell of band aids are spot on lapsang souchon tea so much depth and intensity of aroma incredible on the olfactory senses but balanced by a sweet creamy smoothness and slightly sherried nose body full bodied and oily palate peat overdose smoke iodine sea salt a hint of burnt fruit subtle sweetness hidden behind a veil of more peat and smoke if you can handle its undiluted intensity you 39 ll find a whiskey like few others the peat and smoke isn 39 t of the same ashtray like intensity of other peated single malts and the sherry aspect helps balance it and gives it a smoothness unlike any other single malt i 39 ve tasted incredible finish the longest but most pleasing finish should you be foolish enough to over indulge you 39 ll still be tasting it the morning after hopefully the first islay i tried i feel it 39 s best described as creamy oily liquid smoke not cheap by any means but utterly sublime i once thought it was only bettered by laphroaig quarter cask having returned to it i feel it 39 s more subtle sherried quality and smoothness over qc give it the top spot incredible stuff and for me the greatest whisky i 39 ve had so far on this incredible journey  i 39 ll start by saying that i 39 m a glenlivet man my lagavulin 16 experience was very bad my first thought was quot paint thinner quot simply impossible to drink i 39 ve only had the problem once before with a sample bottle of islay whisky i 39 ve read the reviews and your descriptions of quot smokey quot and quot woody quot are accurate i tried another sip without ice and it went down but it 39 s going to take some time before i acquire a taste for it  being a scotch lover lagavulin is great so is all scotch at this level of quality i enjoy variety even 6 year old famous grouse however i do drink lagavulin more often than others  but after a few days of sampling it my opinion has changed i hit it at a 1 2 shot per night even at 100 a bottle its practically a bargain a lot of people mention the woody notes but theres more to it the kick has its own complexities that carry an evolving profile as it settles on the pallet i love it i expect the bottle to continue to evolve as i drink it over time a rare pleasure  some morons actually drinks this with ice correct temperature is everything with a single malt a bit too high or low and it changes character still my favorite btw a winter whisky  ok i 39 m only here because ron swanson recommended this i received my first bottle of lagavulin 16 as a gift from some of my members i have always enjoyed the glen 12 as my usual drink no more your 16 year old scotch has a new best friend i love the mellow smokey flavor that stays with you long after the drink my favorite scotch of all  if you like this one you should get your hands on a bottle of the cask strength lagavulin i picked up one at marty 39 s in newton ma when on a business trip there 4 5 years ago and it is spectacular a bit pricey though this has been my favorite malt for years although i got a bottle of cask strength old stock from ardbeg a few years ago that came pretty damned close  title speaks for it self simply astonishing how well rounded this single malt is if i could afford a closet full of this i would always have one around if i had one item to bring on a desert island it would be this bottle  somebody reviewed this single malt and called it undrinkable and unquaffable well of coz its undrinkable if you quaff it this whisky is to be savoured it 39 s complex but interesting i don 39 t pretend to taste the myriads of flavours the experienced drinkers mention i just know that this is one good whisky to be savoured alone or with a few good friends and you 39 ll find peace on earth even if it 39 s temporary  because the are from texas i am enjoying both the lagavulin 16 and the laphraoig 18 i have chronic sinus issues so i miss some of the nose and aroma but i do get the aftertaste and these are very smooth to me  i had this at chicago restaurant in marietta georgia great if you like a quot smokey scotch quot then you will love this one   but the mom description seems a bit outdated the current bottlings actually come across as s bit thin for a 16 and far from the most powerful islay on the nose that said it 39 s beautiful and the bottle gets better as the level descends below the shoulders the sherry influence for my tastes is just about perfect eliminating entirely the sulphurous pitfalls of many such finishings but the price at 90 100 in the carolinas it 39 s not practical for 39 everyday 39 enjoyment and for me the power and glory of lagavulin resides in the 12 year which unfortunately has crept to 130ish most places here 39 s a tip to enjoy them both pour off 1 2 of the 16 and add 1 2 tablespoons of the 12 or for the risk adverse pour 6 ounces into an empty 1 2 pint and add 3 4 tbs don 39 t dare call yourself a lagavulin freak unless you try this add a little of the 12 or 16 as needed to reach your optimum profile for times when the staid diplomatic beauty of the 16 could use a nudge of invigoration you can now date her red headed sister she 39 ll even encourage you hip hip at the 65ish price in the dc area picking up a case there makes the 16 ia stone cold winner and currently the best standard bottling of any distillery imo  the only real mans drink clear alcohols are for rich women on diets this is not really a review i 39 m just completely baffled by one of the reviews on this page why the fuck would anybody want to mix a 60 80 bottle of islay malt with coke its like getting a fine piece of toro and dipping in ranch dressing as far as the drink itself its a masterpiece if islay is your thing i know many seasoned scotch drinkers that can 39 t palate anything from islay i 39 ve wasted many fine drams on such drinkers  i read every single review on here before purchasing a bottle my initial though after opening the bottle was quot holy s it quot the flavor is flavor and texture is beyond belief i was an oban 14 drinker but no longer a great scotch from start to finish buy it  the first thing you smell is pure smoke the first thing you taste is pure smoke at first i was pretty disappointed in this malt because of it 39 s reputation and price all i got was smoke and nothing else however after leaving it in the glass for about 15 20 min it began to release a great deal of flavors and some added sweetness which makes it quite enjoyable i personally don 39 t add any water to it but i do let it sit and open up there is much more smoke than peat in this one which i really like peat is good but after a little while the taste can be over powering in some scotch like bowmore 12 imo  there is no sherry casks used in the production of lagavulin 16yr old the sweetness is due to the high grade bourbon cask being used 98 of this is for single malt the rest for white horse blends it 39 s the best of the best anywhere in scotland period i clean out my car engine with johnny walker red i did 39 nt know you drank it stupid american  one of the first single malts i 39 d tasted and it was such an eyeopener maybe not the best introductory whisky for newbies but for me it worked lovely stuff of smoke and sweetness always having a bottle of this around together with the glendronach 15 d  i 39 ve been drinking lagavulin for a while now and i 39 m never disappointed however the recent bottle that i cracked open just tastes flat there is no peaty smoke to it nor that seaweed iodine taste that i liked this one feels likes its a completely different whiskey and not a lagavulin at all i can taste the vanilla but then an under current of coconut it 39 s a 2014 batch not sure if this a bad bottled year  absolutely love the complexity of this scotch  i have been drinking lagavulin 16 for almost 10 years i have a few in the cabinet like highland park jura and caol ila but my favorite of all is lagavulin great with a single ice cube single drop of water or neat it does not matter  i had high expectations about this malt and i must say the widely exceeded of course who believes otherwise is not used to a taste with a complex of sensations construction not a whiskey for inexperienced rookies  i could not taste anything besides gasoline and paint thinner i wished desperately to enjoy it though  prior to experiencing lagavulin 16 i only enjoyed certain islays a lot of them simply seemed to pungent and overbearing for my palate but once i came to try this i was totally hooked not only on this particular islay but to others as well another reviewer described it as a quot great entry level islay quot and i would say that is a fair description yet even though i 39 ve moved on to and have grown to love many others i still find myself coming back to this  the smokey nose and smooth burnt finish make this scotch a winner for me although in the upper price realm i feel for a 16yo single it still represents a solid buy we always keep a bottle on hand and yes it goes quite nicely with a fine robusto  lagavulin 12 cask strength is much better in lagavulin 16 woody note overpowers everything else still good whisky but legend try springbank 12 cas strenght to taste what true legend in making is  what can i say that hasn 39 t been said simply put this is the best entry level islay whisky period it 39 s perfect if you don 39 t love it go back to your sherry bombs  if god would have made a better islay single malt he would have kept it for himself  there is definitely something unique about lagavulin its hard to mistake for anything else i really don 39 t think the nose is quot stunning quot as the tasting notes suggest unless it 39 s about the pungency of the peat in which case maybe although there are more pungent peaty whiskies about there is a dryness to the peat and it is really phenolic and smoky i also don 39 t agree that its quot thick quot maybe times have moved on its potent but it 39 s also only 43 which limits the concentration of flavour for me this is more the middle ground but not in price given the price and what is on offer its definitely more of a myth than a legend for me the finish is quite wishy washy i really do dispute that it is long theres a bit of peat and a slight pepperiness but compared to other peaty whiskies its lacking and its much more expensive its good but not great  when your palate begins to develop you really will appreciate what a fantastic and legendry whisky this really is  expected nice smooth quot oily quot taste instead horrible taste similar to fernet strong herby taste  was expecting a very good scotch due to almost all 5 star reviews here but the hard iodine taste overpowers everything else and makes it undrinkable for me  i 39 m usually not a big fan of islay whisky but i 39 ll make an exception for lagavulin the nose alone is worth the price of the bottle and the taste and finish have a quot roundness quot to them that i find hard to find in other islay whiskies  i have yet to find such an extinguish taste as i have found in the lagavulin it is available in every vinmonopol category 3 and upwards at least in norway  knew it was something special at the first drink smokey and peaty to start with a long lingering finish you simply can 39 t have just one dram lagavulin 16 is a staple in my home i 39 m never without  i have a few whiskeys in my collection and i like them all but if i had to drink only one forevermore it would be lagavulin 16 first bottle was given to me as a gift by my other half we thought we woudld have an occasional glass and it would be there for years with many of the other spirits we have in the house but it was gone after 3 weeks its more than i would usually spend but as we enjoyed it so much i have vowed to never be without a bottle and so have purchased a few more of all the peated whiskeys its easily the most balanced the peat is strong but not overpowering like it so often is in these peated whiskeys it makes itself known but gets out of the way for the smooth flavours to come through and boy is it smooth the hint of iodine is there towards the end but is complementary rather than offputting and just adds to the character of this drink for me as with most whiskeys its best at room temperature with literally quot a drop quot of water to balance it all out you need to try this at least once in your life if peated whiskeys are your thing i struggle to see how it cant become a favourite  such a wonderful scotch to drink with a good book in front of a fireplace on a snowy day  i am a fan of talisker 10 but this scotch raises the bar smooth with a magical blend of flavors and complexity  to the boy that thought he opened a bottle of paint thinner you should stick to drinking wild turkey or perhaps southern comfort with that said to those of you that are looking for a peaty smoky finish this is for you the quality and long finish is second to none this is private stock material  a a rule i don 39 t drink but i will always break the drought with a fine whiskey i have one bottle stashed on my boat and that is lagavulin  i hear it all the time add a few drops of water or a single cube to get the full spectrum of flavors in the past i dutifully tried every new whisky straight and then with additions without exception i ended up wishing i had not added anything so now i don 39 t i 39 m drinking l16 right now superb  as a driver in the highlands i deliver to a lot of these distillery the 16 is certainly very good if you like the peaty ones also try ledaig laphroaig glenmorangie if you like the peaty ones talisker bunnahabhain bowmore and highland park and antiquary great too  spent an evening smoking cigars and sipping this excellent scotch with some friends i hadn 39 t seen in a long while heartily recommended  i recomended to try lagavulin 12yo good as 16yo for me it started with that smokey peat and laughably i definitely got bacon some back palet of fruit and the sherry notes come through nicely i feel this one is lovely but not rich or bold enough for me aberlour a 39 bunadh and nikka fr m the barrel have been my latest treats so maybe i have been used to bigger lately but i still feel it needs more  i love my islay whiskies and this has taken the reins as the best i have had the balance is perfect between all the elements and it is wonderfully smooth i could smell this whisky all night  one of the best ones wonderfully rich and smokey if i had to choose a whiksey that i have to drink for the rest of my life this would be the one  first experience with an islay found it to be very distinctive and rich wonderful peaty smoke nose and a burst of flavor on the first sip definitely will imbibe again in the near future  just received a bottle for my birthday wow what an experience i have dabbled a bit from laphroaig to macallens lagavulin is incredible a slow draw and a tear in my eye perfect  simply the best and no amrut fusion bowmore and even blue are not as goodmy 25 year old son brought a bottle of lagavulin 16 to a recent gathering of his college friends now all young professionals after tasting amazed they asked quot why do you have a scotch like this quot his response quot why don 39 t you have a scotch like this quot  not as peaty as laphroaig love the fruit oak n peat combination right now my favourite  beautiful smokey taste with a hot after bite great whiskey for a novice and seasoned professional fantastic  was looking forward to trying my bottle of lagavulin 16 the other night 1 oz over ice and thought i opened paint thinner by mistake found it to be undrinkable and was glad the liqour store took the opened bottle back i guess the smokey plastic taste is acceptable to a lot of people will stick with my glenlivet and macallan i enjoy most of the island malts but lagavulin although slightly more expensive is a nice one to bring to the table i like the bottle label dark colour and of course the taste served only with ice one to share with people who have an appreciative pallette  the smell is a bit overpowering but absolutely delicious  this stuff is the milk of the gods it 39 s just a masterpeace  this is a great wiskey amrut fusion an india whiskey is its equal although not a scotch it has all the charteristics of one and half of the barley is imported from scotland trust me their both great is this guy kidding the only quot mix quot i would have with this whiskey or any other in it 39 s class is a little bit of high quality water experienced drinker my ass i 39 ve only been getting into single malts for a few years now and even i know better than that mix with coke that 39 s insane no wonder he doesn 39 t like it  i was stationed at holy loch scotland in the early 1980 39 s when i was in the navy i now regret that i did not enjoy the many many excellent whiskies that are produced in that beautiful land of my ancestors but i was just a stupid kid and only new about jwr and black and the only thing the locals seem to know about was the famous grouse yuck the difference between tfg and lagavulin is like comparing lead and gold my only regret is that it took me almost 30 years to discover that better late than never cheers  solid 4 5 star rating  i just received a bottle along with a few others in an online purchase i got it at a steal for 62 normally this whisky sells for 90 plus tax at the local discount liquor super store i 39 m here to tell you that this is one of the best buys i 39 ve ever made in my 57 years on earth what a superb whisky truly remarkable i 39 m just an aspiring scotch lover and don 39 t have the sophistication of describing in detail the many sensations i had when tasting this fine whisky but i know what i like and i really like this at this price i 39 m going to guy a case of this while it is still on sale this is definitely in my top 5 along with glenfarclas all years talisker 10 oban 14 and tomatin 18 cheers  i dont understand why i dont like lagavulin my favorite whiskys are ardbeg kilchoman laphroiag arran and bowmore im a islay guy ive tried lagavulin 16 and 12 even the double matured sherry version do not like any of them full bodied ppl say the smoke is there and its the right islay trademark smoke but thats it really bhind the smoke i get some faint sweet flavour but it taste kinda plastic aspartame sweet  when it comes to eastern wisdom this is as far east as i go man as with many scotch drinkers i started with the speysides and highlands enjoyed them immensely but craving ever more flavors moved on the the islays now there is no going back nothing else will do i keep bowmore 18 and ardbeg uigeadail on the shelf but find myself going for the lagavulin 16 time after time a masterpiece  yes this is the stuff all good things are made of advice to all who try this amazing nectar don 39 t have a different whisky within weeks of taking lagavulin you will feel let down nothing compares to lagavulin 16  wanted this for a long time best single malt from islay  tried this for the first time last night was not prepared for the smokey peat to me it initially tasted like i was trying to drink liquified pipe tobacco after a little while i adjusted perhaps its just my pallet i am so used to and love my glenlivet i 39 ll give it another go before i pass judgment  i 39 ve been a scotch lover since i was in college and that was a long time ago this is the best in my opinion however it is smokey and very peatey so has an interesting flavor which to some may take a while to get accustomed to and appreciate but once you experience it be advised because you will probably be addicted  tried this monster at a whisky bar recently my wife had a bbq bacon cheeseburger and i had a dram of lagavulin i felt like we probably had the same experience very smoky nose with strong bacon and bbq notes coming through finish was the iconic seaweed iodine islay finish i will now keep a bottle of this in my collection at all times  i have read a few negative reviews on here and i respect that everyone has their own tastes and opinions however if you do not like this bottle you simply do not like scotch i wouldn 39 t comment on rum or taylor swift 39 s new album because i know i would dislike all versions if you like scotch this is worth trying  i have to say the first taste i was thinking someone handed me a glass of jonny walker blue more peaty and smokey though and a bit more of a after taste due to the smokey flavor all in all definitely worth a try i would hear reviews about quot peaty quot amp quot smoky quot whiskies and would be scared yet excited to know if i would like this type of whisky or not this bottle was my introduction and i am by far pleased with the taste it held my hand to understand completely now what reviewers are talking about when they speak about quot smoke quot and how it is such a pleasant flavor when tasting other notes in whisky i must admit that for the quality you are getting within this price range is absolutely fantastic i think this bottle just became a signature staple on my shelf  i love that this is made by diageo i saw this at a liquor store in denver tonight it was priced at 42 00 since i didn 39 t know this scotch i opted for a bottle of cognac i think i 39 ll go back and get one after reading all these reviews  this is easily one of the most enjoyable single malts i have had the pleasure of drinking from islay this is a smokey pete whiskey with a great finish one of the best but a little on the expensive side for the alcohol content well worth the money though and a great treat  this whisky is just not quaffable smells like plastic tastes like i imagine a vinyl car seat would taste if it were ground up and fermented in water  for the money one of the best ive had by far  this is simply the best of the best in my choice of single malt whiskey  i am fairly new to whisky started with a view mini 39 s at first the peated whisky 39 s made me kind of sick but i grew on it now i think the smoky ones are the best the smokier the better i absolutely adore it i didn 39 t expect that to happen ardbeg connemara caol ila very very nice drams but this one the lagavulin is the best of them all for now i even closed my eyes when i tasted this whisky it 39 s delicious wow  i was given a bottle for christmas and it has such a strong iodine that it is non drinkable with compost since i do not drink iodine i can see no reason why to try to drink a good scotch that has such a bad aftertaste i was told that heavy cigar smokers love this product not being a cigar smoker i wonder if all of their taste buds are burned off  just grand love my kids for their good taste  my first taste of this nectar of the gods made me feel like the barrel has washed ashore and stayed in a cave for a long time beautiful peat smoke and the essence of the sea with no salt my favorite  my son presented this to me for christmas and what a celebration after dinner many of us at the table put the finishing touches on a great meal with this fantastic scotch it 39 s all about the smokey bass thanks remy  enjoyed it on christmas eve after a great meal  when you come across this drop all you can do is respect the scotch  very smooth peaty but it leaves something to be desired on the finish i ended up buying a 2nd bottle after the first just to make sure i wasn 39 t missing anything and it was consistent with the first just doesn 39 t do it for me entirely the strange thing is it did leave me with some desire for it after the fact and i did go back for that 2nd bottle there is something hidden there i may just not have identified after the 2nd bottle though i 39 m still scratching my head trying to figure it out and i think the desire may have just been the missing components i was looking for that just were not there with this whisky and hoping i would find overall not a bad whisky but moving on  this is my favorite islay in my area it is pricey what can i say perfection isn 39 t cheap  lagavulin 16 is easily the most beautifully crafted thing ever bottled a distinct but not overwhelming peat flavor with notes of sea spray to begin after a few sips the notes of caramel and i am in the minority opinion with this but chocolate covered raisins come through i wish i can give it more than a 10 10 because that just doesn 39 t seem good enough  for those who love it would probably give it 5 stars the first point it hits your nose the strong palette the lingering after taste would probably leave the people who enjoy this taste wanting more unfortunately she is not a lady for me she smells like that ash smell when you go to the dentist and they drill your molars for cavity then it lingers within your mouth like a long been put out cigar  extremely smokey yet remarkable smooth the peat on nose on this sucker will nearly knock you out and is overpowering the taste is mesmerizing with a sherry sweetness lingering on the palate with the finish new favorite  i had a chance to sit down with a bottle last night truely a great scotch it got better and better with every mouthful  the nose is nothing special your usual islay malt smoke peaty smell the palate is a vast improvement however the finish is without a doubt one of best i have ever tasted very few world whiskies will have you going to bed dreaming of waking up with the same taste still in your mouth as much as this will it is a must try i accept that it 39 s not as good as it used to be but it is still without a doubt the best entry level whisky on the market and for the price it is definitely a bit of a steal i 39 ve had more expensive whisky that were not as good as this but still in my opinion were still worth the price i paid it 39 s far from the finished product but if you get the chance you have to give it a try hauntingly brilliant taste smooth smoky peat and sherry flavor great after taste that lingers for a long time where the hints of vanilla comes through i can still taste it i would never mix anything with this outstanding single malt hands down my favorite scotch  during my stay at twin farms i wanted to try scotch and knew about glenlivet to my surprise the attended ask me several questions about my spirit choices after we exchanged notes he asked if would mind trying this i gave it a try and never once looked back to want the glenlivet the smoke and peat is such a great blend yes these are not for everyone 39 s pallet but if you like the rich smoke and peat in a scotch that 39 s meant to be drank neat this is perfect  the irish would say quot brilliant quot but then they say that when i make correct change seriously this is nirvana for me i 39 ve tried a number of others many of which were fine scotches but that smokey peaty richness just does me in quot heaven i 39 m in heaven quot  this is the best scotch i have ever had doesn 39 t get more complex and interesting for an experienced single malt palate than lag if you aren 39 t ready for something like this that 39 s ok it takes some time wiht singles to appreciate something like this and if you are so fucking stupid that you would mix something as artistic and unique as lagavulin with anything you should be immediately euthanized beware the mix seriously what a moron anyone who talks about quot mixers quot on a single malt page is galactically stupid spare us all from your stupidity jump on a kitchen knife stay away from these pages to the folks complaining that lag is just too smoky one person asks how to quot mitigate the smoke quot this is a smoky islay scotch you wouldn 39 t go to one of the original meat market smokehouses in lockhart texas taste their brisket and then go up to the counter and ask them how to get rid of the smoke you wouldn 39 t call up the cohiba factory and cuba and ask them why the maduros you just got taste so smoky here 39 s how to quot mitigate the smoke quot give that bottle to someone who appreciates it and enjoy your chivas and your tony roma 39 s ribs  ignore beware the mix he 39 s been trolling on several whiskey threads with the same stuff quot doesn 39 t mix well with my doctor pepper quot quot doesn 39 t go so well with my lucozade quot etc the lag 16 gives a peat smoke flavour so refined as to be a standard against which others are measured a classic peated islay to be kept always on hand to teach of peat smoke pure and tasteful  shared amongst brothers very well received the most satisfying and tasty malt my under experienced palate has tasted should have bought 2 bottles  nose is smoky salty iodine with subtle mint and citrus very smooth on the tongue thick peat smoky goodness long smooth smoky finish ahhhh the show quot parks and recreation quot led me to want to try this whiskey as one of the iconic characters refuses to drink any whiskey besides this one so i assumed it was a man 39 s drink the show was right this is a great and powerful smokey and flavorful whiskey definitely worth the price  an experienced drinker wouldn 39 t dream of mixing a single malt with coke or anything for that matter especially the lagavulin 16 perhaps you are an experienced drinker of cheap whiskeys  is this a joke quot experienced drinker quot quot if like me you like to mix your whisky with coke quot quot there are much better drams out there quot  please be warned by an experienced drinker this does not mix well at all if like me you like to mix your whisky with coke irn bru or lemon then this is not for you there are much better drams out there  i 39 ve seen this scotch described as quot massively peaty quot whilst it 39 s certainly peaty it 39 s not massive not in the same league as ardbeg or laphroaig but it 39 s certainly very nice spicy and rich and full of tatse it 39 s not amazing but a lovely scotch and reasonably cheap so try it  first impressions caol ila 12 but stronger a little disappointed even though i like caol ila 12 i was hoping for something bolder on second taste however the spirit as it often happens came to life much more smoke on the nose and salt on the palate as a huge bourbon drinker and a fan of every islay i 39 ve had so far it definitely ranks as one of the best however at the price it is it should have a higher abv 46 50 and no chill filtering price aside it is great stuff  amazing taste sip it and saviour but don t go near it if you are basic blended and water person enough said  smoke all the way not your every dram  shared your gem with a gathering of 100 us academics in london last week stunned by its potent aroma and unending smooth taste l quickly became known as liquid smoke my task should i accept it is now to ship tasters and or bottles to our next gathering in october 2015 all help appreciated  i had always been more partial to small batch bourbons than whiskey once i was offered a glass of lagavulin 16 it was obvious the reason was because i had never had the right whiskey before delightful bold complex taste that lingers it has become my quot adult beverage quot of choice  mmm the smell and taste take me to the atlantic ocean home salt and peat smoke on the nose big rich mouthful spicy and peaty with a sherry influence vanilla and figs peat and smoke lasts for several minutes this commands respect  recent batches of lagavulin 16 lack the sherry cask influence that was present even just a few years ago it s still decent just different and less complex than it used to be without the sherry cask involvement  прекрасный виски один из самых любимых я вижу предыдущий комментатор жалуется на взлёт цен на lagavulin в сша я не знаю сколько стоит он в америке но в украине lagavulin 16 стоит 1200 грн зарплата 2000 3000 грн это не описка так что братья американцы не печальтесь не только вам тяжело  someone asked my recently quot what s your favourite whisky quot it s an impossible question but if i had to answer all things considered it would be this lagavulin 16  warning any positive review you may have seen about lv 16 is an absolute understatement when brian cox says this one is his favorite now i know why i give it a 10 out of 10 it is hard to imagine a single malt getting any better delicious just the right balance of smoke peat sweetness complexity zero burn magnificent even with recent price run ups in the us it is worth it  in one word genius jl if you like smoke and peat with a hint of sweetness sherry you will love this it has an outside seaside savour to it don t listen to negative reviews can t imagine anyone who really appreciates good scotch not appreciating this it is a favorite among many long time scotch drinkers  i must have been looking for like months before i found this totally awesome whisky the usa of course makes the most epic whiskies but this is totally not bad i would give it like 8 out of 10 and rate it as high as like a jim beam big jim kentucky agreed a mediocre islay malt was great when i starting out in the world of single malts but somehow lacking now  this is a very smooth flavoursome scotch but i find it so overwhelmingly smokey so as to be undrinkable deeply disappointed can any one suggest how to mitigate the smokiness  i ve been desperate for a regular drinking scotch to have a few drams of on weeknights or quiet saturdays and i have found it this is such a delicious whisky with just the right blend of sweetness and peat it is just at the top end price wise of what i would consider to be affordable everyday whisky but it is absolutely worth it  few years ago this was magnificent malt but not anymore no it s just a mediocre islay malt so sad  i was hesitating to buy this because of the sweetness but don t worry at all i took the risk and it payed of big time this is a very balanced whisky i would recommend this to anyone who has ardbeg caol ila and talisker  a smoky rich very smooth and balanced whisky highly recommended peter hands down the best single malt sipping one after dinner makes the day complete  very tastywill buy againwhoever makes this you have brought me back to the land of scotch to the person who said women can t appreciate a good whisky i m a woman and this is my favourite it s mellow honey tasting but not to sweet with some and vanilla words don t do this justice it s nectar  i ve been sipping on this whisky for a few hours now trying out the flavours and letting it grow on me when you put your nose to the glass you get a smokiness that is truly beautiful it s lapsang souchong dark wood strong with the aromas of a warm fire or a burning cigar the lagavulin 16 is an instant favourite and it is a whisky that will always be on my shelf however i do advise anyone who is new to single malt whiskies to try something else perhaps a speyside whisky before moving on to the islas because the rich flavours of the lagavulin will be lost on you it s a whisky to be savoured and taken in little sips a truly fantastic buy and the beginning of a new love affair  my wife just bought me a bottle of this for father s day and i was suitably impressed wonderful nose great and clean finish i am a big fan of peated scotch and smoky flavours its going to be difficult to not polish off this bottle quickly  hi guys need your help i know nothing about whiskeys but reading these reviews i think this may be a good 30th birthday present for my fiance opinions please xx i thought i wouldn t like the peated stuff after being put off a bit by ardbeg s intensity but a glass of this a few days ago changed my mind completely the peat was like a scaffold for the other flavors to dance around on great balance and loooong finish sweeter than i thought it would be and smoky and coastal in the best ways possible it stayed on my palate all night a treat that was well worth the high price  as the title says great raisin and fruit mixed with slight salty medicinal but thick rolling smoke recent bottling i tried is not as oily or viscous as previous ones something that jim murray also notes in his whisky bible 2014 why i wonder what a useless review below dated 9 june 2014 really worth reading not  yeah it s ok i wouldn t punch the person who gifts this bottle to me i just would not pay the price myself as with most whiskys burns your mouth and numbs your palate drink enough of it and it doesn t matter  my son bought me a bottle for my birthday i was always a highland park man but this stuff is incredible sweet smokey very complex i agree with others that a touch of water opens it up wonderful  i m a big fan of islay whisky s although i like this lagavulin i found the nose to be not too complex and doesn t last very long on the tongue it can be quite harsh to the uninitiated but i find a teaspoon of chilled scottish spring water brings out the flavours better it s not as smooth as say cao ila which i find more to my liking nonetheless it makes for a nice dram and refines my palette further if you like smokey heather vanilla nuts but not sweet then i would recommend bunnahabhain 12 yo reserve there was also a special edition reserve for duty free airports which i bought that was very nice too this one i would also add a teaspoon of spring water to bring the flavours nose out  made of the finest unicorn tears this is is one is my go to  as my father worked on islay as a young man i had a heads up on this particular brand it really is a wonderfully rich scotch with abundant peaty aroma and taste it does n t scald the palate like some other single malts rather it warmly envelopes you pricey but absolute value for money  if people are going to comment on the whisky or matters involving whisky then i really think they should be up to an acceptable standard of education before you accept their views really some of the grammar spelling and script is quite quite appalling please try and up the standards ronald silvermore  can t beat this stuff pure class all time favourite  nothing to add for me always be no 1 although a person of modest means your lagavulin 16 is the only scotch that i will drink no more chevis regal for me i am totally ruined for any other scotch i love the smoky peat taste   and the other way around try this with anything on the mellow side of alice in chains jesus christ  suckling on the maternal teat magic  drinking some now you got it down lagavulin makers i know it s bad for me to have just one more but just one more so expensive but perfection is worth it i can t afford more than a bottle every once in a while but maybe that s a good thing my liver will be the better for it an explosion of wow in my mouth with every sip thank you  i am not very very impressed with this scotch i like smoke in my whiskey and bought a bottle of lagavulin 16yo with promise of similarities with lafraugh however the lagavulin is not in any way matched with the lafraugh it doesn t taste bad but there s no strenght to it either  i bought a bottle for my son we tasted it and it was just beautiful son was so impressed that he had to share it with everyone who visited seriously i m afraid i would only share with very close friends who had an appreciation of a good whiskey  i am new to the single malt scene and in my limited knowledge must say this is the best whiskey i ve ever had it s an educational experience this whiskey like i said i the title this one is my best yet  i have just tasted this and it is truly exceptional it starts with a beautiful mouth feel and then the complexity is amazing it is what i am looking for when i want an islay whiskey i can hardly wait to have some with good smoked salmon  anyone who describes this scotch as quot ok quot knows little about islay scotch and probably is dumb enough to mix it with soda  ardbeg has had its moments in recent history unbeatable 5 6 years ago for sure laphroaig will always be a huge favourite and is as good as its ever been but lagavulin is in a different league at the moment its complex deep rich and all consuming compared to the ardbeg much more 3 dimensional its finesse and refinement put it apart from the laphroaig the most complete whisky you can get at the moment it s a must try in my book this is a reasonable dram but nothing compared to the ardbegs or laphroaigs the much more mellow peatiness of this makes it a good cool down after a couple of the former whiskies though it s a fun feeling to have the peatiness of a laphroaig still lingering in your nose while you sip on one of these however even that said i far prefer the distiller s edition if getting a lagavulin the sweetness makes it a bit more rounded than the rotten driftwood flavor i get from this one still i wouldn t turn it down and it s substantially better than many more expensive whiskies i ve tried slightly better than the similar talisker 18  there is no better islay whisky the ardbeg freaks need to take heed  just tasted this i have tasted some great whiskies this has to be a favorite in my collection magnificent whiskey for its age and price this was my first ever single malt i remember driving home thinking quot 50 is at the very peak of my financial capabilities so this better be good and worth the reviews quot and i wasn t disappointed somewhere i had read that if you choose lagavulin as your first ever single malt the rest might never feel that good again well it s absolutely right not that there aren t any better whiskies in the world there probably are but for a first ever single malt this is indeed incredibly good easy to drink perfect balance between peat smoke and sherry after drinking about 15cl you still feel that amazing peat after taste even after 10 15 minutes truly special stuff highly recommended  amazing taste needs 20 swirls before drinking get ready to have a totally different scotch experience  this is a fantastic single malt for those looking for something a little different out of their whisky it does have a strong almost medicinal smell iodine is a fitting reference but don t be put off the best part is the intense smoky finish which comes so smoothly to the senses while not for the faint of heart this is truly one of the finest drams for those who like a unique experience from their whisky my favorite single malt to date  clear alcohol is for rich women on diets this is a real drink  so far the most balanced regular bottling of any distillery i ve tried at its price range nothing else compares to this beautiful dram  have you noticed yours is the only bad review this is the best single malt nay whiskey period  as a laphroig man i was eagre to taste this i must say this is very very nice whiskey the smoke peat fruity sweetness oak all shine through really enjoyable taste an overall excellent whiskey  so far my penultimate and to the ridiculous single bloke commenting below i hope it is giving you solace me keeping some under my petticoats 20 years on as a single malt drinker never tasted anything better as yet not for everyone surely as it takes many years to develop the palate i used to drink neat but use little ice nowadays always keep one at home very refined  bought a bottle of this just after christmas and i m fairly new to whisky heard a lot of great stuff about it which does no justice for it it s not only the best whisky i ve tried it s one of the best drinks i ve tried alcoholic or non alcoholic must buy  make no mistake this is a man s malt not one to argue with but one to embrace with sensitivity to maximise the taste enjoyment of course the fair sex drinks malts too but i doubt many of them will swap their highland park for this beast any time soon indeed even some men may well prefer a dram that s a little less in their face fortunately my favourite tea is lapsang souchong this is the alcoholic and cold version with a peaty smokiness that takes you straight to the distillery building but that s not all uniquely dominant though the peat is it s beautifully counterbalanced by rich spicy fruit amp a reasonable snooze in the sherry barrel i can guarantee that this is one malt that once tasted you ll never ever forget right i m off for a cup of lapsang then again  each time i have a sip it gets better and better it s astonishing  it is the definition of scotch whiskey to me so wonderful and beautiful it s supurb  i taste the edge of the whiskey barrel touching the whiskey it s so good is amazing there s a sweetness to it that rolls off your tongue the smoke and peat is perfectly balanced with the sweetness it truly is the ultimate scotch whiskey for me  the best period  one of the best islay whiskies there is  absolutely superb just the right balance of peat smoke and fruity complexity incredible value for money at the price too  how clever of lagavulin to mature their entry level at 16 years it subdues the intensity of the peat and allows appreciation of all the other complex flavours that make this such a knock out islay if you are a peat freak then you may find this underwhelming but if you like a balanced dram then this is for you a very fine islay   quot cognac of whiskies quot brian coxhttp www youtube com watch v 5hgtps2_ut8 it is how it is supposed tot be pretty close to perfect no need for ice or water  tried the 12 as a very new entrant to the world of whisky never had anything like it made me smile a lot very rewarding so had to try the 16 completely different experience more refined certainly a lovely smokiness but no peaty fire like the 12 for me next bottle is going to be back to the 12 i think which is handy coz its cheaper altho i will prob have to try the 16 distillers edition as ive heard its cracking for 65 odd quid it better be long live laga  i am in no way a fan of peated or smokey whisky i can t stand ardbeg laphroig etc but with lagavulin its different even though its rich the flavours of the smoke and peat are well balanced on the tongue this not only makes it drinkable for me but something really nice the first time i tried it was at a whisky live tasting even they recommended having a smoked cheese along with a lagavulin to promte the flavours and it works  lovely peat although a bit dry and ashy very nice medicinal notes nice smoothness shows the benefit of those 16 years in the cask my only problem is the price fans of lagavulin 16 should try ian macleod s smokehead which although clearly younger by taste is considerably cheaper and i will bet money that it is made either by lagavulin themselves or lagavulin s sister company caol ila  and this is not the stuff it used to be very sad this is an amazing scotch smoky wonderful nose sweet finish and very easy to drink priced reasonably too this and the laphroaig 18 at my favorites among the smoky peaty and sweet scotches same price as the 18 laphroaig both benefit with the addition of a teaspoon of water to enhance the favors  there s cheap booze and expensive booze and they are 2 completely different things previous reviewers have described the taste well and i love me some lagavulin taste but nobody s touched on the warm rush that you get when good booze hits your stomach lagavulin gives me a warm spreading rush like no other after about the third sip i just melt cheap booze can t do that at all it s right up there with playing really loud electric guitar on a good night when your band is tight and almost as good as really good sex seriously good whisky one of the best drams i ve tried peace bernie blows like the oklahoma winds  lagavulin 16 year old is like sipping angels water an experience to savour like no other scotch  my friend and i both have a bottle of the lag16 his is a 2012 batch l2 and mine is a 2013 l3 the difference is big the 2013 is aggressive on the tong less smoothness less peat lesssss sweetness sherry compared to the 2012 i had a 2012 last year too ps note the batch date by the number following the letre quot l quot on the lower portion of the bottlestill very good but not the quot magical quot drink it was just a year ago  love the smokey after taste you have to be a real scotch drinker to appreciate this scotch love it  a great dram well worth the price always keep a bottle of this in  don t want to rant to much as trying to restrain usual verbosity so straight to the point very nice  should be taken off the shelves minus 5 rating i m no stranger to smoke and peat i ve had and find examples of laphroaig quite agreeable and when i saw my first sight of lagavulin on a bar shelf i was quick to order it the first comments on the smell as the glass arrived at the table were from my family quot woah did you order gasoline quot they were right actually i ve liked smelling gas in a car shop much better than what was in my glass i wasn t sure i even wanted to drink it further whiffs revealed strong formeyldehiyde medicinal qualities that kicked me in the face and corrupted my brain through my nostrils like rotting black magic smelling salts my first sip was a horrid disgusting burn of fetid gasoline and what i can only describe as burnt pork soaked in cheap liquid smoke after reading so many good reviews i m wondering if what was in the bottle was something quite different or off because i don t understand how mine was so different and bad the family jokes about and i will not forget that revolting burnt swine gasoline profile to this day the worst drink i ve ever had negative 5 stars  to all those that say lagavulin 16 tastes bad or like tcp or crap etc face it whisky is not for you maybe some ribena or coke or something along those lines may tickle your fancy whisky is for those who understand and enjoy the finer more elegant things in life if you really have to drink whisky why not try tesco s basics blended scotch whisky very nice indeed for the confused palate  this is simply a beautiful whisky  until i ve tasted my first sip of laga 16 yo it was 15 years ago or even more it s stil the best only a little bit better than other whisky from islay but still first place  i was never a sctoch drinker until i had my first sip of lagavulin i always considered myself to be a bourbon drinker i thought i liked the sweeter flavors that bourbons had to offer much like another reviewer stated though i picked up a bottle on a whim courtesy of my new friend ron swanson kind of an expensive whim but well worth it i took my time with it and really tried to understand it by sipping it slow and trying to appreciate the flavors it had to offer i was blown away i discounted scotches before because i had always tried blended scotches or lower grade highland malts and was turned off by the peat taste big mistake i ve been missing out on so much for a while now i ve been exploring scotches ever since and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite ironically islay malts are by far my favorite despite the considerably stronger smoke peat flavors  if you like peated whisky this is the best in my opinion it is smoother than many and i like that its very well made and i would fully recomend it johnny norfolk i like islay malts i like them all they are like beautiful women each with their own charm this one was the brunette that curls up under your arm in from of the fire and the finish is quite memorable  if you like something a bit different then this is it the moment i opened the bottle i was immediately struck by the smell of something i haven t experienced in years medical plasters hoping i hadn t purchased a dud i persevered and am happy that i did make no mistake the iodine really is pretty powerful at first it reminded me of the doctor s surgery and wasn t sure i wanted to put my lips to the glass however things get better and the complexity of the liquid really comes through with serious amounts of smoke vanilla and some sherry too to my mind it ends up smelling more like being at the seaside but it needs some time the palate is lovely very creamy but also very hot with vanilla and peat you can t deny the medicinal aspect but that s ok the finish is extremely long and very oaky i m currently giving this a 7 10 because it is so quirky and such a shock to the taste buds and yet i know this score will increase over time i m already filling another glass to check i m not missing something and am constantly lifting the bloody thing to my nose really nothing quite like it and this is definitely not for everyone tip if you want to try it but are concerned about not liking it i d recommend picking up a 20cl small enough not to hurt the bank account but enough of a bottle to give the taste buds a good exercise  i just went to bevmo with intent to buy a 50 dollar bottle of a good peaty islay single malt i hadn t tried before they didn t have any so i agreed to get upsold to a bottle of this instead i was very excited to get home and try a sip having now done so i can say it is certainly tasty but i would still actually prefer the laphroaig 10 even if it weren t half the price this whiskey is certainly distinctively islay but so is the laphroaig the laphroaig isn t quite as smooth but it makes up for that in being also quite a bit less bitter smoky doesn t mean bitter the oban 12 i ve had was just as smoky as these two but crazy sweet will i enjoy the rest of this bottle yes i will but i wouldn t buy it again when i could get a bottle of laphroaig 10 for half the price and enjoy it slightly more  what is tcp and how would you know what it tastes like lagavulin was my first islay i always keep coming back to it among the very best malts ever  the first exposure was at deer hunting camp a good friend had my father and i try it whilst my father thought it to be lighter fluid i enjoyed it so much that i purchased a bottle 50 american dollars it did something no bottle has ever done it lasted a year in my cabinet my palate not as sharp as many could taste the depth in each drop literally i would take 10 ml at a time and put a drop on my tongue wonderful explosion of mossy peat smoke although more expensive now i am saving  to me this is a beautiful combination of the peatiness of a good southern islay with the fruity richness and drying finish of a top quality speyside reminds me of the balvenie caribbean cask i have never tasted anything that manages to take such powerful and distinct flavors and balance them without making them taste diluted i could go an entire evening just smelling a dram  always wanted to try this recently acquired the same it was worth the wait amazing on the nose and palate as well don t forget to add dash of water it definitely brings out the best going to savour this will ensure it is always in my cabinet  all you have to do is to look all the commentary on lagavulin 16 yo to understand how popular drink it is when i asked in a tasting which was the first really good single malt that got them exited about them surprisingly many said it was lagavulin not as extreme islay as laphroaig or ardberg but easier to approach with good balance in taste very good first step to the world of islay  i enjoyed the first time i tasted it and i still do after four years of buying it if you re new to islay you re in for a taste that will satisfy you in ways word s can not say  i have never cared much for the smoky peaty scotches it the past until tonight typically i would order a mac 12 or 18 if i was in a scotch mood i have always enjoyed the caramel sherry vanilla and orange flavors the mac brought to the table frankly it s easy to drink a pal of mine by the name of ron swanson led me to the the lag ron has a mustache so i knew it was going to be good scotch so after having 5 of them tonight i have converted this is by far my new favorite scotch quot clear liquor a are for rich women on diets quot ron swanson i had tried it because i wanted to see what a party tasting scotch tasted like so i bought laugh after making my first dram my nose was smelling something that drew my attention then it came time to go for the taste i couldn t believe what i was tasting it was like i was introduced to something i wished i drank sooner than i did i tried other peaty malts but none came close to it i still buy my favorite malt scotch but i will always buy two of these i also buy a bottle when i see it s on sale i now have 14 unopened bottles do you think i am crazy i think not i just want a good supply just in case  and it s fantastic just bought the bottle earlier today and couldn t wait to crack it open the nose took me by surprise with the smokiness and i have to admit the first sip was different but the second was heaven as a speyside fan especially balvenie this was a completely different whisky and i m hooked  i ve been wanting to try this whisky since i ve learned about it i figured since it is about 85 a bottle for the 16 and none of the bars around here have it i would try laphroaig 10 first since it s only 53 and it is also a popular islay neighbor to lagavulin it took awhile to get usedto laphroaig but i learned to love peat and the taste of iodine so lagavulin was like an older sherry finished laphroaig that has had time in the barrel to mature into a focused islay whisky that has some of the medicinal astrigency of an intense islay as well as the body flavor and finish of a world class single malt i still love laphroaig but after a glass you want something kinder like glenkinchie or glenmorangie  complex and firm big body big flavour big finish enormous personality austere in a old genuine way a great experience  complex and firm big body big flavour big finish enormous personality austere in a old genuine way a great experience  lagavulin 16 is possibly the best islay malt i have ever had the pleasure to drink i would probably go as far to say its the best scotch every how anyone can say this sweet peaty honeyish malt is anything less than exceptional is beyond me enjoy it  best of islay best of any peat heavy dram out in the market not as smoky as the likes of laphroaig but perfectly balanced with a fruity background and a burning character soft and mellow 16 years have been enough to tame this beast this is the whisky i would pick for any day of the year any time of the day  i love this bottle two years in a row i found separate bottles fairly consistent and delicious this one is frighteningly easy to drink for something as complex as it is a classic in its own right at this point  if you are trying to experience all the single malts as i have your journey will at some point bring you to lagavulin when your journey ends you will return to lagavulin probably not the whisky most suitable for neophytes it is a rich and full experience with an excellent balance of peat and character having sampled them all lagavulin is expressed in the simplest terms the best  like a whisky should taste and don t ever change it  i had a feeling that it would be impressive due to its price but i was impressed anyway after i took my first sip felt like a luxury banquet of dragon meat bbq with angel tear vodka holy and smoky definitely buy more a lovely lovely dram the smoothest of the three south islay peat monsters but for the price i prefer the laphroaig 10 cask strength batch 3 was something special  i m new to islay malts i read that lagavulin has quot a burnt rubber taste that works quot that made no sense so i decided to try it out for myself i wasn t too sure about it at first but i think i get the quote now it does work very well some drinks will put hair on your chest lagavulin will melt them off  i love lagavulin and blackcurrant the blackcurrant helps the whisky greatly tried lagavulin with dr pepper but the whisky isn t up to scratch  it s like sitting in the smoke of a campfire fueled by peat and oak while sea spray is hitting you in the face a single dram with a few cubes og ice will keep your palate and nose captivated in this world for over an hour  really quot i always mix my dram with irn bru quot why would you think mixing an old expensive scotch with soda would be a good idea these are meant to be savored and enjoyed with a splash of water mabey an ice cube or two what a waste i would reserve scotch an soda for cheaper blended malts just a suggestion  this is laphroaigh mixed with two parts milk  best scotch i ve ever drank wonderful best scotch i ve ever drank wonderful at first the smokey peatiness was slightly over powering but as i added a few drops of water the subtle flavours hidden behind crept through will certainly try again in the near future lagavulin 16 yo used to excellent whisky but in last few years the quality has gone dramatically down i wouldn t bother buying this anymore  i normally discourage the use of caramel but here it not only adds an enchanting beauty to the whisky it also enriches the taste even further this is a whisky that does everything right from the bottle design to the ambrosial taste it leaves in your mouth simply the best islay whisky for its price point  after the old fogeys at my bar have had a couple of the usual g and ts i always pour them a finger or two of lagavulin they go home happy  запах торф вкус очень мягкий можно всю бутылку выпить первое ощущение лимончик дальше очень мягко раскрывается торф translation using google translate smell peat taste very soft you can drink a whole bottle the first sensation lemon then very gently revealed peat  forgot my star ratings so here it is lady is sure dancing with me this whiskey is shear beauty in a bottle never change my troubled mind i give you my heart lagavulin and would miss you so much should you ever hide i guess i need you too much when talking about malts lagavulin who am i to judge you cheers to all who love this magnificant malt one and only i recently bought a bottle of lagavulin 16 and one of ardbeg oogy to see how they compare and although think the oogy just wins the islay stakes by a nose geddit would certainly buy this again in my opinion its slightly smoother than the ardbeg but loses a tiny something in being so id give lagavulin 94 100 and ardbeg 96 100 oops almost forgot  i took my time getting to this pinnacle of scotches and so should you if you are a newbie or just a remedial sm enthusiast i worked my way from clynelish to oban 14 to talisker 10 i would also suggest cao ila 12 also the 14 amp scala 16 along the way and then finely i tried lag it is as good if not better than described by the most glowing reviews above most people s palates do change as they progress i would not suggest jumping right into this cannot say what an experienced bourbon or canadian whiskey drinker might find though when i was very young many years ago i was astonished that adults drank beer it tasted so foul to me and to be certain some of it was but eventually i developed a taste for it and began to understand what i liked and why i liked it it simply takes time  i dont care how much you spend on a bottle of whisky i dont care if theres a 40 year old bottle of something somewhere with superior complexity this is the most delicious scotch whisky i have ever tasted it smells like a bowl of lemon wedges with vanilla right in front of a peat fire tastes almost the same a rich juicy fruit taste that somehow goes so well with a smooth but deep smokiness finish is smokiest aspect leaves you feeling like you ve got something good in your stomach but hair on your chest  an islay legend and frankly a must have a great smoky bear of a whisky with such character and distinction you d really struggle to find better great on miserable days where work or weather bring you low or with smoked fish and cullen skink nose lapsong souchong absolutely spot on rich enveloping peatiness almost heady with tempting notes of exotic spices vanilla and almost smoked paprika powerful but balanced iodine and a sophisticated smack of sherry palate a mighty ship pulling into harbor on a smoky islay morn dense and embracing oak and malt tones with a growling peatiness deftly balanced with a beautiful sweetness of sherry and wholesome fruitiness finish the smoky bear strikes peat and sweetness long with heady oak and vanilla a hint of tar and woven in dried fruit and spice quite extraordinary  taste like earth after rain near to the sea amainzing whisky  i recently started my journey into the wonderful world of scotch single malt whisky as a beginner i started with mostly speyside and highland whisky s like glenmorangie balvenie macallan and dalwhinne then i started to dare myself into island and islay whisky and i am starting to think that there is no going back now so far i have tasted talisker caol ila and lagavulin lagavulin is a fantastic whisky i love it cant wait to taste what else islay have in store for me love from norway after enjoying a bottle of dalwhinnie 15 i tried this whisky a lot of smell a lot of taste a fascinating linger i really like it but it s a lot to think about while trying to relax i still give it high marks but will return to dalwhinnie for my evening reward next stop ardebeg uigeadail  simply beautiful brilliant explodes on the taste buds suspect the bad reviews are from people who will never like heavy peaty scotch so just they should stick to the lighter highland offerings  i forgot to place a personal rating ie is all the fives for above review and for this one smiles all the way with laga 16  sorry for all the folk who can t like laga 16 for whatever reason however it is an icon of all whiskey out there is non other better fact in my opinion i won t go into the nose because if your a humane you will find your own nose explanatiion we are all different but lagavulin 16 is the worlds best sorry there simply is no contest ps please keep in range the price of us ordinary small folk i have seen the price jump to nearly out of my personal range  i m hardly more than a toddler in the whisky world but what i have discovered is i love islays they are not for everyone because of the strong complexity heavy peat and smokiness some of my friends who have always raved about various laphroaig varieties have come to realize the long lasting finish of lagavulin 16 it s greater variation of flavors with each sip and the soothing smokiness like most fine drinks lagavulin 16 is best shared with good company after dinner some like it with one ice cube others 3 or 4 cubes still others will say you need a drop of water i prefer it neat just pour a little in the glass breathe it in and sip for an hour or so  it really is hard to beat this whiskey this was the first single malt i tried and i thoroughly enjoyed it from the first taste it s very reminiscent of a cold winter s night beside a peat fire very earthy and yet has a subtle sweetness the wonderful smokiness lingers for a very long time  they didn t have the laga distillers edition which i was looking for an awesome dram so i opted to finally try the 16 and wow what a whiskey i m new to the islay whiskeys so i m not especially into the peat and smoke monsters but i must admit this is really good the sherry influence is way in the background but it s there top class and quite addicting this one a shade under 5 stars buy it and try it  drink taste and save the experience it does not any better than this as a whiskey drinker of over 30 years you will find that all your taste buds will sing for hours after you have drank this wonderful single malt initially the smokiness of the open peat flame is overbearing not for the novice whiskey drinker then when you get accustomed to the smoke the smooth underlying character caresses you and treats you to hard islay the 16yo wood is tasted and has a beautiful intrusiveness fruit finish a favorite for special occasions but not everyday  i had my first shot of wiskey few months ago i bought lagavulin just for the color the first taste of it was so incredible and stunning i tried few different wiskey but lagavulin it s the best  i am always keen to try new malts and decided to give lagavulin a go i always mix my dram with irn bru but i found that this whisky just doesn t mix with it at all never mind i did try it and will put it down to a learning curve i m sure there are much better malts out there james mcworthy i first came upon this whiskey when at the age of 18 i worked in my uncles off licence and wanted to buy my girlfriends father a nice drink my uncle gave me a second bottle for an extra 163 20 so i got one for me too btw this was the first whiskey i had ever bought outside of tasting a house whiskey in a social club which as you can imagine did not go down well i had my first taste of it with her dad he was a big whiskey fan but had never tried it it was heaven since then i m now 30 i have probably had maybe 100 bottles of this 16 yr old and maybe 15 20 of the cask strength 12 yr old i have just recieved lagavulin 21 year old 2012 special release as a christmas present from my fiancee which i am planning on cracking open this coming friday i have made it my business to try as many different whiskeys as i possibly could and have been on 7 whiskey tasting holiday packages to broaden my knowledge a little bit but i can hand on heart claim that the greatest i have ever tasted is this 16 yr old lagga a close second being its stronger 12 yr old brother i will let you guys know once i have tried my 21 yr old  i m fairly new into scotch but still worst i ve had i couldn t believe afterwards they charged me 16 an ounce must have been a bad batch or something no way it can taste that bad i m serious i nosed it for probably 10 minutes in disbelief i am going to by a bottle to give it a fair chance for now i am disappointed  this is the worst scotch i ve ever had 16 for one ouce that s pathetic i ve only tried it once maybe it was a bad batch but that was terrible seriously never drink this scotch tastes like crap and it d kill myself before having having another sip  an example of a scotch that even experienced home distillers attempt to emulate admittedly this scotch is of primary appeal for island scotch region lovers and or those with dare to be different tastes however it is an enjoyably complex well fractioned and aged top class scotch and the price is always amazing for such crafted single malt  not as peaty as laphroiag but serious nonetheless this is an awesome dram not that easy to come by in the high street and very much the mature whisky lovers choice theres no point talking about noses palates or anything else just buy a bottle and see for yourself you will not be disappointed disclaimer if you are disappointed stop drinking scottish single malts and stick to cheap vodka  having found my taste for scottish single malts i must say even though they say irish whiskey may be the oldest this doesn t mean its the best this dram will leave your taste buds with a smokey mellow peat taste to savour this is a dram that should be drank slowly with some friends  i drink old shot whiskey recommended in my opinion i like  this was my first whisky love and no matter what my other current favorites may be i ll always stay with lagavulin i have always drink this one as my favourite and i should start thinking about moving on to another brand because the quality of this one particularly it decreasing every year i rate it 91 100 the older version  i discovered lagavulin in the 90 s and it has been my favorite ever also like caol ila laphroaig and bowmore great to drink with a nice cuban cigar and some good friends lagavulin is my top choice from islay and one of my favourite whiskies overall an incredibly strong peat monster with one of the best finishes out of all whiskies  the very best single malt ever laphroiag follows  i first tasted this single malt on a trip to st andrews in 2004 and i was totally amazed by it this is truly what great single malt taste like wonderful earthy peat smell and flavor with a hint of sweetness everytime i take a sip it takes me back to scotland  in my price range up to 40 a bottle this is by far and away the best single malt i have ever had the pleasure to taste i can t describe how fulfilling it is without a doubt the best i have ever tasted and i assure you there have been many this is miles and miles above anything else if you want to venture into silly prices for good whisky try this first and i m english so what do i know eh  being an islay fan this is one of the best examples of an islay dram it is silky smooth on the palate with what i got as sharp citrus flavours too the only reason it does not get 5 stars is the finish was a little harsh compared to my favourite islay caol ila but that is personal opinion  tastes simply like tcp  tried a sample of this at the glenkinchie distillery and bought myself a bottle more balanced than many islay drams with the peat smoke feeling more like a part of the flavour than hitting you in the face  my favourite of all whiskies then talisker then laphroaig  i had this while in a nice restaurant with a dozen friends the nose is incredible and powerful people could smell it way down the table each sip almost feels like liquid velvet  out of bruinladdich laphroiag laph qcask jura talisker lediag highland park and few more its prob my all time favourite smooth peaty smokey currently testing jura 16year old really nice but not as good as lagavulin  a wonderfully rich flavour gorgeous  lagavulin simply the best  this is my favorite islay malt highly recommended five ice cubes into a tumbler fill with lagavulin till you ve covered the lower three cubes place on table go to kitchen get slice of smoked salmon squeeze lemon on top take bite take slip of lagavulin heaven the best whiskey out there in my opinion have tried many single malts and this is the one that i call the king a whisky for all seasons and times best greatings from carinthia austria  i love whisky but this one just taste of tcp to me and i was saveing it for ages as said above this is unbeatable a superlative rich malt with an unmistakable aroma alex w simply the very best i have ever tasted  simply the best dram out there from the smoky sweet nose to the almost milky salt honey smoke taste unbeatable 100 points  some of you may think that my whisky palate has not advanced enough yet however i can only say it how i find it and i will be honest i do not find this whiskey enjoyable i m obviously just not an islay whisky fan if you have not tried this whisky before i recommend you go for the sample first  my favorite bedtime scotch a blast of taste and nose one of the older peated whisky powerfull but with balance  this is really great whisky for me its the best islay whsiky ardbeg uigeadail is close but not close enough  this is a great starter islay but it is too monotone sweet and smooth for my palate it has a lot of class but is a bit of an old smoothy lacks that briny hit that salt medicinal astringency too sweet and cloying like grandma s sherry treat yourself to a bruichladdich waves or ardbeg 10 instead  my introduction to single malts and still by a nose my favorite it is islay in a bottle peaty complex yet eminently drinkable this is the yardstick to measure the wonders of the ardbegs the succulence of caol ila the earthy roughness of laphaoig and the subtle pleasure of talisker if god made anything better he kept it for himself  at some stage in your journey through single malts you will try lagavulin it is an experience like no other after tasting lagga the rest have to be very good whiskies to remain in the memory smoke peat rich with tastes of the islay salt it is quite simply unique and treasured amongst single malts worth every penny  always have this at my local so thought i d buy a bottle smokey rich still sweet though just great balance love it from brian 
1721.0, ardbeg tenas you open this bottle for the first time you conjure up thoughts of that hallowed peaty profile you pour a little after a nice pop and draw yourself to the top of the glen trying to take in the first whiff boom you are standing near a salty water body maybe an ocean whipping against large and small black rocks but it s night and you can t see very far in the ocean there s a small fire behind you meat and a few more essential fats largely exaggerated stories told by the pack of pals you willingly don t let go and some bacon are being slowly turned over these flames and you can smell the promise of smoky succulent and almost sweet deliciousness the air is kind of rare neutral and though the night is not cold the fire gives out a familiar warmth you go in again bringing it up for another whiff and a taste the earthiness pops up and makes you feel the peated edges beneath your feet and then it carries you to another zone the room now is a old regal leather amp wood covered library the high back chesterfield is overused and more beautiful than before the leather bound books have been resting well but the oiliness creeps in through your nostrils and reaches your taste buds it s sharp and you feel like you bit into something unique it s fresh with its crispness yet familiar with its varnish like feel the wooden racks on the wall are now smiling back at you hinting at how they blended the leather wraps of the book with their faded inner oak you take in a little more excited for it unravel new chapters it stops where did it go i can t feel it behind my throat just the hum of milk soaked cereal after it s gone the nose plunges again the smoky meaty umami is still there and it s promising a more delicate and warm note ahead what could it be a little liquorice a whole lot of warming spices maybe but it s also that kind of deep clove infused aqua that i have sometimes it s sweet and warm at the same time it s wonderful how i have been traversing expansive spots just to land in my easychair with this smoke laden sweet oaky and warm clove steeped liquid in hand a journey indeed as this opens up more within that air in my house it introduces itself as a light pale coloured friend who has many more stories to tell as we go deeper into conversations but for the moment it urges me to fill my glass again for a few more escapades  of the big three i think this may be my favourite lagavulin is fab of course but a bit of a show off laphroaig is too hospitally but this is the perfect compromise very nice less blood and guts and less blood and guts perfect  taste is very subjective i haven 39 t been able to ignore how disappointing this drop is medicinal peaty smoke char i do not understand the appeal at all there seems to be a challenge in accepting the flavours of this whisky that i 39 ll never overcome and gladly so  about 10 years ago the first of the new 10yo came out and i was bereft their was a hole where my heart used to be as they 39 d killed my favourite whisky by taming it whatever this is it 39 s not ardbeg but a sanitised facsimile to taste ardbeg as it was you 39 ll need to buy uigeadail which is amazing i 39 m sure objectively this is nice but all i can taste is loss regret and pain  spiffing fairly recent scotch drinker and even more recently moved into the peated whiskys ardbeg 10 was my first islay scotch was a bit uncertain after the first dram quite the shock to the taste buds but has this ever grown on me now about 2 3 through the bottle and i actually crave the smell and taste do they add something addictive have recenty done direct comparison with laphroaig 10 and lagavulin 8 and can say that arbeg is my clear favourite love the strong and clean smokey and earthy flavours unfortunately it 39 s over 100 a bottle here in western canada 40 higher than laph 10 so sadly may not become my daily sipper  a delicious drop from islay surf and turf served up by the sea delicious bbq notes with sweet citrus in the back yes please  i 39 m just sipping this for the first time after being a huge talisker 10 amp laphroaig 10 lover i am literally in love with this my go to bottle has always been my talisker the laphroaig is gorgeous but not quite powerful enough for me but now this the nose is a gorgeous blend of medicinal smoke when vanilla and moorland comes through then the taste smoke fire bitter sweet pepper sea salt but the best is yet to come the finish is so long first heat and pepper but then that wild grass and fells again damn it i will now have to permanently have a bottle of this keeping my talisker 10 company if you like peaty smoke but with much more complexity to enjoy go but this bottle  having been essentially a supermarket whisky drinker until now this is a different class wow i can t look back in anger at least not today ok i m not a connoisseur but this is the best whisky i ve ever tasted for me this has sublime smokiness subtle sweetness and soup 231 on of saltiness seriously it s superb xx an absolute favorite of mine citrusy and smoky ardbeg 39 s flagship bottle the ten delivers a near perfect dram every pour obviously highly recommend  but you have to like smoke if pushed i will buy corryvreckan i like that one best ardbeg 10 is outstanding if you 39 re in the mood for smoke  fantastic slow drinker with beautiful smoky aroma and peat taste by far one of the finest i 39 ve had recently  i am a huge fan of islay whiskies the laphroaig 10 yr old cask strength being one of my favourites and this one doesn 39 t disappoint massive peatiness as expected with what i can only describe as a slightly medicinal aftertaste which i adore stunning  strong flavoured i find it needs dash of water opens up more flavour and takes away strong spicy harshness after taste lagavulin best islay for me nose firstly an absolute mountain of peat then a touch of marzipan more so with a drop of water sweet vanilla and a burst of salty spray palate sweet smooth mouth feel vanilla notes with a smokey back ground then a twang of burnt grass followed by that surging warmth from the alcohol finish long glorious sea salted strong peated smoke with hints of toffee or caramel absolutely divine overall being new to the whisky world im learning thick and fast this is an absolute stunner of a whisky stronger than most with an unmistakable punch from the peat theres a lingering sweetness to counter balance the heavy smoke and the pale yellow colour makes this dram look deceptively weaker tham it is what a journey ardbeg have put me on domt miss out on this glorious dram  smoke lemon and salty liquorice this one is custom made for my tastebuds  simply superb sweetness with a hint of salt and lovely smoke 5 stars all the way  peaty and complex flavours remind me of dark chocolate and burnt sugar a dash of water brings them out more good as an after dinner whisky or as a contrast after drinking something smoother and more rounded  a beginner getting into whisky this is my first islay whisky i was blown away by the smokey flavour the first sips i felt tasted too peaty but it really mellows and and almost to easy to drink if this is a prime islay whisky then i 39 m going to enjoy my trip through this islands whisky 39 s  super smoky stuff quite good for the price and superb as an entry level beginner 39 s whisky let 39 s see what islay is all about nuts charcoal and vague oak honey on the nose bbqie peat on the tongue with hints of vanilla and cured meat little sour even it is kind of flat though so for more seasoned taste buds this might come out as a small disappointment but still under 40 i mean that 39 s the same price as big peat c 39 mon man 4 5 5 for the price 3 5 regardless of price  one for a cold day sitting by the fire a peat fire in a glass balanced with the sweet notes of vanilla cut pleasingly with citrus oh the lingering smokey aftertaste is one to remember  must try if you like peated whiskys intense long lasting flavour which is very pleasing for a 10 year scotch a subtle sweetness behind the smoke and green spices smell your glass the day after and you ll recognize it s beautiful corethe aftertaste lingers on  if you like an islay and you like your peat this is the one rounded and balanced you get what you pay for blows laphroaig 10 into the seaweed beautiful  huge amounts of smoke and fire in the belly a great whiskey to go with a mild cigar it is less refined then the og lagavulin 16 ardbeg is a bit of a brute flavors are immediately in your face and powerful but man it is great and so worth it as a budget smoky peaty dram  smelled like charcoal and tasted like eating a piece of burnt dirt with the ending note of fire in the gut burned in the mouth in the throat and in the stomach flavors linger way to long id rather drink something that isnt painful a proper salty jack tar of a dram very very consistent powerful and complex superbly balanced but i simply don 39 t like drinking something that tastes like skin ointment disgusting i can imagine why people can admire it but i can 39 t imagine why they derive pleasure from the taste if you haven 39 t tried peated whisky before then get a sample first not a full bottle  if laphroaig is an ashtray this guy is a smoke pit after a bbq festival if your in for the smokey ride this bad boy will deliver one of my favorites  i love the stuff well priced in sa and in my humble opinion more interesting that lagavulin which although excellent has become a little generic  too much harsh smoke for me with little supporting flavours needs more sweet and saline flavour to balance out the intense smoke  burnt marshmallow s mores burnt sugar evolving into honey grahams with a lingering aftertaste of dark chocolate a drop of water accentuates the sweetness  the best i ve had in recent years a unique aroma that conquers persistent on the palate just in its description i will buy it again and share it with friends lovely firey old school islay whisky one of my favorites good price too buy it it 39 s only been 2 days but i had to come back this isn 39 t whisky it doesn 39 t even have any oak esque tastes to it i 39 m sat with a lagavulin 16 directly after an ardbeg 10 and i 39 m just so confused as it simply isn 39 t even close to tasting like whisky it really just tastes like earthy smokey ethanol  it 39 s nice but in all honesty it just tastes like peated vodka i don 39 t get any whisky type flavours other than smoke and ethanol no toffee no oak no whisky vibes at all ledaig 10 smashes this out the park for a peated whisky that has all the tastes of whisky i 39 d of recommended lagavulin but that tripe is added colour and chill filtered mainly because of its rubbish owners diageo every single whisky brand they own tastes sweetened and has that added caramel tastes funk ledaig 10 is better actually smokey monkey almost beats this  big punchy peated sea spray on nose smoky fruity heather on palate and liqurice finish great value of 163 37 best islay by far  everyone knows this is a cracker if you don t like peat and smoke or buy it not knowing the characteristics of this type of islay malt you ll hate it but otherwise it s the undisputed cheap peaty monster king personally i am a big fan of the laphraoig 10 but this delivers the peat so much better i ve knocked off half a star for the high price compared to other ten year olds  my first love was laphroaig qc and anything i 180 ve tasted after it came close to it if we speak about islay even lagavullin 16 which is a truly great whisky didn 180 t meet my expectations it 180 s too sherry like and sophisticated for me but this ardbeg 10 is an exception this differs much from the qc but in a good way it 180 s simply delicious at first i thought that there 180 s even too much richness in it but now after a few drams every element of it settles down in a very very balanced way really incredible for a whisky in this price class very rich smooth and balanced and still burning it lacks nothing truly a great islay whisky  i am not a regular drinker usually go for rye amp coke rye amp ginger or recently rum amp coke i tried my son 39 s tecent purchase of ardbeg 10 and fell in love with it 39 s flavour while he almost regrets buying it because he finds it wierd tasting he is going to try and mix it my wife finds it tastes amp smells awful but after the first couple of tastes i fell in love with this scotch i have been converted over to scotch i have found something worth drinking  not bad but not as good as the laphroaig staples like the lap 10 and qc  aromatic   this early 2020 late 2019 bottling is quite a bit nuttier and saltier than the bottle i had last in the early spring of 2018 a bottling which was slightly sweeter and more vanilla forward let me say that the ardbeg 10 is at its core a distinctly refined and nuanced dram not a 39 dirty 39 ill tempered one and one with a great amount of soft subtlety but i am relishing the more teeth clenching tenacity on display at present very nice thank you  this whiskey was a bit too hot and smokey for me i 39 m typically an irish whisky drinker so i was a bit surprised when i poured myself a drink if you 39 re into the medicinal and burnt wood taste this is a whisky for you i 39 ll stick with my good old friend redbreast 12  reputed to be mermaid s bath water more like a smoky slap in the face tempered by a siren s kiss balanced  i 39 m very particular about what i drink as not many agree with me this fine single malt leaves me feeling calm and stimulated a warming dram of ethereal perfection a delightful and refined meditative experience on a cold winter 39 s evening  if you like a strong scotch with intense peat smoke and medicinal notes this one is perfect great price for this amazing stuff  for my surprise this whisky didnt blow my socks off is not very complex and the peat is not that strong for me caol ila 12 had more peat and a better flavor profile but hey is an education  my good friend introduced me to this last night and i felt compelled enough to look up a comments thread to see if it was just me nothing else i 39 ve tried compares there 39 s no going back moreover there is no point in going back either perhaps i ought to refrain from saying that i do not want to ever get used to this whisky so will still take others just to fill in and make ardbeg my very special treat  brilliant scotch new to scotch start with this not a so called beginner s dram which will make you think the stuff is bad or boring i ve been drinking scotch since about 1975 take it from me you will like this sweet smoke peat and more  superb peated scotch that first sip you feel the fire then the smoke followed by the ashy embers then the kick in the finish is like nothing else i have tried many single malts over the last 20 years and nothing else comes close to ardbeg 10yo slainte  tastes like the decaying corpse of an irish sea fisherman freshly exhumed from his peat bog grave and i love it  for those who savour the heavily peated south coast islay malts this is a must for your collection i 39 m a big fan of laphroaig especially the cask strength and lagavulin 16 but pound for pound this ardbeg 10 46 and non chillfiltered is the business yes the laphroaig 10 is probably still more 39 in your face 39 peaty and the laga 16 is probably more subtle but i think it 39 s losing ground with its 43 and chillfiltered but this ardbeg has such a deft balance of peat smoke meat and sweetness the finish is so long you 39 ll still be tasting it the next morning  excellent balance and loaded with peat this one stands up well with a few drops of water a little sweetness is detectable but for me it 39 s just right not for the faint of heart but a longtime favorite of mine  after drinking uigeadail and corryvreckan i finally got round to opening the bottle of ardbeg 10 year old i ve had in the cupboard it s superb smokey and peaty with a hint of sea salt it s complex with a long finish and a great mouth feel i like it better neat but a splash of water would probably make it a little less challenging i was always a laphroaig fan but this beats it hands down now for me as the entry level cooking ardbeg it s a phenomenal drink  at the price this is one of my favourite islay drams think of laphroaig 10 but peaty instead of smoky also a bit more refined and a little sweeter but not sweet overall a few drops of water bring out more flavour nuances and it also benefits from a bit of rest after pouring will always keep a bottle on my scotch shelf however it is not a beginner 39 s dram by any means and can be overwhelming if used as an introduction to islay whiskies ps an even better version of this also more expensive is the uigeadail worth tasting at least before making it a permanent presence in your booze bunker  this is the one that sealed the deal after tasting this whiskey i knew there was no going back  one of my favourite peated whiskies it 39 s not all about the smoke as it 39 s got lots of character too and is full bodied if you want a good introduction to peated whiskey then this is the one  was apprehensive about trying this since it 39 s my first scotch but i was hooked pretty quickly like drinking charred wood and smoked meat love it  ardbeg 10 leaves a special lining in your pallet a long while it 39 s the only whiskey i crave and cannot find anything else as enjoyable  while laphroaig has been described as a quot big peaty punch in the face quot ardbeg would best be likened to a deep smokey sensual kiss followed by passionate peat infused lovemaking heed the warnings though and do not over indulge in this pale vixen or you will suffer for it  very average islay whisky too sweet for me kilchoman much better  this is a great whisky and at 46 you can add a splash of water to make it sing unapologetically peaty it 39 s a dram to savour not for everyone but worth getting to know  i like smokey and complexe flavoured whisky at start strong in your mouth and with a prolonged finish its smokiness roughness and sweet salty flavor transport us to a scenario of hard working men in rough windy conditions near the sea giving this whisky their souls  on the nose agressivelly peaty and smoky with distinct vanilla and oakiness some complex aromas can be noted such as faint fruitiness on the palate it is fullbodied briny and still smoky from intense peatiness water addition intensifies sweetness aftertaste is long and still smoky  one of my favorites one i love the peat smoke flavor expression in a scotch and ardbeg is my favorite brand along those lines within the brand uigeadail stands as my ultimate variety of choice but is not an everyday dram for me at its typical price point that 39 s where the ardbeg 10 year comes in for my tastes and wallet it 39 s about as close to an ideal baseline islay as i can find just a lovely drink that allows me to experience all of my favorite scotch pleasures whenever i desire them always sipped neat with two drops of spring water and about ten minutes to open up a bit a masterpiece of both flavor and value  this is my go to scotch i could drink this everyday great price complexity and smoke ardbeg is one of my favorite distilleries along side springbank and are one of the few that offer great scotch ncf no artificial coloring and a higher abv all at a reasonable price  yes heavily peated malts are not for everyone because everyones tastebuds aren 39 t either developed enough or capable of appreciating the hammer blast of peaty smoky flavour this delivers really some people cannot actually taste certain things never mind being able to discern complexity i started my whisk e y drinking with the occasional cheap ish bourbon and then moved onto single malts by my early twenties always neat i remember gagging at what i then thought was the repulsive taste of laphroaig thankfully my taste has evolved allot in the last ten years like from amoeba to homo sapiens and i 39 ve had the privilege of drinking some of the best regarded whiskies and cognacs like fine wine whisk e y has its categories in this case peaty scotch ardbeg is undoubtedly the best of its kind anyone who says otherwise isn 39 t experienced enough or is just incapable of discerning its complexity this whisky is truly outstanding and testament to how amazing and varied the world of whisky is its also worth mentioning that compared to other categories of single malt whisky ardbeg ten is also exceptional value you are getting the best of its kind for a very approachable 163 40 a bottle  wonderful peat no shortage of that but still balanced enough and complex to be quite enjoyable if i ve had a bourbon and it was too sweet at the time a dram of this cuts the nonsense and brings back the palate very enjoyable  i absolutely love this whisky can t put into words myself the complexity that all the other reviews describe but as i read and drink a lot of it rings true whisky drinking just evolves what you once will dislike you will eventually love just enjoy the journey don t jump in the deep end you have time  if you like smoky islay whiskies then this is for you although i d be surprised if you hadn t tried it already not got the iodine of laphroaig and not as complex as lagavulin 16 i was surprised to find it more smoky than the latter citrus on the nose and vanilla in the mouth at first then the peat takes over and dominates and oh boy does it linger it s a lovely dram and will be my go to for islay whiskies from now on if you find yourself taking long country walks in the autumn then this is the whisky to put in your hip flask  my favourite islay whisky sad to see my current bottle almost running dry will be re stocking  nose oh the smoke the smoke quot i love the intense smell of campfire in the morning quot a hint of lemon palate oily and smooth just a bit of caramel long lasting  this is outstanding paired with a steak dinner absolutely amazing a few strokes of vanilla mist followed by a short lived wave of citrus excitement then a peaty mouth orgasm the size of a tsunami this scotch dwarfs the taste and complexity of highland park 12 year old seriously a must try  tastes bitter and of burnt peat coal tar  what an incredible single malt scotch it is fascinating how mild the nose is on this dram considering what we are about to taste you do get the smoke and peat on the nose but with a decent amount of floral tones there is also an amazing amount of phenols in ardbeg which comes to life on your tongue smoke peat and that non chill filtered oily feel reacting immediately as you taste it they stay alive the whole time they are rolling around on the finish the smoke and peat is of course just as notable with a stage of leather and those floral notes you had on the nose finished by a almost mint sensation to be honest there are much more to this dram so you need to come back to it several times and discover new notes yes this is a really smoky and peaty scotch but it is so very well balanced and has a lot to offer it doesn 39 t hold back anything else i 39 d say it is smoke done right if you like that this is a must have on the shelf one of the pillars of islay peaty single malts  for me its simple ardbeg 10 is one of the best bottles of whisky for 163 40 or under smoke and peat in abundance as you would expect but plenty of other flavours going on to surprise try the slightly saltier an oa if you like it a little lighter in the smoke  smokey and salty taste is very complex with the hints of salty and citrucy nuances peat is so pleasant on the palate it lasts surprisingly long it is easy to see why professional testers call it dream of whisky lovers  just the best  laphroaig 39 s big brother more depth in the taste saved mine for special occasions  the peatiness is not a surprise the citrus amp honey very much is add a drop and i mean a drop of water for a satisfying experience  you 39 re not gonna get much better than this if you like a young islay laphroaig 10 is the benchmark ardbeg 10 is the over achiever  bought my firstborn bottle today amazing first true prayed scotch i ve had and love it the smoke lingers on the palate long after drink neat ice would ruin the experience for sure not my last bottle  good whisky for the money smokey and pleasant do not compare it with lagavulin 16 which is far more complex i mean it is good but that 39 s it  the packaging gives you a insightful detail of the dram strong on the noise with good peat and great smoky flavour it tastes sweeter than i would have like sting vanilla taste and some liquorice tastes once in the month not as peaty as ledaig 10 still a 5 stars quality  simply wonderful god send us this marvelous drink huge  not for me i guess my palate is not refined enough got a bottle as a gift tried it and gave it away  i bought a bottle at the grocery here in america for 45 dollars quite good i have tried scotch from all the big distilleries in islay this one is solid if i 39 m being greedy i 39 d say they could up the abv on this and it might pop a bit more for more pop try laphroaig this ardbeg goes down easy though  each dram a special event it need time and the peat canact the barrier to some but bravery pay off big time a marvelous sipper a  bound to divide opinion no sitting on the fence with this one almost certainly an acquired taste  very nice to see such a light whisky not being coloured the vanilla and citrus tang isn 39 t something to write home about in and on itself but the smoke following soon after is among the most complex i 39 ve ever tasted although superior to laproigh it is also quite a bit more expensive to be honest for the money i 39 d rather buy a glenglassaugh peated portwood if i 39 d be looking for something peaty  boasts the smokey sweet flavor typical of the islay expressions with a remarkable smoothness and complexity bar none  the only whisky i will drink i may be a snob but i 39 m a happy one concentrated but very soft peat big vanilla a world of subtle complexities the connoisseur 39 s single malt 5 5 g c  very rich and smokey not to be drunk after a light highland or speyside as very contrasting enjoyable slowly and on its own but a strong and possibly acquired taste similar to the uigeadail to be honest but a little less smooth if you enjoy one you 39 ll enjoy the other  love it so smokey you don 39 t need a bonfire  tastes like linement filtered through old band aids awful  i 39 ve had a couple of ardbeg 39 s other bottlings uigeadail corryvreckan and they 39 re both mysterious and fascinating in their own ways lagavulin drips with history and authority laphroaig is approachable and fun in cocktails ardbeg 10 is for me is the simple perfection of scotch 39 s most essential flavors peat malt sea salt iodine earth there 39 s nothing extraneous the flavor is leaner than any other islay scotch but it 39 s perfectly balanced it 39 s my favorite scotch and thus my favorite whisky and thus my favorite booze in the world it 39 s an extremely dry scotch almost bone dry and it 39 s the color of pale straw it tastes like peat smoke and mineral rich earth beaten by the cold atlantic its taste is more evocative than any other whisky i imagine myself in cold scotland under a cloudy sky laphroaig tastes like a campfire rounded out by oak and a mild sweetness lagavulin tastes like a peat fire in an ancient library full of old books ardbeg tastes like peat and the ocean perfection it 39 s the standard against which i judge every other whisky  a very special scotch single malt no colouring nor chill filtering enjoyed the peatiness and fragrance that lingers on in the glass after i finish the drink unlike the laphroaig there is no antiseptic smell just pleasantness ｎｅｅｄｓ ｔｏ ｏｐｅｎ ｕｐ ｇｉｖｅ ｉｔ ｔｉｍｅ ａｎｄ ａ ｂｉｔ ｏｆ ｗａｔｅｒ

february 21st guy who does notice he misspelled the word 39 smoky 39  more feminine and elegant than laphroaig or lagavulin i like it but i find myself craving the more brawny bodacious nature of the other two particularly laphroaig 39 s thick wall of smoke i am definitely a smoke fiend and the more the better  for peated dams honestly you can 39 t get much better in my book a special whisky for me i love it  there is nothing i can add over and above what others have said about the nose and taste this whisky is a gem of gems and has been consistently excellent for many years i 39 ve had many ardbeg expressions but this is still my favorite overall   120367 120362 120356 120358 120365 120378 120356 120368 120367 120356 120358 120367 120373 120371 120354 120373 120358 120357 120356 120368

shoes and jackets new car smell taste lemon pound cake a hint of medium dark chocolate way in the background say about 55 cocoa quite prominent vanilla icing sugar i do get a whiff of cappuccino here at least in an empty glass post dramming but it 39 s very slight faint saline smoke some malt smoke distinct aroma of east caribbean rums especially out of the bottle perfume like aromatic minimal oak mellow complex very refined very luxurious this is a vegetal peaty malt not a smokey one sapid but soft friendly reviewed with 1 teaspoon of water  i will always have a bottle of this in my whisky cabinet like its neighbours lagavulin and laphroaig this is a peat bruiser but has multi faceted notes of brine tobacco lime oysters tar smoke and an intense salty tang which is just so addictive i have had the good fortune to visit the distillery many times and drink this dram there unique and powerful in a good way  to my taste ardbeg lives at the end of the peaty scotch spectrum that s the burning burnt hellfire end where nose and tongue wrinkle and curl but i like it it s a startling taste of power and fiery finish but my favotite is still lagavulin smooth subtle sweet refined  the classic 10 year old gemstone buy it  heavily peated malts are not for everyone it 39 s not a matter of experience or sophisticated taste some people will never like it others just instantly like it even without being a malt geek popularity of johnnie walker and teacher 39 s comes to mind it 39 s absurd to insist that this is a quot must have scotch quot must have if you are into peated malts yes but millions of cognac and bourbon drinkers do fine without peat as do millions of unpeated scotch drinkers now that doesn 39 t mean that these are bad they are designed to be exactly what they are because that 39 s what some people love sadly these disappointed reviews from clueless newbs drown out the more important reviews from those who remember this expression being better now that 39 s concerning i bought my first bottle of ardbeg 10 on ralfy 39 s recommendation having tasted lagavulin 16 and liked it i was taken aback at first it was shockingly phenolic like ichtammol ointment i figured i 39 ll add a drop of it to a sweet malt until i learn to like it yet strong peat has a strangely addictive moreish attraction i still prefer lagavulin 16 and other sweeter expressions like ardbeg uigeadail and corryvreckan and the lighter caol ila 12 i also like the less peated highland park 12 and i prefer ardbeg 10 to laphroaig 10 because of 46 abv no chill filtration and no added caramel laphroaig has green bottles why do they care how dark their whisky is peat diminishes with maturation so younger expressions will be more phenolic i have a bottle of lagavulin 8 stashed waiting for a special session if it 39 s too much try adding a few drops of drambuie preferably the 15 year old malt based version to it sweetness balances out the phenols imo or try adding a few drops of ardbeg 10 to your preferred unpeated malts  i have been looking through the negative reviews and i have to say if folks do not like peated whisky in general don 39 t fault the whisky and give it a poor score this is a fine whisky nice peat flavor good mouth feel and long finish  i love the balance of peat and smoke it 39 s way better than talisker 10 and i think more intriguing than laphroaig 10 my introduction to islay was lagavulin about 20 years ago and never looked back i prefer this ardbeg over the lagavulun i 39 ve just bought a corry and oogie taster pack i suspect i 39 m going to be jettisoned to the moon  very good islay a bit harsher on the tongue than laphroig no where near the lagavulin 16  had a dram in a bar and decided to buy a bottle even more enjoyable than i remembered love the brine and dare i say formaldehyde was a biology student so know the profile plenty of tobacco to go along with the peat i find this less intense than i thought it 39 d be have been drinking a 12 year double casked caramely aberlour and a very elegant glenmorangie of late the ardbeg is rounding out my cabinet nicely  for me the ardbeg 10 is a reference for comparing other peated whiskys make sure to always have one at home  first time trying a peaty whiskey not my cup of whiskey the smokiness is overwhelming  nose earthy peat smoke and briny like seaside campfire palate sweetness and iodine comes first with oiliness then the peat smoke with oakiness slowly rises and intensified which makes you 39 wow 39 like dampen burnt wood finish still peat smoke long and spectacular overall a very bold complete and full bodied whisky it 39 s all about peatiness but well complimented by brine oak and sweetness  after trying the more honeyed and gentle speysides and highland malts you may feel the tug of the peaty smoky drams from islay this from ardbeg is a no compromise version and one of the most balanced and fulfilling whiskys to be had at the price  am i the only one who get 39 s some pretty heavy black pepper in the finish especially  this is for the pat lovers only not me while i have had peated whisky in the past this one is very different to sum it up look that the heading of this review  lol to the guy who 39 s been drinking whisky for 3 years and quot sweet quot whisky at that any scotch fan would be doing him or her self a disservice to not try one of islay 39 s finest this is such a smoker brine y well done 10 year i prefer it over laphraoig at times but maybe not as refined as lagavulin but a great 10 year that is a must have try whoever told the sweet whisky probably drinks fireball guy that this is a must try is right hope he expands that quot palate quot of his lmao seriously if you don 39 t like the whiff of phenolics then why even try a peated malt let alone a monster like this from islay to those reviewers pouring it down the sink you really need to research it before spending any serious money the variation in signature flavours across the regions are huge and not to be underestimated so the negative reviews are mostly because the palate does not like the signature smoke and peat and not because this is a poor whisky it 39 s not it 39 s a member of some if the greatest examples if the genre  i am sorry i am drinking whisky for about 3 years now i am into the sherried and sweet whiskys they told me that this is a must for any whisky lover but i disagree it is so intens smoky for someone who never drinks peaty whisky it sure be a great whisky but i cant get this down disgusting haha  i was hesistant to go for something i knew would be quite different to what i 39 d had before with this one as i 39 d hitherto stuck mostly to the speyside malts my more experienced friends recommended i am quite new to whisky i picked ardbeg as it was clearly going to be very different i 39 ll admit i bounced off of this one the first time i tried it the initial pour made it clear i was in for something strong when all i could smell was smoke i tasted smoke rubber and cheese not a great start but i appreciate that some things require you to come to them before you really get all they can offer a couple of sessions later and this one has rocketed near the top of my limited set of faourite whiskys once you adjust to the massive smoke peat punch there 39 s quite a lot to taste the nose still hits me as pure smoke with some sea smell brine salt but the taste reminds me of apples pears more salt and something sharp the finish lasts for a good while the smoke still leading the way though i even think of chocolate and lemons sometimes ardbeg like most of the islay malts i imagine will probably clarify whether you enjoy peat smoke taking the lead in your whisky if you 39 re new to this spirit or haven 39 t tried this type yet just be aware of that you 39 ll smell smoke in your glass and taste it on your tongue it 39 s the embodiment of autumn air when everyone 39 s got log fires going once you 39 re used to the smoke i 39 d say there 39 s more fruity flavour than laphroaig 10 year old which i had the opportunity to try recently if you buy the bottle and are disappointed perhaps try leaving it uncorked for a half hour and giving it some time in the glass with a few swishes the core flavour won 39 t change but you may find it opens up for you a little more as a novice this is definitely a whisky to test yourself with and potentially open yourself up to the smoky side of things which i know now i heartily enjoy if you can get a sample it 39 d probably be a good idea  was looking forward to reviewing my first peated whiskey and i have to say i 39 m noticing almost no complexity at all it 39 s pure iodine all the way to the finish with a light smoke i 39 m beginning to wonder if recent batches aren 39 t what they used to be but as a new comer i wouldn 39 t know tried talisker 10 absolutely loved it death bought a bottle of this thinking it would be similar huge mistake basically what i would describe as the equivalent of liquid tar i can 39 t take jim murray seriously anymore not after rating this whisky of the year that bloke is a complete numbskull  best islay whiskey of them all i bought a bottle of laphroig and a bottle of ardbeg now i drink only ardbeg this tastes like a bandaid i 39 m pretty sure i can no longer have children  eccezionale sapore forte e delicato allo stesso lascia un 39 aroma salmastra e fumoso come solo un whisky delle islay pu 242 dare sentore di vaniglia e limone un big dram  sweet vanilla gives way to a lovely smoke and fruit flavor fused with sometimes strong cinnamon punch peat smoke flavor lingers for ever in aftertaste just wow extraordinarily complex and unmistakably a sweet fruity smoke islay gem scotch to behold indeed my favorite islay single malt 10 year expression  good quality for a price not first touched but when come back again and again found great experience good to keep one bottle at all time  love the taste literally like drinking a campfire perfect for a flask in a cold autumn day night this just feels so 39 british countryside 39 however we refer to this as headache juice as my brother and i both get splitting headaches after doing so much as a couple shots have tried to build up a tolerance to the poison but same result each time shame because it really is unique peaty smokey stuff and just tastes like you imagine scotch whisky should as a kid before you try drinking it if you have the tolerance by all means drink this in the fall in your chameau boots and barbour waxed coat  nose peat peat more peat a tinge of ocean air rubbing alcohol and more peatpalate fruits cinnamon and burning peatfinish hellfire peat smoke tar then more peat smoke boom bare flavour love this wish it was cheaper cause it 39 s all gone  it 39 s good i found notes of licorice to be a bit excessive for my taste but the smoke is carries it nicely through the finish it 39 s a lovely dram but i struggled to get past the licorice  first time i opened the bottle eeew what is this first aid kit tried a sip hmmm not bad but it s not my kind of whisky never had an islay before a month later i found myself at the duty free heaven on earth for me searchin and lookin for something interesting bump ardbeg 10 and then i realized i only had a half bottle at home so i bought it again why i bought it again dumbass long story short this is a fantastic dram i became an islay drinker because of this green bottle ardbeg is dead this whisky used to be my favorite malt even the normal 10 yo old used to be complex with smoke medicine and sweet notes after a quot whisky break quot of 4 years i bought myself a bottle of this stuff it is onedimensional and flat just smoke bitter notes and alcohol strength im really very very dissapointed every other islay i tasted recently is much better  first rate light in color witch i find unusual with an isley  a huge mouthful of moorland heather peat smoke wonderful if like me you love islay malts this is an epic dram but it is not delicate and if you 39 re not a fan of peat iodine smoke this won 39 t be enjoyable i have to confess i 39 d take a lagavulin in preference  bitter taste  i got a bottle from my wife and i love the intense taste made me drink it with ice the smell rests for a long time  massive peaty smokey flavour it reminds me of a log fire just starting to take hold i couldn 39 t really get much taste of anything else i would imagine it 39 ll be some people 39 s idea of heaven though just not mine recently bought this to try to like peaty whiskies as i 39 m a speyside man i must say i have changed my mind about peaty whisky i actually enjoyed this and being non chill filtered and obviously natural colour i actually had a nice experience i will be buying this again  probably my favourite entry level islay vibrant amp citrusy with a smoky slap around your chops for good measure somehow reminds me of my old mark 4 ford cortina i don 39 t now why maybe fellow cortina drivers so give this one a run out and see if the vinyl roof amp corduroy seat memoirs come flooding back nutshell if your love peated vibrant malts buy this don 39 t waste your time with lagavulin 16 a mere dusty vauxhall belmont by comparison though the lagavulin 12 cask strength 39 s a beauty but we 39 re talking jag xjs money  right behind lag 16 as my top 2 go to islay 39 s a pleasure to drink having recently cut my teeth on glenmorangie i can safely say this is a superior option the balance is impressive despite the myriad of flavors present ardbeg has found a way to infuse their whiskey with hundreds of years of scottish culture and not frighten a novice away good job ardbeg  this is by far not the worst whisky i 39 ve ever had but give me lapgroaig 10 over this anytime not sure i 39 d but this again just my opinion  i 39 m a big fan of islay single malts and have tried most of them but this one has been my go to dram for a couple of years now beautiful nose very drinkable and a looong finish i understand that this isn 39 t for everyone but you can 39 t deny the pure quality of this single malt very affordable as well 35 euro here in holland go get yourself a bottle if you haven 39 t done so already 92 100 a victim of its own success i 39 ve been drinking ardbeg on and off for the past 9 years but over the past two years or so it 39 s just not hitting the spot like it used to the nose isn 39 t as strong as it once was if you were to try it for the first time you would think it brilliant but demand for this malt is so high that l v m h can afford to let standards slip still passable but there are other finer and cheaper islay options out there  smooth without being anaemic delicate yet utterly substantial wonderful on its own but would enjoy a cigar with a dram or two  not as nice as the last bottle i had  so close to being 5 stars lovely smokey dram only reason it 39 s not 5 quite simply uigeadail  extremely well balanced whisky this 10 year old continues to be excellent it 39 s remarkable how well ardbeg has managed to keep the quality consistent the last few years the depth and complexity of such a relatively young whisky is extraordinary nose peat a lot of peat but afterwards ripe fruit apple pear vanilla and prunes raisins come to the forefront there 39 s a little cumin and sea saltiness there as well palate smoke like a tarry sweet smoke laced with again ripe apples the sweetness wavers while a hint of lemon comes to the front together with hints of the sea seashells seaweed oily on the palate and not the burning sensation many other 10 y o drams have finish gloriously long sweet sticky pruny smokiness it just keeps going a zip lasts for hours overall the best value for money you can get if i were forced to buy just one whisky for the rest of my life this would be it  exquisite not much words needed caol ila amp ardbeg  dangerous stuff addictive after opening you ask yourself what is this so many layers complex nice peat smoke sweet so you want more not for faint hearted when you empty glass leave on table all room get ardbeg aroma  i have been drinking scotches whiskeys and bourbons living close to kentucky for a number of years and then i came across this beauty i am a cigar lover so i know that my palate leans towards smoke and this is an outstanding pour for me in fact i find the back end of this whiskey to be very sweet once the smoke and spice settles i realize some people can 39 t stand the peat and sea but that means more for me simply a great pour not just for the price but for the experience  this is the best islay malt i have ever had in my opinion it 39 s perfect from the nose to the finish there are a lot of competing notes from smoky to sweet to medicinal that are in perfect balance not only is this my favorite islay malt it is also one of the best entry level malts i have ever had in addition to tasting so good ardbeg 10 might also be the best value in scotch whisky i usually find this for under 50 a bottle in the nyc long island area i love malts with strong and unique flavors whether from peat or sherry i couldn 39 t recommend this more great price great whisky i have had many a scotch and very much enjoy smokey malts however i finally got around to buying a bottle of ardbeg 10 and looked forward to tasting it i poured a small taster in a glass and could smell the nice peat smoke coming out of the bottle i also smelled a bit of medicinal scent which is fine all was good until i nosed it there was a rush of smoke nice but followed by a very sick smell that made me feel uneasy it was an unhealthy unclean scent it smelled like a good malt that had been poured over a rotten wound there was dead fish decomposing flesh and infected wound smells the taste was just as bad almost vomit inducing the phenol was very strong and tasted exactly like chloroseptic mouth wash i could not finish it what a waste of 50 it tasted like a rotting bum sitting in a fireplace drinking a bottle of mouthwash if dead flesh is an acquired taste i am not moving towards acquiring that taste i would rather drink sheep dip than this any day at least that is clean smokey and smells nice most reviews of this being so good are simply marketing at work lets not forget this quot little quot company ardbeg is owned by a giant clothing adverising company  makes this scottish decedent proud to taste such a unique orated whisky iodine and pepper and vanilla and smoke and peat how does that combine to be so wonderful on the palate the magic of the moors i guess  tons of peat this ardbeg is my quot heavily peated quot cheap option i have taliskers and several laphroaigs px qa etc but this is my everyday heavy duty choice  an unexpected windfall had me looking for a top drawer scotch with which to celebrate while talisker 10 an old and redoubtable favourite was tempting me once again i had long been reading about the ardbeg 39 oogy as an islay touchstone the ardbeg 10 was on offer i did the sensible thing and bought them both here 39 s me i love peat and smokiness when done properly laphroaig tastes like unrefined tcp for me i had one bottle of lagavulin 10 that was almost sherry like delicate rich exquistely balanced but another that tasted like cheap smokehouse not impressed this was my first go at ardbeg well well well the very same qualities albeit in a different context that kept talisker 10 an enduring occasional but affordable mainstay were tempting me away talisker is sea ardbeg is earth primal elemental the ardbeg 10 is an exquisite dram balance depth and complexity the extra alcohol giving it an almost eau de vie quality ardbeg 10 is what a great malt is about for me exceptional flavour and finish a transcendent and life affirming spirit i shall be sizing up their other expressions with great interest indeed 5 stars  i love it first up bang for the buck for 40 you get all the islay flavors in this wonderful bottle the sea salt the earthiness and of course the much talked about peat and smoky flavor the interesting thing is that this bottle has a cork instead of the regular caps which helps keep the smoke intact for a longer time when you remove the cork for the very first time you get that overwhelming peat smoke that we 39 ve all come to love the tongue of course is spicy and a subtle mix of sweet and citrus the finish is the best part for me the spice that liners on while the smoke warms your throat this is a beauty  great all around  such an amazing islay whisky the smoke is massive and the finish really really is long having been drinking whisky for about 5 years and starting with speysides i got a love of smokey whisky as i got more into trying the different regions this is not a whisky for a beginner as when i first opened the bottle last christmas i found it to complex with to much smoke but as the year has gone on i 39 ve grown to love it talisker used to be my go to for a smokey peated dram but ardbeg 10 knocks spots off it if you want big smoke then look no further  i have drunk more of this whisky than any other by far and expect to continue to do so i love all things ardbeg but this is the best priced and the best pound for pound too  drinking neat peat brine vanilla custard sweet floral root beer cream soda tobacco iodine sharpie sugar sweet spicy oily decadent fantastic ignore every non believer sampled ardbeg at my local whiskey bar w a friend except i didn 39 t catch the name of it fell in love with the intense leather smoke tobacco and iodine taste based on how light it was in color i assumed we had tried the 10 i purchased a bottle and now find i can 39 t enjoy it neat it is too bitter and over powering fuely if you will straight up however i really have come to enjoy it over i easier allows me to better savour the smoke and intricate flavors ardbeg has developed here give it a few minutes for it to properly mate with the water though  i think this represents for me the best value for money an excellent whisky that will never lose it 39 s appeal  i am fond of new flavours and open to experimenting this is my first try at single malt smoky oops quite strong flavour and taste repulsive surely will not repeat  i think it 39 s an acquired taste i loved the smoke but my first sip repelled me initially i started blending 50 50 with chivas and loved the result this blend has become my go to scotch i like it over ice the flavor unfolds nicely as i hold each sip in my mouth before swallowing i do think there is some validity to the people who mentioned the headache i 39 m a glutton for punishment but i have found that i often awake with a headache and i 39 m not one who usually gets headaches from drinking  horrible smell like tcp i will not buy it again like burned tyre  gentle mini sips letting the warmth and flavours encircle your mouth then a heavenly slow trickle down your throat the nectar of the gods  nasty smokey smokey burnt taste you can have this scotch and any other islay i have no idea on what the fuss is all about with this brand if scotch is an acquired taste i 39 ll never acquire a taste for this type of scotch  there 39 s something a bit wrong with this distillation i don 39 t know if they 39 re rushing it and creating a poor quality alcohol but just a few glasses of this and i feel it in the middle of the night and the next day some bad alcohols getting drawn off when they should be chucked  i want to love this but for me it 39 s marred by being a touch too dry on the finish and this accumulates so the more you drink the more you feel like you 39 ve sucked on a quinine tablet doesn 39 t go well with food for this reason for me the balance isn 39 t that good it 39 s too thin and a little bitter c 39 mon ardbeg you can do it better   maltmondaysthe nose intense sea salt amp thick dusty peat followed by green apples this scotch has a remarbkly strong herbaceous nature particularly oregano it s grassy with mild citrus undertones the taste immediate medium spice sweet amp sour textures lime thick salty sea air again theres a vanilla touch followed by the return of a vintage smoke as if the scotch were wood fired in a stone kiln prior to bottling the finish this seems to round off the scotch tie it in a knot pop the cork in while the lasting remnants fills your nose and mouth it s a big smoke but only a medium length in my opinion this is due to the lower percentage then other ardbeg bottling s  my first real foray into the world of single malts i must admit i was intimidated by my first straight sip added a splash of water and it seemed to transform from a into a wonderfully warm and inviting campfire a marshmallow on a stick peppered jerky and great friends i will definitely return to this wonderful masterfully crafted whiskey i am a scotch noob but i expected the color to be darker the flavor belies its light amber hue   but very nice too really amp suits a little smoke  band aid taste very nice tasting notes are spot on vanilla sweet lime smoke and peat a little meaty note with water one question does the flavor change and become a bit one dimensional as one progresses down the bottle i 39 m getting more dusty smoky and less of the lime sweetness also very interesting i ot a puff of smoke when i first opened the bottle is this normal anyway brilliant exceptional whisky overall not as good as the ugi though here 39 s a tip have an aberlour 10 or something like that don 39 t wash the glass but pour yourself an ardberg 10 with a splash of water aaaah  this is by far the best readily available single malt if you enjoy a peated malt the taste starts with a nice sweetness and quickly moves to tastes of smoke peat beach side savory meat licorice and mint the finish is very long and smoked with a touch of sweet and bitterness the finish is fairly similar to laphroaig 10 the taste is much more interesting and more comparable to lagavulin 16 and it 39 s bottled nonchill filtered and uncolored at 46 giving it a nice boost over the other two malts  not a seasoned whiskey drinker yet my current drink of choice is glenfidich 12 just opened the bottle ardbeg 10 for a little taste very distinguished love the cloudiness with a couple drops of water peatyness is amazing can 39 t wait to open my anticipated lagavulin 16 next  almost impossibly and superbly balanced in my opinion taking into account that the peat is indeed strong with this one but not overpowering and gives way to many subtle flavors it will take a bottle or two for me to truly appreciate this balanced complexity this is a great compromise between lagavulin 16 and laohroig 10 in my opinion just buy it if you like islay scotch you won 39 t be disappointed amazing for the money  maybe i got a bad batch but the ardbeg idlay single malt scotch whiskey ten years old tastes like wet car keys it is undrinkable i 39 m really disappointed because the price was substancially above a few other good scotch whiskeys that i enjoy but decided to try this sw in it 39 s impressive packaged box i will have to pour it out as it is foul in taste and smell i gave it a 1 star rating but i believe it to be below the lowest mark  i 39 ve not tried many whiskies i 39 m very new to them and as yet i can 39 t pick out the different flavours that explode on my tongue started with glenfiddich then my next stop was talisker 10 year old which i loved then tried glenmorangie 10 year old as it was the only single malt available in my local pub which i enjoyed but felt was lacking something in the flavour department the ardbeg 10 year old was on offer in my local supermarket so having so enjoyed the talisker i bought myself a bottle possibly the best 163 37 i have ever spent i 39 m torn between this and the talisker as to which is my favourite the only way i can think to settle it is to taste them both in the same night my palate is still learning but between ardbeg and talisker i will definitely be a very happy man  nose intense peat green apples smoke herbs taste finish spice sweet amp sour lime sea air mint good medium finish i 39 d recommend this to anyone who likes seated whisky good price nice design and heritage  a great smoky islay scotch rich and robust peat not sure what 39 s in it though as ardbeg gives me a splitting headache i thought that i obtained a bad batch and liked the flavor so much i bought another bottle down the road and the same thing happened same thing when i bought ardbeg uigeadail i 39 d recommend laphroiag 10 or lagavulin or caoila 12 over this based on my experience with it  i took the slow train to islayville but the trip was not without its merit i like all others before me started off with other single malts the glenfiddich glenlivet macallan etc my first big peat stop was the highland park 12 and it is still an excellent scotch but i needed more robust flavors spice pepper smoke etc so recently visited the old hickory whiskey bar in pensacola enjoying different drams and still wanted to venture to islay so the bar manager climbed the ladder to bring down the ardbeg ah finally the train came to a screeching halt and i alit to the most excellent scotch i had ever tasted for those of you who are not quite on the peat train yet no worries just keep riding eventually your train will come to a stop or if not just keep riding  the ardbeg 10 year old is worth a try if you 39 re into islay malts my first dram i thought it was overpoweringly peaty on the nose once i managed to fight my way through the peat subtle notes of vanilla and a very light citrus appeared more of the same on the pallet really but with an added touch of dried fruits not particularly sweet fruits at that which complimented the vanilla notes very well i came back to the bottle two or three weeks after the first dram and i noticed the overpowering peat had mellowed a bit allowing the vanilla to really flourish in the background much better the second time around however not bad at all the first time happy sipping friends  legs run very slowly and are fairly thick a medium aged whisky rich in oil plenty of character and complexnose is bonfire peat vanilla limey zest some liquorice palate is initially sweet then bonfire peat chilli finish is long and smokey then dry this is the best smokey peated malt the strong presence of guaiacol phenolic compounds giving smoke overpowers the o cresol phenols so if medicinal is only slightly so reminiscent of domestic peat fires in aroma  i can 39 t believe how many reviews of islay single malts i read online where people say quot i couldn 39 t stand the taste so i tipped it down the sink quot you tipped it down the sink seriously and all because what you didn 39 t like it guess what you paid money for that bottle of whisky you paid tax on that bottle of whisky and you go and tip it down the sink just because you didn 39 t like it let me ask you people did you even give it a chance to open up properly probably not did you ever think that maybe you 39 re palate just needed a bit more time to adjust to the islay style probably not you people really need to start refining your palates and properly enjoying whisky rather than just looking to get smashed all the time if you 39 re palate is too underdeveloped to enjoy the islay style than go back to your johnnie walker red label because that 39 s about as advanced as your palates are ever going to get  bought this whisky on my way back from thailand what a surprise when i poured my first glass how light the whisky was but what a surprise with my first glass the amazing taste of spice chocolate coffee and peat were unreal a superb whisky and one i will certainly buy again  a few years ago i reviewed this whisky and gave it a low score forgive me i was new to whisky and islays in particular the whisky has not changed but my palate surely has ardbeg provides a nice peaty kick in the face just what i need some times  ardbeg is the best  i am a fan of peat and smoke i have tried highland park 12 light smoke and ardbeg uigeadail heavy peat and smoke but sweet most go the other way around and start here but not me immediately the smell of adhesive bandages with a hint of lime and dark chocolate and of course smoke this eventually gives way to sweetness and vanilla this is much more complex than uigeadail and yet straightforward the taste is what you expect from the scent lime and dark chocolate and smoke and salty goodness i wish i was on a nice beach with sea spray finish is very long and the smell and taste of smoke with hints of espresso beans a solid 8 out of 10  recently got into single malts laphroig is my goto but this might take the cake lots of good stuff going on for such an affordable dram pace yourself  i was recommended bowmore 12 year to start my introduction to single malt i fell in love with the slight peat offered in that dram again referred to this 10 year and the complexity of the flavors the rich peat i fell in love again i 39 ve found a favorite and will be enjoying it being added to my collection consistently  this was my first venture into islay peaty whisky when i first pulled the cork it was a little concerning the initial smell was very medicinal and i worried i wouldn 39 t like it at all however once your nose gets acclimated to it a vanilla sweetness and a little citrus appears behind the huge peat smoke my first taste was similar to my first sniff very intense and i wasn 39 t able to really taste anything other than salt and smoke the second sip was much more pleasant citrus sweetness with a little salted caramel smoke and what i perceived as a quot meat quot like flavor the finish is initially intense and slowly fades with flavors of bacon salt and sweetness a very interesting dram my second dram contained none of the initially off putting aromas or flavors of the first perhaps because i knew what to expect until ardbeg i had only really liked the sweeter side of scotch and bourbon this is definitely a quot savory quot whisky and has quickly become one of my favorites  what the glendronach 15 is to sherry this is to peat a huge initially medicinal nose gives way to butter scotch and vanilla as you examine it more closely the palate starts with a brutal punch of peaty smoke but work your way through it and there is a wonderful malty caramel sweetness underlying the big peat as the flavors mesh into the finish you get bitter dark chocolate it 39 s a big powerful whisky that requires some commitment the first dram is positively unsettling but work it a bit more and you 39 ll find something really special and interesting in ardbeg  bought this for a second time recently and was honestly just as good as the first bottle i ever bought points to ardbeg for consistency epic amounts of rich earthy peat followed by a hint of saltwater and sweet peaty oak my favorite 10 year old laphroaig is close but this wins because its just more consistent and peatier the sugarbear the march 2015 bottling is vastly superior to bottlings over the past six years 2013 hit an all time low it was acrid kerosene like hogwash the 2014 wasn 39 t much better but the 2015 is right on the money a return to the rich deep peaty goodness of 2010 11 bottlings a bit young tasting with a slight mescal undertone which i did not like but this faded with time as the bottle level went down if ardbeg had mixed in 11 12 year along with the 10 it would have shine like a beacon to the good ole days of ardbegian dynamism before the frogs rained down like a plague on scotland and bought up all the distilleries globalism is not good at all for the quality of whisky coming out of scotland these days but i can overlook the froggy corps if oresent trends continue like the march 2015 bottling ardbeg is the best brand of scotch for me and this may be even better pound for pound than the oogie or corry sublime  my wife gifted me a bottle of this for our anniversary at first i thought i was drinking flavoured paint remover but i kept drinking it here and there and have since warmed up to it very nice indeed  great smell great taste this is a solid 4 whisky and has a great taste of the whisky from the distillation but somehow it lacks the flavours that would give it the complete taste had there been more taste given from the aging then i would have found an islay whisky matching and maybe besting laphroaig 10  ardbeg in a glass this ones got it  tastes like getting kicked in the balls feels but somehow i think i like it  very smooth with nice smokey after taste  at first i was taken a bit aback by the peat and phenols but i agree with others keep trying it and you will like it something different every time this would be great sipped out in the hills with friends  i love the peat there are nice soft fruit notes in the middle along with a smoked fish flavor into a mesquite ending up with salty caramel then smokey peat it just goes on forever wonderful after reading reviews we have purchased a bottle to try the initial aroma is intense and smoky but not in a good way almost as if i am smelling styrofoam dissolved in varnish remover the palate can only be descibed as i would imagine burned vicks vapor rub tastes is there anything lower than 1 star   start with a talisker 10 current batches are quite good as an intro to a bit of peat smoke then work your way into this little islay i 39 m in love with caol ila but the pricing on the 12 is ridiculous in the states this is as good takes water better if you 39 re inclined and is a quintessential intro to islay 39 s bigger malts in fact with lagavulin 16 and 12 pushing 100 and 130 respectively ardbeg 10 is the buy in islay malts everything islay promises is here seaweed oysters kippers citrus gorgeous phenols it 39 s all here if you can 39 t imagine yourself on the coast somewhere with a slight gale blowing mist in your face while relaxing around a fire with something delicious cooking in the pot ye 39 ve no imagination man a solid four and another 1 2 for the sheer value of this gem  10yo is best islay whisky for value it 39 s very complex yet it doesn 39 t flaunt the peat it gives way to the natural sweetness of the malt to produce a whisky of perfect balance  used to be scared of it but was cured by lagavulin and caol ila i still prefer a delicate speyside but i 39 m glad to have an ardbeg 10 in my collection peat takes water for me and the ardbeg 10 is mentally peaty but the more i taste it the more i enjoy it  so this was my first venture into islay i 39 ve been a talisker guy for a couple years but never had the guts to buy something else i 39 m so glad i did huge peaty smoky balanced and so smooth warms the whole body the finish is incredibly pleasant this is definitely one of those always in the cabinet whiskies  well worth it 39 s price smokebomb  i 39 m pretty new to islay malts but am rapidly growing my collection an interesting initial sweetness followed by salt smoke even a bit of beefy flavor i really am loving the islay malts if you like them this one is a winner as long as it 39 s around there 39 ll be a bottle in my whisky cabinet  my first island malt tried recently wow and i genuinely mean wow first impressions on smell and taste were hesitant to say the least but it was my second sip that really got me i had never grinned so much after sipping alcohol before salty smoky peaty tcp with just enough citrus to keep it fresh and alive i play golf and the next day which was wet and windy i could still taste this lovely warming malt it seemed to want to still offer its services also worth mentioning that if i have eaten rather salty foods drinking this can seem a little too salty i think i could develop an unhealthy addiction to this type of whisky as it is like nothing else you will taste in my ltd exp not for everyone perhaps but this whisky transports you it really does wonderful stuff  if you don t like peat tone s you shouldn t buy it but if you do it is everything they say a great buy bleach smells like the tar soap my gran used to use to wash us in tastes like nail varnish remover with a finish of dettol  too smokey and a little too peaty for me  nuff said  i had seen another review saying it was citrusy and smoky i wholeheartedly agree it is very present in the nose with a fruity smoke aroma kind of like operating a cider press next to a bonfire rather smooth at first then ending smoky a big change from my usual of bookers bourbon which is much sweeter and less smoky but a pleasant change non the less read about the awards this was also recommended to me by a friend but can 39 t get past the medicinal smell and taste money spent but not drinking this 2 stars because of the apparent appreciation for this in the single malt community  superb one of the smokiest whiskeys i 39 ve tried and i love it for that in my opinion smokier than lagavulin laphroaig and possibly even caol ila if you don 39 t like peaty whiskey this is most definitively not for you  excellent superb drink ever i had in my life  quite siply sic the best malt whisky that has ever kissed my lips a true treat in a tumbler  i am new to whiskys but i liked the reviews of this one so i went out and bought a bottle incredible stuff i don 39 t know what a peaty taste is but if this is a good example of it then i am hooked there is an overwhelming smell and taste of tcp for the first couple of glasses till your mouth goes numb i can see why some people would not enjoy that but i loved it  it s peaty taste is just amazing  the perfect way to finish a meal its peaty taste is just amazing  it 39 s worth a taste but just too camp fire tasting for my tastes the peat flavor is overtaken by the smoke if there even is any real peat flavor a splash of water seemed to help a bit but i never experienced the journey of flavor changes like i do with other scotch  this stuff is incredible i enjoy all of the peaty islays but i keep coming back to the ardbeg 10 year old sweet but not sherry viscous sweet its sweetness is delicate and even slightly floral and is mostly a vanilla creaminess keep in mind the sweetness i 39 m referring to isn 39 t ice cream or even bourbon sweetness sweetness in whisky is very relative and this is in my opinion a sweeter islay just more refined the whisky is so light gold in color its nearly clear of course there is that medicinal taste from the phenols and a smokiness that leaves all other islays in the dust but this smokiness is balanced and almost savory again this is relative here i see bad reviews saying 39 tastes like soap 39 or 39 tastes like bandaids 39 yes it has a medicinal taste as all islays do you wouldn 39 t write a negative review for a cheeseburger if you didn 39 t like beef i 39 ll drink nearly any scotch whisky but by far i prefer islays a distant second would be lowland malts as they are not sweet and are lighter and floral if your looking to test your palate and expand your horizons i urge you to try ardbeg once you do you will likely be an islay drinker for the rest of your days i tell my friends if you don 39 t like it try it again you will  a full flavoured drop with good complexity if you can find it i added 6 drops of water and let it sit for 5 minutes before i could say it was anything but smoky having said that if smoke is what you know you like then this is a decent drink for the price i will stick to my talisker 10 and when i can finally get my hands on some try the 18 and 57 north  as many times as i 39 ve given it a quot second quot chance i just can 39 t get past the overwhelming taste of absorbine jr or some other medical ointment i couldn 39 t help but believe i bought a bad bottle but other posts have assured me that i have not this is not for the glenlivet oban glenfiddich drinker  surprisingly rounded and full thankfully without the tcp of some islays the smoke is of course there from start to finish accetuated by water what i dont like is the tongue numbing effect of the peat so after a bit all i can get is smoke with any complexity lost up the chimney much better added to my home made blend 1 pt ardbeg 5pt cambus 24 5pt tobermory 20 where it adds a lovely smokey lift and also very good added to a mushroom cream sauce with steak this bottle is going to last a long time which is just as well because its overpriced  one of the worst whiskeys i 39 ve ever had it tastes and smells like hospital soap  tastes like it 39 s filtered through well worn tennis shoes over all awful give me glenfarclas 12 yr old any day  i find this to be a completely fine all the time islay whether for celebration or contemplation i wasn 39 t sure anything could make it better at what it is and it is well described by many here until i poured a touch into a glass with the sad last bit of my uigedail as it is said these days quot omg quot those 1 2 ml in 15 may have been better than either alone heretical i know my apologies but try it and see what unfolds what is amplified and especially how long and open is the sea blown finish  this is good whisky i like laphroig better this is like laphroig with manners sweet smokey and peated well balanced not my favorite but i can certainly drink it a few drops of water does improve it  sharp not well balanced some prickly attacks even though it has a lovely bonfire smoke compared to laphroaig 10 year old this one is far below  creamy smoky smoothit 39 s like tasting apple wood smoked cream with dollops of vanilla and sweet cherriesin shortoutstanding not a pleasant smell nor first taste subsequent sips were better a guest described the smell as 39 dry erase marker 39 to which i have to concede isn 39 t a bad comparison i 39 ll finish the bottle but won 39 t purchase again  lots of vanilla and creamy smoke like the guinness of the malt whiskey world unashamed of what it is i agree with some of the comments saying it 39 s not as smokey as other islays expresses its healthy dose of peat in a fat texture and a vanilla creaminess not the easiest drinking whisky nor the most approachable but when it 39 s right it 39 s so right try with oysters  had many very expensive single malts including islay ones somehow never tried the ardbeg 10 what a pleasant surprise big smoke peat palate fulfills nose perfectly smoke peat nicely integrated enveloped with sweetness beautifully balanced to compare vs the laphroaig 10 which i like as well i think the laphroaig 10 nose is smokier then its palate whereas in the ardbeg the palate perfectly fits the nose and thus feels smokier and more complex on the palate then the laphroaig yet somehow also more elegant and balanced then the laphroaig unbelievable value for money could be my new go to  bit hit of peat and smoke when i first opened the bottle i got a citrusy taste on the palate immediately followed by the huge smoky punch to your gut feel nice long smoky finish and a sensation of being by the sea that lingers long after you 39 ve finished the dram reminds me of a laphroaig 10 excellent i can 39 t quite decide which one i like better i can 39 t really give this anything other than top marks whilst it isn 39 t as smooth as lagavulin 16 it makes up for this by being so in your face peaty and smoky but with also a great breadth of flavour sea air bacon maple citrus fruits pepper huge doses of lucious peaty goodness there 39 s just so much going on here it 39 s not for the faint hearted or those uninitiated with islay single malts but for those who are it gets my highest recommendation stunning  reading the reviews i had to laugh at the person describing a quot chloroseptic quot like taste that others don 39 t seem to get well i have to inform you that we absolutely get it that phenol taste is part of the package that forms the basis of our love for everything islay ardbeg 10 and lagavulin 16 are two great examples of the taste of islay an unmistakable taste that will certainly either have you in it 39 s rapture or disgust the hell out of you as for me if it 39 s not islay it 39 s everything else because the islay taste stands alone  the review below from july 22nd 2015 quot the longer its open the better it gets 39 is spot on this is my second bottle of ardbeg 10 the first not really appealing to me much too smoky that was a year ago and since then i have purchased many a smoky peaty bottle such as laphroaig 10 i began to really appreciate the lap 10 but not the ardbeg seems many people swore by it though i am now giving it another shot as the other reviewer said you need to let this sit a bit it is so very stout that it begs for some air and settling or something smokiness aside it is very tasty just a dash of water will really let you enjoy it all that being said i still prefer laphroaig 10 it just seems to have more depth to go along with the campfire  my favorite peated scotch my favorite mid priced scotch it 39 s like sipping a small brush fire that dowses into a cool smokey mountainside on the finish it 39 s got a little salt to it i like it a wee bit better than laphroig  after having been introduced to islay malts by my father i started off with his favourite tipple laphroaig 10 i then tried talisker and lagavulin 16 and some of the other laphs yesterday i bought my first bottle of ardbeg 10 the smokey peatiness that i love is there and so is the saltiness and vanilla i love it but i can get exactly the kick from laphroaig 10 for 40 less money so its a great whisky but not great enough to warrant the extra price  got this bottle as a present and it is my first bottle of islay whisky i have tasted and liked very much lagavulin 16 and laphroaig 10 but i feel as the ardbeg 10 really has a whole new level of that intense and agressive peat and smoke aroma first it was quite overwhelming for a starting malt enthusiast but the taste really does grow on you can 39 t wait to have another dram of this  i got this initially to add some variation to my peat pallet as i only really drank lagavulin initially i found this quite harsh with relatively little nuance but after we drank about 25 of the bottle and left it 2 or 3 months it became much more dynamic subtle and interesting i dont know if the whiskey changed or i changed but its now one of my go to bottles highly recommended this one is a gem yes it is an angry young 10 year old given time on the shelf wont realy matter much it will remain pretty much as the day you opened it it is smokey warm and happy autumn fires and cold nights burn inside this one descriptions of band aids and plastic just shows how immature the reviewers are you kids really need to refine you pallet over how much it takes to get drunk single malt drinkers don 39 t drink to get bombed we drink to savoir the complexities of the drink isly peat scotch are for men only not children  its half the price but i find that it 39 s damn near as good nice and smoky a good starter for islay if you don 39 t want to go too cheap but want a true representation of the region 39 s flavor  i 39 ve liked several of the kilchoman bottlings but they typically run gt 60 in nc amp sc the machir bay 2013 14 was very enjoyable but 65 for essentially a well crafted 5 year old or thereabouts i wasn 39 t enamored of the ardbeg the first couple pours so utilized a trick i 39 ve had work with others pouring off 1 2 into another bottle and giving it a couple months to oxygenate and 39 blossom 39 i 39 m very pleased with it as a daily type dram when the spirit begins to suit your taste pour them back together it has greater depth than the kilchomans while delivering many of the things i liked about them an excellent value 50ish and a modern day classic if there 39 s a better islay for the price i 39 ve not tasted it  i find ardbeg to be like a sensory overload it 39 s good scotch but the peat and medicinal notes are a little much for me to pour a second glass you must certainly add some water at 46 or you will get a little too much alcohol burn to appreciate some of the sweeter and creamy flavors in the finish i 39 m thrilled that it 39 s natural color it 39 s a shame they have to put it in a green bottle or people would be scared away by the pale color and non chill filtered but it 39 s just not something i would put on my top shelf other than for it 39 s name i can completely see why people go crazy for it though it definitely stands out in the crowd  undoutably an isla from the moment you uncap the bottle wiht its strong peaty aroma amp iodine aftertaste very nice whiskey very peaty some citrus flavours there and a lot of phenol iodine taste also recommended to try and even have a bottle on the shelf when you want something different but still does not beat lagavulin 16 which is just smoother amp more balanced than this that doesnt make it a bad whiskey its just not the best while lagavulin 16 is around  this scotch reminds me of fall and it 39 s perfect for the winter months as well instantly i think of leaves burning in the fall however this scotch isn 39 t for the tame of heart i prefer a teaspoon of water or 1 ice cube  this along with laphroaig really are pound for pound the best scotches in the world  i bought a bottle of this recently after reading mountains of reviews i generally drink single malt or bourbon whiskey upon opening the bottle i was very displeased at first the cork broke right off at the cap upon opening and even trying to surgically remove it 39 s remnants i was still left with cork in the whiskey but the overwhelming smoke of this whiskey just piqued my curiosity and after straining a glass of whiskey and adding a small ice cube i gave it a try what hit me instantly was the nose the smell brought me back 10 years to the appalachian mountains of north carolina in the dead of winter with no heater other than a wood burning stove opening the stove to add more wood on the fire the smell of the charred remains of wood ash and smoke filled my nose the taste of the whiskey brought me back to hikes when i used to backpack in the mountains nights were my favorite as we would gather wood for a fire as even summer nights were cool there 39 s something about a fire that brings warmth comfort memories and awe the whiskey 39 s taste reminded me of a fire that has almost burned out as you woke up in the morning to try and stoke it up one good time to get it going for morning if you added a hint of vanilla to the fire finish was peat and smoke such a unique whiskey deserves a great rating this whiskey brought back so many good memories and took me back to a time lost i live in a hot humid region with no winter this whiskey is my winter as a note i generally stick to mccallan single malts but i enjoy a plethora of bourbons usually single cask  after cultivating the whisky culture at home for a while i decided to buy a new specific and smoky one i hoped the newcomers in my family will not enjoy it too much and i will have the pleasure for longer time my mistake i never had to buy new bottles so fequently and again as ardbeg 10  probably the most orgasmic smokey drops you can get close to caramel smoke and bite makes this dram among the 5 best i have in my collection of 200 and down to 100 years buy it drink it or die with a big gap to what the life was all about  i am the classic clich 233 started off with an aberfeldy 12 really nice and mellow then a dalwhinnie 15 slightly underwhelming then a highland park einar lovely then an arran 14 absolutely awesome i thought however it was time to step up as others have advised i bought a talisker 10 first dram i thought 39 this is weird and i am not sure 39 then by the second dram i was instantly hooked on the peaty medicinal taste and realised that all the previous whiskeys regardless of region were really slightly different versions of the same thing whereas this was something new i am now off to buy the ardbeg 10 and looking forward to that first dram then it will be a lagavullin 16 fuck this thing is good stuff  i 39 m a bit new to scotch in general and have primarily been drinking laphroaig 10 tried macallan 12 recently and disliked it so i started looking for something similar to laphroaig most websites recommended ardbeg so i went for it this is great stuff i find that it has less of a medicinal taste than laphroaig but an even stronger peat smokey flavor this is my new favorite single malt i definitely recommend it  i 39 ve tried from hp12 bowmore 12 laga 16 laph 18 kilchoman 3rd ed and the talisker 10 de amp 18 cos my tastes revolve around this type of whisky rather than the sweetish macallans glen mo livet 39 s etc this ardbeg 10yo is truly superb and is probably the best buy mind you about 3 years i had a go at a tasting and did not appreciate it probably cos i had about 12 15 drams down with quite a mix on my tongue and system i 39 d rate this at the same as the laph 18 which is twice the price in my parts  first time i try an islay malt and i think i 39 ve found my favourite drink it 39 s just perfect it is full quot rare quot flavours i really recommend everyone to taste it  wow a10 is a 10 it lives up to the hype all of the superlatives i read and heard are accurate i am a fan now and until somebody changes the recipe or process whom or who ever makes that poor decision should be shot i am so glad i procured two bottles should have bought two more wow this is perfect  so as of today ii have finally tried the big three the 3 scotches that we as scotch drinkers inevitably decide is our favorite scotch no offense to you sherry and or virgin oak aged air dried only drinkers which are great in their own right lagavulin laphroaig and ardbeg now i am relatively new to the realm of scotch but i can tell that there is a certain order you go in you start with blends like johnnie walker chivas regal dewar s etc but once you 39 e into single malts there 39 s no going back so you drink your glenmorangie and glenfiddich and try a sherry aged like balvenie double wood or macallan or dalmore and realize that you still want more richness and depth to your scotch so you try an islay for me it was lagavulin 16 year at first i wasn 39 t sure what to think very peppery and smoky with a salty seaweed taste that was strange at first but quickly became addictive and soon i needed more smoke so i bought laphroaig 10 year which for almost half of what lagavulin 16 costs was amazing very peppery and smoky with a huge hit of seaweed brine and finished with what can only be desrcibed as vanilla ice cream flavored band aids a superb whisky but nontheless i could not rest till i 39 d found the final of the big three islays so i went and bought ardbeg 10 today first thing i notice is smoke lots of smoke glorious amounts so smoky it will singe the hair off your balls followed with a hint of saltwater and more smoke with some vanilla and dark chocolate a couple sips had hints of pepper but not too much and i love that i feel that the pepper can take away from the beautiful peat smoke so i would have to say that this my favorite scotch now especially considering i just opened it today and it will only get better throughout the next few weeks laphroaig 10 will always have a special place in my cabinet especially for 40 but ardbeg 10 is a little better more smoke less medicine and pepper and for 60 with a nice glass not too bad unfortunately ive realized this a little too late because everywhere in my area is running out fast can 39 t wait to get uigeadail seems to be more available here in cali  taste is definitely subjective so i definitely don 39 t want to be snobbish towards those who do not love this whisky that being said when reading scotch reviews an overall picture develops of drinkers eventually catching the islay bug and getting drawn to the three pillars on the south coast ardbeg lagavulin and laphroaig there is no wrong answer i suppose but for me ardbeg is the clear winner there is just something extra amidst the smoke that makes it stand out it ruins almost any other whisky for me  i could not believe that this whisky had won awards since it tasted just like the horrible chloroseptic sore throat spray from my childhood upon research i 39 ve learned that quot with most lt ardbeg gt expressions using malt with a phenol content of 55ppm quot wikipedia and chloroseptic lists 1 4 phenol 14 000 ppm still it tastes the same apparently not everyone agrees  i love talisker 10 and lagavulin 16 but dislike laphoaig and caol ila 12 can some advise me on if i would like or dislike ardbeg 10 thanks  didn 39 t like this whiskey at all it doesn 39 t taste good more like disinfectant really looking forward to having a tot had it for christmas but it is undrinkable other people have tried and just not nice  i 39 ve been working my way through the various single malts i 39 ve had some speysides some highlands and almost all of the islays i 39 ve not had any of the other island malts jura talisker et al or any of the lowlands from my experiences i 39 ll probably stick with the big 3 from islay lagavulin laphroag and ardbeg i 39 m not a huge fan of bowmore i really like caol ila and i 39 ve yet to try a bruichladdich i 39 m not a sophisticated scotch drinker that can tell you every esoteric scent and taste so i won 39 t bore you with snobbery i will say that ardbeg 10 is becoming my go to quot daily quot dram sure i like lagavulin 16 a bit better for its complexity i might rate laphroaig 10 cask strength just a bit higher and i love the ardbeg uigeadail but dollar for dollar the ardbeg 10 is the best whisky on the market for my taste  ive had alot of scotch whiskys for the longest time i was a dedicated drinker to talisker however after buying this i refuse to drink anything else its smokey and smooth and has way to many more descriptive terms for me to list on here long story short buy it  i 39 m not surprised perse by the negative reviews but it is a bit disappointing one should know prior to making a purchase whether or not this would appease ones palate ok on to the review on the nose there was kefir lime smothered in salted caramel mired in smokey iodine as i continued to peel back the layers of peat smoke there arose sweet malty cereal notes and over toasted marshmallow with water the smoke waned slightly and the lime became more pronounced along with more ooey gooey marshmallow and dark brown sugar on the palate it is oily viscous and oh so creamy sweet sweet sweet charred oak and wonderful fresh band aids with chocolate covered espresso beans near the finish with water the espresso gave way to well done key lime pie witch hazel and sea sprayed caramel cremes the finish well it wasnt if you catch me it just didnt not for some time the bittersweet cacao espresso beans are back and the waves of sweet peat smoke mingle with seaweed smoke from a true new england beachfront calm bake including the brown bread with water it became a bit more creamy and a tad shorter but never ceased to amaze i still can 39 t get over the age of this whisky it is an old soul this one i love my talisker 10 but it is indicative of its age and a bit ill tempered this is a stunner and i can 39 t wait to see what else ardbeg has in store  i 39 ve heard ardbeg isn 39 t quite as good as it used to be as i 39 m new to this islay i wish i could of had it in it 39 s prime great smokey flavor iconic briney finish but the bitter dark chocolate notes unbalance it for me when water is added for the same price point i will choose the caol ila 12 over this everytime i can see why it has such strong following though it 39 s a great everyday dram  buyer beware if you 39 re looking for something a bit different look elsewhere this is a lot different i 39 m no expert but i do feel bold enough to suggest that anyone who describes this whiskey as anything less than powerfully smoky has something missing from their palate very interesting but not for the unadventurous  another great islay distiller ardbeg is known for their massive smokiness they put in their starter bottling the 10 yo and with good reason on the nostrils sweetish peat scents can be found but the expected smoke stays out right up until the moment you taste this copious amounts of natural smoke overflow your mouth it 39 s hard to trace other tastes amongst the rich and very pleasant smokeflavours on the finish the smokiness continues undisturbed and lasts very long this excellent scotch never offends or insults dispite the fact that it 39 s signature flavour is so massively present it 39 s a phenomenally balanced islay cracker rb  i was really disappointed with my first dram it struck me as too overpowering to enjoy can 39 t explain why but after going back to explore this bottle has become my clear favorite still enjoy my laphroig and my lagavulin but the ardbeg gives me something the others do not  initial aroma and taste like a punch on the face however after a few its not to bad reminds me of tcp  palate is too mild compared to uigeadail and laphroig 10 cs  love my whisky smokey lots of flavour and a good finish this ticks the boxes  i like it not an aficionado not by a long shot however i could not get beyond the first sip like nothing i 39 ve had before not in a position to say it 39 s good or bad and would never tell anyone to drink or not drink but please buy a miniature first i have one that i won 39 t be touching again i do like peat but this one 39 s off the scale  buy it you can 39 t go wrong  i 39 d buy it again it 39 s beautiful if you like peat you 39 ll love this taste is amazing and very satisfying i didn 39 t like laphroaig 10 so much but i love this it has a slight sweetness to it  this is the worst thing i 39 ve ever tasted i agree with the folks that say it tasted like a band aid although i would say a real dirty band aid i suspect that some people can perceive a certain chemical that other perhaps can 39 t similar to the sulfur issue with some whisky explaining why there are huge differences in the way people describe this whisky i would recommend getting the sample first if you can smell taste what i can there 39 s no way you would want to drink this  finally picked up a bottle of ardbeg 10 to go with my lagavulin laphroaig bowmore and john double black bottles and i 39 m really glad i did i don 39 t know that i would have been ready for this scotch a year or two ago this is not an introductory islay single malt if there is such a thing but even amongst the smokier peatier vintages this one is a standout do i like it better than lagavulin or laphroaig no because they are all quite distinct and i view them as complimentary not adversarial malts on its own this is an excellent islay and a monster of peat but if you 39 re going to pick up lagavulin and laphroaig you really owe it to yourself to pick up a bottle of a10 for the collection as this truly is an excellent bottle of scotch  i have been sampling different whiskeys to find the ones that suit and this one has made it into my top three with caol ila 10 yr and lagavulin 16 yr i love the peatiness but it doesn 39 t hit like a laphroaig truly a beautiful dram  corryvreckan is my favorite dram on the planet with uigeadail not far behind ardbeg 10 has similar smokey richness in the mouth but the aftertaste is really briny  if you are new to scotch then this would not be a good introduction the best thing about whisky is variety i personally prefer islay malts as they invoke the greatest sensory experience for the money ardbeg 10 is may hands down favorite the balance is perfect vanilla smokey peat and citrus blend sublimely into the sea smooth but be warned it is not for the faint of heart if you like this i strongly recommend uigeadale which is my favorite the sherry finish is fantastic cheers  its a nice dram yes but its all smoke for me imo there is a lot more to a good dram than peat and i dont get that complex taste i crave from this so im happy i had a glass at a pub and not a bottle for my cabinet as there are many other peated drams i would rather buy its not a bad whisky not at all but for me it is a over hyped bottle that lacks what i look for in a dram ill stick to my no age bunnahabhain or bruichladdich octomore they just have more flavour sorry ardbeg fans this is all yours cm i personally like peat though i have only tried the laphroaig 10 the laga 16 and this i find the laphroaig the peatiest but this is my favorite beautiful balance without losing the peat kick  very tasteful the best islay malt i 39 ve had so far the taste is really intense and smokey and similar to laphroaig but even better in my opinion this has instantly been added to my favorites which also includes talisker 10 dalwhinnie 15 glenmorangie original glenfiddich 12 and laphroaig 10  having been in love with laphroaig for a long time this is my drinking mistress peat vanilla citrus at the start then long peppery spicy aftertaste with the full smoke flavor this is definitely my xmas drink together with laphroaig 18 then again why to wait till xmas  i am a fan of all styles of scotch and have been lucky to enjoy even some very pricy ones on occasion but i think the ardbeg 10 is one of those really excellent bottles that doesn 39 t need the qualifier quot for the price quot it 39 s just plain fantastic in it 39 s own right and is distinct even from the other fine offerings from this distillery it does have a slightly youthful zest but it also has an amazing depth and complexity of flavor the smokiness is absolutely glorious yet somehow does not upstage the salted caramel and other highlights that many have commented on for what it 39 s worth my quot favorite favorites quot also include laphroaig 18 laphroaig 10 lagavulin 16 highland park 18 glenmorangie original aberlour a 39 bunadh mortlach 15 springbank 15 macallan 10 macallan 18 point being like me if you enjoy a broad variety of scotches i would highly encourage you to try or revisit ardbeg 10  this is the scotch i have been looking for just a taste trip from beginning to residual taste to all who don 39 t like this send it to me i will accept partial bottles and credit fly fishing trips in montana for full bottles ron oates montana outfitters 40 350 fih just because it isn 39 t your style doesn 39 t mean it deserves a low rating in my opinion it does 39 t get better for the price if you like this style of malt nose vanilla accompanied by lots of peat palate first taste peat followed by vanilla sweetness and some sightly bitter fruits like lime yum finish the peat lingers for a long time and after a few sips will warm you up lots of smoke as well in the finish overall this single malt will blow your socks off will warm you up on a cld fall winter evening highly recommended a  very peaty nose with hints of buttery cream smoke brine sea and medicinal again very peaty taste with hints of sea water smoke and medicine a long lasting finish with strong charcoal smoke brine and seaweed  islay malts seem to be somewhat polarizing i arrived at this malt in the wake of a wonderful experience with the ledaig which hits you with peat and sea salt with all of the subtlety of a car alarm going off at 3am so strange as it may seem i found the ardbeg a bit restrained in its salt and peat in comparison to some of my new favorites it s simply mouth watering though every dram features amazing complex ever shifting and evolving tastes satly and smoky but never unwelcome finished the bottle with a few friends about two months ago and i haven t been able to stop thinking about it since cheaper than lag 16 and perhaps just a bit better high praise indeed  a 1 no contest ardbeg 10 year old the best i don t really like this simple way to explain is that it tastes like smoke and leather to me i can drink it and see how people would like it but not my cup of tea i would take a jack daniels over this glenlivet 12 is cheaper and i like that much more but i know different style  when i jog through my neighborhood here in houston texas i often catch a whiff of smoke from someone grilling in their backyard and i m carried away to my quot happy place quot the finish of the a10 has the same sensory impact the soft smoke melds with the salty caramel and i find myself jogging down the quot low road quot unconsciously running faster and faster past the kildalton cross towards the distillery so i can transform the visceral into the actual a dram of a10 by the hearth and again the smoke soothes i m in a kef yes that s a real word look it up  novice single maltie here bought ardbeg to try my first islay scotch it was so smokey so medicinal tasting it rolled my socks down to my ankles don t think i can drink this and don t even know anyone i could give the bottle to yikes  i m new to single malts having only had old pulteney clynelisch dalwinnie and glenmorangie before i bought this ardbeg but the smokey biting peat taste really knocked me back adding a little water seemed to open the nose somewhat but this whisky will have to grow on me or maybe not  if you re not a fan of peaty malts then this clearly isn t for you if you are however then you are in for a treat this nip dances round the glasss and on the nose before packing a punch like muhammad ali it is so easy to drink but the smoke and sea air just hit you and stay with you sometimes right down to the bottom of the bottle  after having tried corry and oogie this one just left me thinking quot and quot especially since the aforementioned are bottled near 60 and this one a mere 46 the price is insignificant still if you ve tried and liked the others and want to get back to the roots of what makes ardbeg tick it s a good whisky and you won t regret buying it i just feel the others have more oomph to offer and i guess i like oomph  not a fan of this one far too peaty for me tastes like sucking on an amber from a camp fire  i couldn t put my finger on what i thought the aftertaste was and bandaid seems to nail it the smell is more of a chemical smell to me than smokey i thought that i opened a bad bottle but it seems that is how it is supposed to smell no way i can drink anymore of this need to rinse my mouth with some everclear  i m trying it this very moment for the first time i m reasonably new to whisky but this is a very nice dram to drink a sweet nose and a lovely smoky taste that lasts it does taste a little burnt plasticky but not in a bad way after reading the reviews i m going to have to try laphroaig for comparison  this is not a bad whisky but i personally see no reason to pick it over say a laphroaig which in my location is cheaper and offers a stronger and more coherent flavor the ardbeg 10 has a slight quot rubbery quot undertone which i don t like i can see how some people might interpret this as a facet of quot smokiness quot but i just interpret it as the flavor of bandaids unfortunately as for the good there are indeed the peaty spice and smoke oaky vanilla hints of citrus and some sea saltiness but i can get these same flavors with a bit more smoke and less rubber from laphroaig  not a scotch drinker let alone islay scotch became quot curious quot after my boys birthday dinner when all we were buying him shots of laphroaig got ardbeg 10 lagavulin 16 and laphroaig 10 cask strength here is my review of ardbeg 10 no escape glass so i used a big wine glass pour a bit and swirled and let breath for two minutes for me i take a breath and hold my breath and sip a drink and exhale it smelled peaty and a bit of iodine out of bottle after letting it breath it smelled like after taste of plain grits followed by smoky smell of rubbing alcohol the color a little light a and not as thick for me it tasted like light whiskey with smoky quot islay quot taste and a dry finish that hints a taste of iodine i like it but definitely a lighter and drier taste amongst the three to get an unbiased taste you have to go in with a biased approach of quot this is what islay scotch taste like quot if you like mellow light color scotch that a little dry you might like ardbeg 10 if you like crown royal that what it taste like a islay crown royal that is not as sweet as crown but a lot more peaty 8 out of 10  my experience is similar to the marmite post below the wife says why don t i just gargle with tcp as it s cheaper and healthier but i adore the smoke and peaty aroma of islay whisky with ardbeg 10yo and oogy the kings in my opinion lovely lovely whisky a bit more firey than lagavulin and laphroaig in my humble opinion but full of peat salt and all that is good  this scotch gave me a hangover it is not pure moreover the taste is off yes it is smoky and full of peat but it ends empty and hollow nonetheless my major concern is my hangover this dram is tainted yo  i love the ardbeg range not only my favourite whisky range but range of all alcohol products this ten year old packs a deep smokey nose much like picking up the aromas of a campfire burning on the lot beside you the body on the palette is medium to full bodied which you could tell from the beautiful legs running down the side of your favourite whisky glass the finish is a long lingering peppery and oaky flavour that leaves you wanting more and you wouldn t have guessed any of this by the deceiving but beautiful natural light golden colour of fantastic single malt i love the ardbeg ten as it offers an experience that goes nearly unmatched unless you are drinking ardbeg specialty ranges like uigaedail alligator or ardbog 9 out of 10 a couple other great whiskies that offer similar experiences are laphroiag quarter cask and caol ila 12 year old  my usual drink is glenmorangie wanted to try this quot peat and smoke quot thing not for me smelled like a watered down house fire wrung out of a cotton towel into a bottle not my idea of fun  we went to islay earlier in the year and it rained for the entire week i would imagine their whisky is the same  peat and smoke bomb chargrilled nuts and bonfire long long finish classy dram  i love peaty drams and after many years i finally tried the supposed legend or ardbeg where to start the nose doesn t carry that pure peatiness of a lagavulin or laphroaig theres a sour odour of burnt rubber very dry on the palate with a slight bitter note definitely no sweetness here still carrying that rubbery bitterness through the finish is very dry something i quite like but i find the whole experience very confused the big smoke just isn t there for me its smokey but not a patch on a laphroaig and its just nowhere near a lagavulin 16 the peat in that has real momentum and carries right through to the finish here its all very confused disappointing nasty just give me ardbeg  i agree with some of the comments about tasting antiseptic but a few drops of spring water can do wonders for a palate the finish i like not sure i would buy another bottle though  sorry folks ardbeg is simply a nasty tasting scotch for me my wife and 2 of my neighbors none of us liked it that peculiar taste of band aids was overpowering and unpleasant i ve blown through about 1 2 the bottle and i can t get used to that taste never mind enjoy it furthermore none of us could detect that quot smokey quot taste everyone crows about give me laphroig glen garioch jura dalmore or glenfiddich 15 anytime just don t give me ardbeg  my favorite whiskey of them all i m all about smoky whisky and this is the best yet laphroaig is too tame  this is an extreme the aroma keeps my girlfriend at arms length but the taste is wonderful not for everyone but it is probably the smokiest whisky on the market leagues better than laphriog  this is like an epic awesome whiskey i must have like been looking like forever before i found this one it s like totally epic i have tried like awesome numbers before i found this what i totally don t like understand is why the place is like called islay and not island like the others still like this is an epic totally awesome drink john boston ma  bought because of high taste rating posted on sign tastes and smells exactly like the old lysol antibacterial cleanser that has been discontinued for some years recalls memories of cleaning bathrooms not that there s anything wrong with that  i m glad i went for the tester first as this isn t for me heavy smoke medicinal finish that lasts i wouldn t buy it but that s just my taste recommend a tester for this one  is islay was a cake this would be the slice with all the frosting stellar dram balanced with the right amount of peat the best i can equate it to is eating peanut brittle at the beach on islay next to a campfire at night oh and it s foggy definitely foggy but this malt right now do eet  love it but cheaper to buy here so strong on the aroma yet so smooth on the tongue i pay just under 100can here in ontario and it is worth every penny i have tried some others in this price range but sofar nothing else is even close and i feel no need to spend more some may be turned off by that strong smokey aroma but if you are hold your nose and simply taste it i doubt you will be sorry you forced it past your lips enjoy  can never figure out how this islay can be so powerful yet so smooth and balanced but i suppose that s the unique magic it s just perfect and easily the best value of any single malt i ve yet to try  i give this a ten simply because of the strong and long lasting balanced bomb of peat smoked glory that will send your tastebuds into whisky heaven while your mind will send you thinking of huge bonfires at a beach in the middle of the night islay never stop to surprise me and if it s not my favourite whisky yet it bloody well might be before the bottle is empty long traditions and a knowledge of what defines the whisky s from islay is what you get in this bottle you will feel the spirits and by god they will stay in your mouth for a long time when you drink this it s absolutely astonishing if you prefer to drink ladies drinks stay away from islay whisky s this is not for you these precious drops of nirvana should not be spilled on infidels enjoy your drink with a dash of tempered water as this baby holds 46 and you might want it down to 37 before it will kiss your mouth softly if your cold from a long walk outside sit down in a good chair sit back and say hello because you deserve it  never been a fan of peat actually hated it but when i was in a pub and this was the only whisky available i thought i d give it a go i was blown away by the quality of this whisky so much more than just peat going on it s rich with vanilla and cream the peat it s self is smooth and just lovely all the people saying it tastes horrible i urge you to give it a second chance the day i tried ardbeg is a day i will always remember can t put a price on new experiences with good friends in a pub  i was sure someone would offer to kick my arse for spelling whisky as quot whiskey quot sorry about that cant get enough of that smokey flavour though love a good peated scotch  i be only recently started drinking scotch but i ve tried many types most distinctly lagavulin 16 year in my opinion this is my favorite so far it s sweet yet smoky at the same time and doesnt leave a bad after taste like the glenlivet  after my first bottle of ardbeg 10 it instantly became my favorite whiskey i love the long lasting peaty taste on my tongue i am no expert on single malts but i know what i like and now want to try morefrom ardbeg simply superb my first islay and wow citrusy seawater and liquid smoke initially intimidating yet intriguing the first dram is different and a little scary then you want more like sex  interesting whisky it is the smokiest i have tried but the smoke is almost like camouflage because once you get past it this is a very mellow somewhat sweet whisky with a dominant vanilla taste and a soft sweetness the whisky has almost no color so aesthetically not the most appealing lagavulin 16 my favorite is almost as smoky but has a more intense color and the taste is more complex only way i can describe it still it is a very nice whisky someone commented about drinking hoppy beers and having a conditioned palate for strong flavors i understand i too like very hoppy beers and the islay whiskies seem to satisfy my craving for strong flavors the most balvenie is good too but almost as a dessert whisky  this blows any other 50 bottle away lots of smoke and peat but smooth laphroaig is not even in the same class much more harsh i tell people all the time nay jw is not for real scotch drinkers it for people who think they drink scotch arbeg is for scotch drinkers tried the more expensive ones above the 10 and did not like them as well quote from my friend who loves cigars and scotch ardbeg is his scotch and cigar in one when he cannot light up inside  one of the best bangs for you buck when it comes to islay scotches ranks up there with the more expensive lagavulin overly powerful antiseptic finish only for those who really like the peat classy but narrow in appeal i would think  okay if you re not a fan of islays you re simply not going to like this but this is to my palate a class above the pack  if you wanna know the difference between a blended and a single malt start here this is a stand alone revelatory scotch that should make you realise why you shouldn t drink blendeds it s an affordable favourite and is very distinctive nearly unique  colour is just awful makes you not want do drink thatquite smooth unbalanced taste all i can get is the smoke in your mouth to all amateurs like myself do not fear the bad reviews for the supposed overpowering nature of this beautiful dram it is actually more polite than i imagined it would be definitely strong and unique in peat and smoke but not an all out assault on your taste buds the way a very hoppy ipa beer might taste maybe my tongue has toned down the extremes from drinking strong beer but this stuff tasted like leather menthol sea salt heaven with a little citrus in there for good measure the nose is stronger than the flavor i think so don t let it put you off give it a sip and enjoy  quite a bit of the iodine smell can be offputting at first but when having this dram occasionally it is tolerable the peat hits you and you imagine yourself eating a forest fire the smoke the bbq meat the fire pretty good stuff can drink this neat but not my everyday dram  and that was a failure as i somehow clicked a half star on the my added info can a moderator or site owner delete the quot adding quot review or remove the half star  i m not adding a star review intentionally because i m simply too new and haven t tasted enough to really form an opinion i feel i lack experience to adequately grade this officially but i wanted to chime in just the same  i m new to whisky having finally discovered my desired taste profile when a neighbor served me a glass of lagavulin 16 since then i ve been on a tasting journey trying to discover as much as i can when the opportunities arise mostly i m finding that i just prefer smokey islays and thus my first purchase was a bowmore 12 which i enjoyed but found it lacked the smokey peaty punch of the lagavulin it was a good introduction to the region nevertheless my second purchase is the ardbeg 10 and i m not all that far into it but i m really enjoying this i ve had the chance to contrast it directly to the lagavulin 16 and though both are sublime i do think this ardbeg 10 is my winner price isn t the concern as they re both pretty pricey in my area 92 for ardbeg 109 for lagavulin montr 233 al i d like to and will eventually own both simulataneously but at current time i m giving the nod to ardbeg so this review is from a total novice but i m willing to and wanting to do this right i d like to try a few more islays and then explore some other regions and styles i like to be thorough so i feel i can t move on from islay until i ve had at least laphroaig and bunnahabain   sweet bonfire smoke a superb dram but really it is not for the vast majority of whisky drinkers it is best appreciated by someone who knows their whiskies and has some degree of skill with tasting and the words to express themselves it is clear to see from the grammar and comments of some of the reviewers that they really should stick to lager and bitter please leave the serious comments to educated whisky drinkers such as myself and a select few  love this great straight but add just a teaspoon of water and wait for the magic to happen beautiful sweetness on the tip of the tongue reminiscent of sweat bonfire smoke on a dark winter day infused with vanilla as it travels over the tongue more arrival of flavour the smoke peat sweet saltiness that the sides of the tongue pick up the finish is long flavours of bitter dark chocolate or espresso coffee on the nose smoke peat iodine and a faint sweetness of burnt wood with every sip i m transported to a wonderful mysterious magical place  my husband wanted to try this after seeing a lot of good reviews it s terrible he even made me try it to confirm it way too much smokey peat and oak nasty waste of 52 very disappointing i am a big fan of the smoky jura and hoped for an equivalent balance i find it to be too thin in the front and too much stale smoke in the back it is more like a thin reedy cigarette than a lovely mellow peat fire it certainly is strong but strong doesn t necessarily mean good i will actually be pouring this out which is always a tragedy  ardbeg continues to be in my opinion the finest distillery on the planet a true success story after battling back from the brink i tend to wander away from ardbeg 10 at times but i am always drawn back the initial huge peat rush both on the nose and palate is quickly joined by vanilla a fruity sensation and a beautiful sweetness perfectly balanced and worth every penny and then some  been experiencing the joy of whisky for 32 years amp had the good the bad amp the ugly but this one i just don t get at all personal taste amp favorite for me is heavy on the smoke amp peat with a nice smoothness this however doesn t tick any box for me i found this out having purchased a whole bottle so i would advise anyone due to its price tag to try a sample bottle of the stuff first  don t really see what all the fuss is about to be honest it is good but i d rather have a bottle of caol ila 12 any day  brilliant whisky well balanced and interesting the finish is smooth and to die for  unbalanced overwelming and boring i prefer so much the lagavulin 16  simply the best islay whiskey on the planet pound for pound i tried them all there s no denying the truth  if its peat smoke you want this has it to me it was a 20 bottle but i guess i am just not a fan of this type had it while trying others balvenie dalmore j black gold and this this was not for me all whiskys have their own character and this is why i love the drink i am very open minded i actually tried a whole bottle of ardbeg 10 and it was far too peaty and smokey for me to the point of overpowering the drink the colour is very very light for a whisky not for me but don t let me put you off trying this whisky it was jim murrays 2008 best whisky so it must be very good would i buy another bottle no evidently huge amounts of peat flavor are added and then some of the less pleasant components are removed by distillation and aging so it doesn t taste like the smoke in smoked fish or meat it s almost unrecognizable as peat smoke at all but for such a mouthful of eucalyptus citrus resin i don t know what but i do like it very much it s the only islay whisky i routinely keep in the cabinet partly too because lagavulin amp laphroig tends to be priced higher than i m willing to spend they re great too in their own ways but if you don t like smoke per se don t shrink from trying this one it s amazingly full of flavor yet smooth you ll hate it or love it  a safe buy you get what you pay for and thats a bottle of fantastic islay whisky very nice indeed as good as the laphroaig 10 yrs mike stockholm sweden i had an occasion to sample the quot 10 quot i am hooked now if it were only available here in ukraine i would be more than thrilled i would throw away the damn vodka still and just drink this  this is one of the smokiest things i have ever tried the peat hits your nose as soon as you venture close and a wealth of complex oak and vanilla follow right after it goes down smooth neat and is definitely a whisky that is to be savoured delicious  ardbeg s taste is unique a solid scotch and a personal favourite  i love different things about all three of the south islay quot peat monsters quot the complexity and almost infinite finish of lagavulin the medicinal quot peat reek quot of laphroaig and with ardbeg it s the smokiness and taste on the palate that endears it to me it s so powerful it has to be the last dram of the night you can t taste anything else after it this is a beautiful whisky although for the money i d argue that laphroaig 10 cask strength is a better buy but that s just my opinion and malts are a personal thing can t recommend this stuff highly enough  1star is too much this has to be one of the worst tasting whisky s ever vile and all i could think of was jeyes cleaning fluid don t waste your money disappointing the 2nd best on the market if you ask me here we have the ardbeg 10 a winner i could not recommend this one enough mike sthlm sweden i love ardbeg 10yr after a few one night we discovered our own best way to describe it nose wafts of old fisherman s wax jacket with hints of burnt peg leg palate rich smokey brine and vanilla dipped in iodine finish lingering peat smoke and developing urge to catch a fish it truly is one of the most complex malts going  a beautiful smokey peat blast from islay taste like lemony barbecue beef keep up the good work ardbeg  i love this scotch i feel like a woodsmen drinking this great scotch from the islay keep it up ardbeg  it is refreshing change to see a wide range of views on this topic but i do feel that there is a degree of inverted snobbery in whisky drinking having steeled myself to try it i was pleasantly surprised at the taste considering what an abysmal odour it presents when the bottle is opened however that does not make it something i would rave about fortunately there are many more still to try  i expected a peaty monster which as it first hits the mouth it delivers peat and coal by the shovel full but only for the briefest moment the sweet malty flavour then comes to the fore finishing slowly with smoke and sweet malt barley intertwined deliciously for me a little water makes the peat more complex but at the cost of the sweet malt so neat every time absolutely excellent i can honestly say i have never enjoyed a whisky more  there was such a hype on ardbeg 10 as the real true character of islay whiskies i bought a bottle and could ve added a few bucks more for a proper islay whisky like lagavullin very disappointed too much medicinal phenol  i like ardbeg 10 but it seems to be missing some body and finish but still good a good malt to try if you re a fan of peat  having lived away from the uk for a while people would often ask for a nip of my whisky if i ordered something exotic in my local well stocked bar much like the shopping lists that you see on the side of barried up motors people like to list their favourites with a show of pride germans were no different when it came to ticking boxes but ardbeg was always guaranteed to be the one that they swerved when given a free nose above my glass now that i find myself in norway i m pleased that the local vinmonopolet stocks this as one of their basisutvalg perfect for friday nights in a cabin after a long day s skiing  pungent burn sharp finish confusing didn t enjoy it i ll choke it down with its 55 price tag in paris will not buy again lagavulin 16 still at the top of my list will try the uigeadail i haven t given up on ardbeg altogether  lagavulin 16 laphroaig 10 talisker 10 bruichladdich the laddie 10 and perhaps next to lagavulin 16 the best an open fire a well worn chesterfield chair a plate of home made smoked salmon and a glass of ardbeg 10 pig in s t eddie in bolton  talisker lagavulin laphroig bruichladich tried them all ardbeg 10 every time  2 glasses not pub measures neither  so so smooth the taste notes hit at an electrifying pace yet one can determine each and every one the toasted marshmallow is simply divine only drink if you can fully appreciate what can only be described as one of the best malts ever ballsy yet subtle simply put yum  my favourite malt since i can remember oh and a wee word to the haters ardbeg is serious stuff and was never meant for the feint hearted do yourself a favour however and come back in a few years when your palette is mature if you don t taste one of the finest malt whiskies on the planet i d venture this whisky lark just isn t for you  this guy would nt know a bottle of whisky if he got hit on the head with one just stick to the sugar and water mate oh got carried away there this stuff is just great but would also recommend the ardbeg uigeadail whish is just bliss  after all the reviews i really thought i would like this one but what a disappointment i always take my dram with irn bru which i find adds more flavour to a whisky however i have to say that this did not mix well in fact it tasted quite awful i ll give this a miss in future and concentrate on the better quality maltsronald mitchell the three islay distilleries in a row down south all seem an acquired taste when compared to the massive remainder of single malt scotch whiskies the best balance is in the ardbeg 10 and i m a fan of the laphroiag cask strength offerings as well good to know what you re getting into before you try  wow very different not expected the iodine taste was overwhelming from start to finish big smoke with iodine huge disappointment no second chances here jw red take me back loved this product from the first glass and after comparisons with other favorites ardbeg uigeadail lagavulin 16 laphroiag 10 and quarter cask it still holds that position some of the negative reviews here help to point out that this whisky is not for all is really more indicative of ones general preferences lots of people love this exemplary islay drink and for very good reason heavenly to savor the smell taste and lingering fragrances top of my list   quot ardbeg 10 quot was my first delve into the ardbeg range and i was not dissapointed i had previously only found one other peaty malt and stuck to it my being a creature of habit i stick to what i like and don t change but this ardbeg 10 was a gift from another malt man the first crack of the cork released a huge peaty blast from within it was like releasing a peat genie from a bottle the scent was instant i passed some into a glass and left to air for a few seconds on the nose this revealed a fire that had just gone out leaving that wonderful smokey burnt wood scent first sip and held in the mouth an instant hit of peat and burnt wood accompanied by a moist earthy aroma on the back of the throat again a truly pleasant taste i am a pipe smoker and favour the traditional tobaccos of days long ago like digger flake still available today as i sit with lit pipe and a glass of ardbeg 10 the two compliment each other like they were meant to be together i am not usually a fan of adding water to my malts but was curious to see what could be coaxed from this islay malt how much range has this whisky got an small dash of water added swirled and mixed and then tasted the peaty fire had died down on the pallate and i was this time greeted with a much more subtle flavour still retaining the earthiness and wood aromas still displaying the peat aroma i did find a warm citrus after taste at the back of the throat it was lighter and had a quot happier quot more relaxed taste with bitter dark chocolate tones upon finishing the first glass if you breathed in through the nose with mouth closed closed your eyes you could still detect the outdoor smells a peat fire damp earth after a light rain fresh leather like new shoes and a hint of sea salt air as if actually standing beside the sea this malt kept on giving pleasure long after the glass was dry i recommend this malt to anyone who likes a peaty flavour to their whisky it s not as strong as other peat loaded malts on the market but to me ardbeg 10 has got the balance right on everything enjoy it with no distractions no tv no computer turn the lights out and have a few lit tea light candles glowing on the mantle piece add a cd of your favourite easy listening songs and pour your first glass close your eyes and wait as your tongue transports you to the western isles in scotland where you will stand on the white sand beach breath in the sea salt filled air smell the fresh cut peat and feel the warmth of the fire that has been lit to welcome you no passport is required just a good taste in malt whisky and with ardbeg 10 you can travel far without leaving the comfort of your favourite chair rating i give this whisky the full 10 points available david gerrard banff aberdeenshire  really lacks the peaty smoke of its islay brothers very disappointing in that respect however it is nonetheless a highly drinkable easy going dram i wouldn t buy again instead favouring laphroig or lagavulin  not a connoisseur of single malt whisky s but i know what i like i really enjoyed this birthday gift from my daughter in australia i have read all the previous reviews and my amateurish remarks gleaned from those are loved the sweet vanilla taste on first taste then the smoky peaty flavour hit me which was really to my palate and the after taste which lasted lovingly was much to be admired i hung on for as long as i could before my second sip just to make the tot last longer where the iodine remarks come from i can t fathom this beauty is far from medicinal and i for one will be very sad when this bottle is finished i won t be sharing it with anyone believe me and although i don t usually pay out this sort of price on a single malt i would certainly be tempted to treat myself truly beautiful thank you joanne my daughter and ardbeg  i love peaty whiskey and this comes a very close second to my fave laphroaig superb i wanted to see what all the fuss was about so i got a sample of this my taste notes below nose medicinal smells like anti sceptic cream iodine palate smoky peat salty and iodine flavours prevail sweet vanilla and citrus tang finish smoky peat and caramel and salt spray smoke flavour lasts a long time after the rest after about half a shot with water left with a mouth that feels and tastes like an ashtray  what a horrible taste and awful after taste most disgusting whiskey i have ever tasted poured it down the sink  this has to be the best islay whiskey of all and there are some good ones just the tool for a cold winter s night  great quality malt for the price much more on offer than other islays in this price range lovely sweet vanilla cutting through the smoke with grilled orange i am primarily a speyside highlands scotch drinker but i thought i would give this one a try to see the difference i tried it pure at first with no dillution and could hardly stand the medicinal taste since it lingered for such a long time it tatsted like i was sucking on a bandaid or a roll of gauze i tried it again today with some water and the tastes were different and i welcomed the change nice for something different but i think overall i ll still end up sticking with my macallan glenfarclas and glendronach  don t be fooled this little beauty has a lot going for it despite its tender 10 yr age lots of complex vanilla a lovely sweet smoke and grilled oranges make this one of my favourites who can argue for 35 for a whisky of such quality an absolute bargain  if we were to compare islay whiskies i d put this above its laphroaig counterpart but the lagavulin 16 is a cut above in an ideal world the ardbeg would be 5 10 pounds cheaper but it s still worth the money  the slightly hint of iodine is very overwhelming and leaves a horrible aftertaste just think about what iodine smells like and it tastes just as it smells  ... i have only recently started to drink and enjoy peaty whiskies and ardbeg knocks all the others i have tried into a cocked hat by adding a teaspoon of water releases a wonderfully fragrant mix of vanilla lemons sea air oak open fires and our good friend peat compared to other peated whiskies ardbeg 10 has a wonderfully warming slow surge of smokiness beautiful  the uigeadail is for me the king of the ardbeg castle but for less than forty quid there is no better whisky than the house ten year old no whisky drinker s collection should be without this whisky  i like my islay s and this might just become my go to bottle i enjoy it more than the laphroaig i m not sure i prefer it over bowmore s darkest but it s price and local availability will have me reaching for it first  am a fan of islay drams just got a bottle of this and i am a believer it holds an amazing balance between lagavulin and a bowmore or coal ila where smoke sweetness and iodine saltiness are in balance it seems to do what the other try to really impressed  typically i m not an islay drinker and have very particular tastes when it comes to this region i m more of a speyside or highlands drinker however for me ardbeg makes a fine scotch very mild peat taste flavorful smoke with a surprisingly nice medicinal flavor just before a smooth sweet finish definitely not bad  big smoke a lovely creamy sweetness and some lovely coffee like bitterness on the end a lovely entry level ardbeg malt that isn t really a entry level malt at all  oh so nice i had to have another lovely not to peaty and the smokeyness stayed with me for ages after i had whished it round my mouth  i truly enjoy this scotch peat taste smokey and smooth taste and is great with many cigars fantastic islay single malt smokey nose smooth peaty notes malty sweetness and a finish that is hard to find elsewhere the balance is perfect and the complexity from the extra abv is wonderful i highly recommend it  thgere is no going back on this one pound for pound it is simply the best   for simply the best if you d like it slightly less sweet with a bit more balance and less iodine but just slightly less this is the dram for you not a fan of the islay single malts but if you like them peaty with a hint of smoke this one is for you  this is my first bottle from ardbeg i loved it and look forward to my next bottle a bit medicinal at times but overall a good choice  ardbeg is not for everyone this is the man s single malt  nothing more to add than sit back relax and enjoy don t get me wrong a fine whisky indeed i think when comparing to islay s laphroaig ten is the better value again a fine tasting whisky i have a hard time justifying the extra money when comparing to the laphroaig  yes it may be only 10 yo but make no mistake ths is a giant of a whisky it is of course bottlings from the distillations of the previous owners but under the new regime it is good to see no compromise on chill filtering interesting to compare this to the new renaissance expression  the finish is absolutely amazing leaving a subtle cauchuck like film of a dark chocoalate taste i normally prefer sweet sherried malts but i made an well justified exemption for that tipple 
1767.0, never mind the hints of oil fennel figs and various other fruits when at the bar and i 39 m buying i buy dewar 39 s on the rocks but when i drink alone or with special friends at home i drink balvenie double wood its best served on the rocks with a slash of water to bring out the malted peak of the scottish bogs it takes one of scottish ancestry back it time time from whence one came the end  it is a dram to go home to when you have things to work out if you like me have many to choose from use this one first then you may not go further if you do then its a good yardstick its just so easy to enjoy and what you sat down to work out will be done  excellent my favourite tipple a friend bought me a shot of this wonderful this is something to be sipped and enjoyed  the whisky against which i judge all others i prefer my whisky on the sweeter side and this really delivers without being overly sherried outstanding value for money very nice smooth just perfect as ever  this needs a few drops of cold water as it burns but once you start sipping you really appreciate it a pleasant after taste and goes well with some fruit  perfectly balanced deep flavours and incredibly smooth this is the rolls royce of 12 year olds malts  full bodied sweet spicy delicious and deserving of 5 out of 5 stars favourite dram first time i ve tried this and i m really pleased notes are mild so very smooth on the palate i got liquorice and finishes as good as any other premium 12 will buy again altime favourite dram complex and full on flavour  personally i think balvenie double wood is one of the smoothest malts you can drink a very evocative treat packed with surprises pleasant and exciting perhaps not suited to a beginners palette incredible flavours on first tasting way more depth than the nose suggests hints of fig oil candied red fruits quite spicy with a faint whisper of fennel a long sweet finish rather enjoyable before or after dinner  love this delicious whisky its up there with my favourites in that price range old pultenay and macallan and will buy again and again  i love this delicious fruity and spicy lots going on and definitely one of my favourites a must try  i enjoy this drink specifically for the lack of peat this is my afternoon delight when relaxing by the fire the flavors are what i 39 m looking for when poured over the rocks  just picked up a bottle yesterday taking advantage of a 10 price discount not peaty enough for me tried again today hoping my palate had changed it may have but i 39 m still not detecting peat  one of my favorites and at the price point definitely a best best buy excellent i am not a fan of single malts but this balvenie dw 12yo isabove the average i shouldn 39 t buy it too often 128515  sweet and accessible but with good depth of flavour an absolute classic a malt which will probably be enjoyed more by smooth cognac lovers than hardened scotch enthusiasts fortunately i love them both and this is just a bridge between 2 lovers  echo the last couple of reviews the last bottle i got is totally different to the one prior to the point where i ve been wondering if i ve ended up with a fake not bought from here i must stress really disappointed  i don t know if they changed something but it used to be smooth with sherry and floral notes now it s quite smoky  i have been drinking the double wood 12 yr for many years the last bottle i bought is so different prior the scotch had floral notes where this latest bottle has very smoking overtones i am not liking this so will think twice about buying it again  i used to love the balvenie doublewood but haven 39 t had in awhile just picked up a bottle and it is peaty never had this taste profile before or this much peat did they mistakenly bottle one of their peat week styles in this anyone experience this weird  indeed it was the whisky that lead me to whisky drinking bought for me as a leaving present by a scotsman who also enjoys it loverly vanilla and caramel notes for me even down to the drags  my go to scotch when i m feeling unadventurous sweet and smooth can never go wrong from time to time i can always taste a hint of caramel for something reason  received as a retirement gift and what a fine one it turned out to be i 39 ve tried many single malts and have found them to all be different with their own distinct characteristics and flavor this is among the best in my opinion try it if you haven 39 t already you may not like it as much as i do but you will most likely enjoy it  one of the best about in this price range best 12 years old malt have tried quite a few this is my go to though don 39 t know why  had my first sampling of it at home this afternoon what a wonderful surprise definitely a new favorite looking forward to experiencing more samples and flavors as i become familiar with your products tip of the hat to those involved in the making and keeping of this whisky  how this has only got 4 stars is a crime i realise taste is subjective but you will not find a more balanced interesting amp delightful whisky than this for under 163 40 i challenge you  one of the best bang for your buck whisky 39 s out there at this price point this flavourful dram is a great everyday scotch for developed palates and budding enthusiasts alike  my first try of balvenie thanks to the samples available initially flavourful quickly went flat like water in the mouth i see why people would like it but its not for me i had the springbank 10 last night which embarrassed this b12 dw i 39 m just happy i didnt buy a full bottle for the price when for me 163 40 can get some better bottles more to my liking give it a try with the sample bottles if you 39 re tempted its worth a try but dont trust the reviews a hard truth i have learnt is how subjective whisky is so give it a go you may love it sorry i am sold on to what people call donkey urine give me a talisker ardmore laphoraig lagavalin over this overpriced thing any day  quite simply sublime sweet but smooth a lovely tipple i just enjoy this whiskey can 39 t be more real than that it 39 s just good  lovely taste definitely get again too sweet lacks character even black label has much better character kid amongst men over rated  i enjoy many varieties of whiskies which temp and enlighten my palate this is my first bottle of doublewood it is truly unique and a delight wonderful notes are most easily enjoyed if you let your dram breathe for 10 minutes or so try it  one of my favourites this my favourite balvenie  this dram seems to ride the fence separating the pleasantly sweet single malts glenmorangie lasanta for example and the oaky spicier malts yielding a dominant harshness reminiscent of something younger than 12 years not terrible and not even bad but far from a great sip especially for the 60 price i paid unable to outdo monkey shoulder at double the price  excellent one dimensional your first couple of drams you think its the best scotch on earth because of how smooth it is and the minor complexity of the drink but after a few more drams it becomes the most underwhelming drink ever not worth even close to a 100 canadian i 39 ve tried 10 different types of single malt scotches and the only one i despise more than this is the aberfeldy 12 but for the price the aberfeldy is a steal compared to this overpriced crap  a very good whisky that has fast become my go to tipple enjoyed over ice with a drop of water or neat sweet and full of flavour my palate is not sophisticated enough to describe the taste sensations in detail but balvenie doublewood 12 doesn t disappoint and is a fabulous single malt at this price point  one of the best 163 40 whiskies you will ever try smooth and the flavours all hit at the right time one of the first single malts i 39 ve ever bought and what a delicious dram  for the price it 39 s not a bad one on the nose it 39 s an oak and smooth feel it has a hint of spice yet its very inviting plenty going on the taste is fine some flavours coming out but it 39 s not in your face perhaps a drink for new drinkers but have to be honest there could be better out there for the money but i 39 m not suggesting this is a bad drink at all  a must for any collection  smoother and fruitier than most not as much of a smokey flavour coming through would have expected this though as it s not a west coast scotch peach notes hit the tongue with delight with a lasting taste of toffee impressed with another excellent speyside export  strong fruit and toffee on the nose with hints of butterscotch and vanilla palate is dryer than expected with long warm aftertaste ideal winter warner but not as rich as the nose would suggest  an eminently drinkable whisky on the nose i got immediately lemon and green apples taste gave me butteryness honey flavors and bakewell tart finish is sweet and subdued but very pleasant i prefer wilder whiskys so in that sense this is probably not fitting the best for me personally but as a whisky to just enjoy it 39 s pretty good and at the price difficult to fault how people can hammer it i do not know i can understand it not fitting with what you want from a whisky but it is so pleasant that i cannot see how it could be lambasted i think a first time whisky drinker couldn 39 t do much better a very approachable whisky  as a big whisky drinker this is far the best one to purchase stunning in flavours smooth i bought several other balvenie 39 s like caribbean cask single barrel from here when i had quarterly bonuses all the balvenie 39 s are stunning tastes you won 39 t be disappointed i went to dufftown just for balvenie best holiday i ever had  excellent sweet as you 39 d expect from a speyside but very well balanced lovely smooth finish  kinda fun reading all the comments i loved it 128522 a good whiskey for the money around 460 swedish kronor ofc there is better whiskeys but this one is pretty damn good  smooth sweet and an aftertaste you don 39 t want to get rid of  great taste at a reasonable price there are better sherried drams that are similar and don t use artificial coloring like bunnahabhain however this is very good and easy to find not a sherry bomb by any means but you can tell it s there  this is really quite good unfortunately i started my scotch journey later in life thus i find this scotch in the 50 range us in that 50 39 ish category of scotches this one is a leap beyond the base line three 39 glens 39 and far more complex i really enjoy this one and given its ready availability will likely return to it again and again the dram is not atypical of speyside balvenie but still offers a complex and unique profile only the hardest of peat heads could possibly find much fault with this one  this is quite a sweet whisky which is probably why i like it so much an absolutely delicious flavour profile of honey vanilla and cinnamon and a mild but satisfying heat at the end very moreish it would probably be easy to drink the bottle if you got carried away  like this one does have nice flavours but it is slightly sweet for the price you cant go wrong with always have a bottle in the house and whenever friends and family come round it comes out which always goes down well  very pleasant nose of dried sweet fruits spices with cinnamon among them and then to my delight you get honeycomb which is really inviting did also pick up some tones of vanilla caramel which is thanks to the american oak barrel swirling in the mouth this balvenie is very lean and round at first with gentle spices and a touch of vanilla then after a few seconds there is a natural burn with more hints of dried fruits dark chocolate sherry and some oak everything so well balanced almost thought it said the balance on the bottle the finish was also very gentle and round truly giving me reminders of bourbon but has its own character as a speyside single malt delighted i will definitely try the other drams from balvenie  this is my favourite single malt of all time 2nd goes to ardbeg smooth with lovely taste been on the balvenie tour at 25 quid then get your hands on balvenie rose for 100 quid  my first experience with single malts was with the islay scotches tried some balvenie 12 yr old about a year ago and really enjoyed it has a really warm spicy finish that i like plus price for a single malt of this calibre is very reasonable i must try the 14 yr old caribbean cask  just beginning to get into my whiskeys have tried a few now and this has a very short smooth finish will try again  mildly sweet pleasant a little bland smooth and short finish probably would buy macallan 12 springbank 10 or tullibardine 228 instead next time waste of money was gifted a bottle a few years ago before really appreciating whisky and thought it was okay drank half and left it on the shelf until recently when the other half opened a bottle she had lately i 39 ve begun to really appreciate proper whisky gin and rum and found it a fantastic dram highly enjoyable and full of flavour  whisky muy suave y sabroso ideal para relajarse despu 233 s del trabajo fant 225 stico subtle on the nose very smooth i agree that it is great for beginners looking to move on from blends i give this a 5 star taking into account the low price enjoy  nose quite citrusy nutty and can definitely get the grapes palate is just amazing you taste the transition from bourbon to a sherry cask perfect example of aging in two casks slight spiciness kicks in at the end together with glenfiddich i would give this to a beginner single malt drinker  a distinctive puke tasting note  a great classic dram for most occasions i personally love the b12 dw in all its entirely this is a definitive speyside represent overall good value for money and a choice bottle to bring to casual and formal occasions dried fruit and apricots on the nose nuts hints of vanilla and balanced acetone but not overpowering to give that edge when one chooses to have it over rocks or neat or just a few drops of water to soften it really opens up well on its on or as a cocktail slight peat and spicy pear on the finish dry but not long  one of my favourites and strangely preferred the 12 over the 17 personally thought it had more flavour really excellent for that price  discovering new layers complex enough for mature palates vibrant colour subtle flavours sterling whisky new favourite  life is all about balance and variation is the christmas spice of life most of my cupboard is full of smoking steaming brutes from islay but some nights are better suited to a leather armchair and a smoking jacket sipping something sweeter and altogether more gentle on the central cortex there are lots of sherried choices but not so many in your local supermarket for 163 30 at such a good quality so for me it 39 s a must buy along with dalwhinnie  layers of flavor and exceptional smoothness great every day dram subtle spice and sweet without being cloying this is my favourite whisky of all time a real classic  sterling whisky excellent colour robust flavours centre ground in terms of quality  absolutely beautiful whisky trying my first drink right now the bottle was a gift but it already has become my favorite  amazing scotch whisky well worth the money no thanks too sweet one dimensional and a short lacking finish save your monies and buy something worth while  i 39 ve avoided scotch for years preferring bourbon but balvenie 12 year doublewood won me over smooth and delightful enjoyable on a fall evening in maine when the grandchildren have gone home or they are asleep and it 39 s just the misses and me  if you have a real sweet tooth you might like balvenie doublewood for me this whiskey falls below the minimum acceptable quality for a single malt avoid  this is my summer single malt of choice laphroaig is far too heavy for the hotter months and i tried this whisky on a whim and i 39 m glad i did absolutely delicious and very clean on the finish  one of the best sultanas and blackcurrants with a bit of honey bold sweetness on the nose but more complex to taste a hint of smoke to finish fantastic if you like dark fruity flavours like myself  like other two or three star reviews i was disappointed really over hyped dram rrp in sydney is 109 overall its only slightly more complex than glenmorangie 10 or the aberour 12 but 25 more expensive too sweet too much vanilla and honey if you are willing to pay this price for a speyside something like oban 14 offers so much more will not buy again  sweet and treacly with hints of oak a beautiful malt that goes really well with food  smell is inviting fruit and honey although i can pick up some dried fruit it mostly just tastes hot and salty improved considerably with a splash of water but still overpowering  we stumbled upon this whisky by chance a number of years ago yaay we absolutely love this whisky the honey tones are delicious and the amber liquid enfolds your tongue  had it for the first time last time i was home normally a glenmorangie drinker but was quite surprised at this one delicious well balanced with good body hints of cinnamon honey and a slight smoky finish wonderful for the price  wow this is too good to review you wont be dsisapointed believe me this is the stuff others are trying to create 10 out of 10 i personally never buy single malts my son selected balvenie doublewood as a birthday gift other single malts i 39 ve tried were lacking in depth breadth of flavor profile this is a very pleasing flavor balance in keeping with my personal blended scotch favorites i 39 ll likely buy it for special occasions  in addition to the above i detect a little apricot in the nose as well the nuttiness certainly stands out too i get a strong whiff of hazelnuts it 39 s certainly very inviting mmmmmm but to the taste creamy smooooooth so lovely so easy to drink and yet so very beautifully balanced it 39 s immediate love for me and easily upon my list of re purchasables l agree with the above stated finish it 39 s definitely sweet and in fact i get a soft malted toffee plenty of toffee in the finish its just superb omg wonderful its simply syrupy deliciousness i 39 ve also tried the triple cask 12 year for me this is streets ahead overall in character maturity and general appeal a very welcomed member to my family off whisky favorites thank you balvenie  the first time i tried this it was my first dive into whiskies of this region and ended up enjoying a few too many glasses with my dad alongside his laphroaig both very easy sips yet very different i grabbed a bottle for myself and would advise putting this in the freezer and then pouring yourself a nice good sized glass the natural sweetness of this whisky makes it a delightful sip mainly as it 39 s best left to breath a little but chilling it means you can dive straight in and enjoy the journey as the glass warms in your hands each sip gets ever so much more flavourful for its price i would say it 39 s amazing value although keep half an eye out as it comes on offer fairly frequently  really smooth mellow whiskey easy to drink nose cinnamon sultanas and spices palate mild white peppery bourbon with sultanas dried apricot finish bourbonthis is not a bad whiskey instead i would like to talk about value i had the johnnie walker black for 38 cad the aberlour 10 on sale for 43 cad the auchentoshan 12 for 46 suntory tori for 53 now i bought the balvenie doublewood 12 for 70 cad for every extra 5 you paid you get a little bit extra if you ask me which one to buy then i must say get the johnnie walker black for 38 cad or just throw in a few dollars more and go higher e g nikka from the barrel lagavulin 16 or balvenie 14 caribbean cask of the same brand or even glenfarclas 15 for 70 cad one would expect more  newcomer to single malt whisky and this is my favourite so far always thought the quot smells of a damp meadow quot brigade were abit pretentious but after trying a couple of whisky 39 s i am myself starting to pick out different secnts and tastes this is the first whisky i can definitely smell and taste properly and it 39 s marvelous i get oranges dates vanilla and the longer it 39 s in the glass toffee can 39 t wait to try some more but this will always have a place in my cabinet  has a sweet and spicey flavour that 39 s quite unique never overpowering  fantastic speyside  a single malt that punches well above its weight a taste that holds just a bit longer happy days family bought me 2 for christmas  the balvenie doublewood 12 yo is an excellent example of the fruits of double maturation honey vanilla bit of bourbon bit of sherry fruit slight floral the nose the palate and the finish are in harmony perfect for a warm evening on the deck or a late night beside the fire imho an extraordinary value  another of the light drams that i have enjoyed in the calendar fruity sweet with that taste of honey on the nose fruity and moderately spicy on the palate and though short a memorable finish that favors the spice  on the 12th day of christmas balvenie 12 doublewood always a great dram of speyside at a reasonable price lots of malt wood and vanilla a little spice a thick mouth full had it in a dram neat certain whiskeys don 39 t need a tip or maybe i was just to lazy to get up to get water doesn 39 t matter it was nice  delicious for years i had been a blanton 39 s single barrel drinker not anymore it is a easy drink and smooth  lovely malt whisky haven 39 t tried this before but had it as a present for my 50th goes down really well will get another best present highly recommend  very fine drink drinking neat musky wood milk chocolate amp orange honey fruit grape cherry cereal vanilla custard spicy sherry decadent sweet burnt sugar birthday candle short finish a very enjoyable little speyside it 39 s very similar to a brandy with the fruits and spice but the added vanilla custard honey round it out and make it its own drinking neat let sit for 1 hour it has definitely become more brandy like it has mellowed and the flavors have meld into a syrupy fruity vanilla substance the milk chocolate and musky wood as faded i tastes better without sitting but this is still very good  always love this classic 12yr great flavor and balance a must have for my scotch cabinet  fill stars enjoyable smooth whiskey in mexico we get the 43 it 39 s very good and balanced perfect for after a nice dinner someone below said it is harsh compared to jw platinum well pretty much any single malt is harsher than a 18 yo blended whisky single malt whisky is supposed to be more intense  fairly thick coatline and legs run slowly indicating high viscosity nose very sweet figs sultanas estery vanilla caramel honey citrus coming through oaky sulphur coming through if left to air for 20 mins or more probably due to burning of sulphur candles to fumigate the oloroso casks sweetness diiminishes a fair bit after 30mins or more palate very sweet demerara sugar caramel honey a little spicy finish short to medium length sweetness dominates conclusion imo too sweet would be interesting to know which fill went into the american oak casks first at one point i thought i caught s little smoke but could be my imagination  was a little dissapointed did have a harshness to it prefer jw gold or platinum around same price  balance is the best word i can think of to describe this wonderful single malt double wood aging is not a gimmick it vastly improves an deepens the flavor the first time i split a bottle of this it was very nice smooth and a little sweet the 2nd bottle i picked up though had a real harsh tang to it though could just be a bad bottle so i 39 d still recommend this definitely one to let breath though and a drop of water doesn 39 t do any harm  i have been drinking scotch for many years mostly in the realm of glenlivet 15 glenmorangie port and glenmorangie sherry seems that is my price range i 39 m not a smokey or a peat lover rather the smoothness of balvenie doublewood has met my needs and taste  nice scotch but not a great single malt balvenie dbl wood has increased in price substantially more than glenlivit and glennfiddich why i was predominantly a balvenie fan for years as it was a decent scotch at a decent price for average to better value in this past 18 months grant amp sons kept pushing pricing too aggressively it simply wasn 39 t and isn 39 t worth the premium they ask vs other solid single malts markets are a fragile thing  granted i 39 m a laphraoig fan which is distinctly different i 39 m fine with chivas and enjoy auchentoshan i was underwhelmed by balvenie perhaps just my unsophisticated palate but it tasted harsh and average sorry  excelente calidad y excelente whisky de malta  bought this for the first time in a few years today because it wasn 39 t overly priced which it typically is here in cali nowadays and i 39 m glad i did because it 39 s just as good as i remember it being so smells like cinnamon apples and candied hazelnuts tastes like sweet sherried oak caramel toffee raisins orange peels cinnamon and honey an absolute pleasure to drink this is one of the whiskies that got me into scotch and is probably the best introduction to speyside whisky in my opinion definitely a classic very flavorful goes down smooth too bad it 39 s getting so expensive the sugarbear soak some dirtypeat alcohol in good old usa bourbon barrels then finish it in slimy european wine casks let it stew for a long time in a scottish sheep hovel overprice it and sell it to the stupid colonists brilliant  i got me a bottle and my first glass wasn 39 t impressive the more i had it the more i started to love it it is really a great whisky and one that i will buy from time to time if i had to compare to another whisky it would be macallan 12 although the macallan has more of a woody flavour i think they are very similiar but slightly prefer the macallan  top job from balvenie so easy to sit and drink this whisky straight or with a bit of ice if required overwhelming new horizons this has become my whisky of choice i love it it is gentle while at the same time so interesting and full on the palate it takes up my full attention and tells me so many new things as i linger on it  the old 15 was miles above the 12 i 39 m very unimpressed with it a glendronach 12 blows away the bal dw and the glendronach is 15 cheaper i wonder afield in the scotch world and always go back to balvenie flavorful with a hint of peat and sweetness that reminds me of scotland  great buy  from a neat pour there 39 s initially a light chocolaty sweetness orange with sandalwood and metallic notes lingering on the nose those later gave way to overripe pears musty damp oak burnt orange and cinnamon buns the palate is undeniably smooth but overpowered with medicinal notes reminiscent of cough syrup disappointingly despite some complexity i found it difficult to locate any definitive sweetness just an unpleasant harshness the numbing finish presented bittersweet cocoa that trailed off into an herbal fatty note 224 la fenneled genoa salami i received this as a sample from the chaps as master of malt and unless it was mislabeled found it difficult to agree with their tasting notes admittedly i am not a fan of first fill sherry perhaps the sulphured quot spice quot it can impart is not to my liking but either way i expected warm comforting carameled oak somewhere in the spirit just couldn 39 t find it for the same price i personally prefer the sweet spiced peat kissed maltiness and firmer palate of springbank 10 think i 39 ll stick with that  one of the most enjoyable malts i have had the pleasure of tasting well worth the money amp would have paid more knowing how good it was  i 39 m completely aghast at the total lack of objectivity in these reviews if it doesn 39 t taste good it isn 39 t this one tastes good smooth enough to drink anytime you so desire complex enough to please any educated palate no obnoxious sulphury peat taste if i wanted sulphur i 39 d chew a kitchen match smoke your cigar later enjoy this now by the way it won 39 t break the bank cheers  this is a great scotch its sweet up front but robust thereafter not overly powerful but well rounded taste no distinct peat smokeyness  picked up the balvenie 12 year doublewood on the recommendation from some colleagues who rave about their longer aged bottlings this one was fairly affordable and a good introduction to balvenie and speyside whisky in general i can see what people mean when they say it 39 s a beginner 39 s or introductory speyside single malt while it isn 39 t the most complex and challenging whisky around especially in it 39 s price range of 70 a bottle where i live in texas and the finish is a tad lacking ralfy mentions this in his review of the dw 12 and i agree completely i still find some positives in this whisky that make it worth having in the cabinet the nose is fantastic it 39 s got a wonderful light and refreshing spice and citrus smell to it the taste is more of that with some good sweetness to it not much beyond that but what it does have is quite enjoyable i like it enough that i try not to blow through the bottle and look forward to tasting it and sharing it with others i would definitely purchase it again when it 39 s finished  bought this after i read about it here just what i expected thank you guys  i 39 m in the cigar house in old san juan and it goes great with a gloria cubana serie r  i 39 ve been drinking single cask malt whiskeys for years at about 163 50 163 70 from sunday times wine club i was given this doublewood 12 as a present and i was impressed so i hit the internet to see what it was worth now i 39 m really impressed i will definitely be ordering more of this amp less of the single cask bottles i am not a connoisseur but i can tell the good from the bad and this is good  i was given a bottle of this for my 6oth birthday and have to congratulate you for the best whiskey on the market today well done 5stars from me  doesn 39 t exhibit many clear faults but it strikes me as hot and lacking subtlety  . not as good as i thought it would be loved the smokiness though  lovely  simply a luscious single malt that enlightened my palate i drank this while watching nick offerman drink a whisky at a fireplace it has an odd nose straight up spices probably what the description above calls quot gristy quot but i 39 m not familiar with that term on the tongue it was good just enough peat to be fun but a little rough at times caught in my throat a bit but it was a good experience final note i am doing the 2015 advent calendar as a result i get one drink at it to decide if i like it enough to buy more sometimes i need to drink something three or four times to make up my mind thus my rating is based on a one time drink experience  my scotch collection will never lack this bottle incredible value for a creation that now stands out as the perfect ambassador for speyside distillers  absolutely love this whiskey so smooth with lots of different flavours i don 39 t enjoy having my mouth incinerated like some whiskeys have a tendencyto do this is the total opposite and i will buy it now regularly  sure glenlivet and glenfiddich are okay in a pinch but when you want to keep it near 50 with a reason to spend and a reason to enjoy the balvenie is the way to go many fond memories and hopefully many more to come take it in  another great value from the gents at balvenie try it before you buy it or just go for it with this decent price on a great whisky  was a big fan of the double wood but the bottles that do not have the signature on the bottle to me are not as good as the bottles that have the signature on the bottle themselves  i fucken loved it not bad but this is nothing compare to other the balvenie bottles like caribean cask the 15 sherry or the 17 years old i suggest you go higher on that scale to fully appriciate the bavelnie potential  smell it take drink and hold it for a few moments swirl exhale through your nose swallow slow fantastic  very good distillate great nose and taste no brainer for the price  a bit of novice but we have settled on balvinie 12 stopped buying others in this price range that didn 39 t compare  as sweet as a cognac almost some other interesting things happening on the palate one poster here even described it as somewhat bourbon like i 39 d agree with that definitely has its own unique taste profile a pretty solid single malt that stands up to its higher priced more aged peers  light to medium mouth light spice on tongue nice sweetness then fades and is slightly annoying and back to being nice ahhh it s aged in sherry casks which always bothers me  i opened this bottle when i got it and slowly drank a few drams over a couple weeks then let it set for a couple weeks first pours were not very dramatic or inspiring having let the bottle sit for a couple weeks almost 3 4 full it has changed for the better i m not sure what the deal is with some single malts that change after opening and letting sit for a couple or more weeks but some change with dramatic flair this is one of them the nose is now far more supple and inviting vanilla is more pronounced with the fruit side pallet is way better and a tad sweeter though the finish is kind of short i just cant stop nosing this one will be buying this one again  amazing just want to keep going like thirst for water  got a bottle as a fathers day gift outstanding taste with the mixture of the two woods  i 39 ve been drinking single malts for a few years now and for the price i haven 39 t found anything better started with the 12yo balvenie and kept coming back to it exactly because of what most people who like it say it 39 s a nice easy drink and doesn 39 t disappoint can anyone suggest an alternative for the price  i must say that it 39 s overpriced it would be acceptable for 20 30 less money reminds me too much of bourbon however we all have a different palate and if you like it by all means go for it it 39 s not bad but it 39 s not for everybody i don 39 t want to drag down the rating so i 39 m not rating it  and it went down smooth my first balveine at the time it was recommended by a co worker i enjoy the 12 14 15 and 21 year the older the better with balveine  i was a bourbon drinker got a bottle of doublewood and i am now a scotch lover this stuff is honestly amazing you cannot tell you 39 re sipping 90 proof whisky when this swirls around your mouth  i 39 m mainly a beer amp wine guy and i dabble into ky bourbon from time to time but i lately started to explore single malt scotch and decided to start with balvenie doublewood 12 year incredible though i 39 ve tasted different scotches before this was my first bottle of scotch that i 39 ve bought very smooth texture and magnificent flavors if you 39 re new to scotch like me this is a great one to start with the peaty scotches of islay are a little too smoky and strong for me right now but i 39 m sure i 39 ll warm up to them eventually but my first impression with scotch is a very good one thanks to balvenie 12 year old doublewood  i 39 ve been exploring quot budget quot scotches for quite some time and it is getting harder and harder for me to find a 40 60 bottle of scotch that i haven 39 t tried yet that being said this is as good a bottle of scotch as there is in the 40 60 price range you simply will not find a better more balanced and warm single malt out there the initial palate impressions are vanilla brown sugar and a little spice the thing i really enjoy about this scotch is the texture it is much cleaner than some of the other cheaper tripled distilled scotches out there it fills your mouth and the flavor coats your entire palate not just the specific sensory buds on the tip of your tongue and back of your throat the finish is quick with not a lot of lingering woodiness i love this scotch and it has become my go to standard i have had some very experienced scotch drinkers blind taste test this against much more expensive and longer aged bottles and they consistently pick the balvenie over the others don 39 t listen to the negative reviews this is a little budget gem of a whiskey  superb smooth as silk  never stop nice balanced perfect for a malt beginner as myself love the name doublewood is the way to go good scotch tastes like scotch however i have trouble believing that they are the only distillery that malts in their own traditional floor maltings and still employs a team of coppersmiths that can 39 t be true  i had this at a whisky bar and loved it got notes of raisins pound cake green apple corn and vanilla among many other things i went out and bought a bottle naturally and was a little disappointed in how as many people have stated mellow and middle of the road it is as an islay fan i do appreciate a nice fruity sweet break now and again but i still have a lot more to explore and i feel i could find it 39 s equal without too much searching  like other reviewers have noted the balvenie doublewood 12 may seem a bit too smooth almost to the point of being bland i decided to mix it with about 10 to 15 talisker 10 and i think the combination is better than either one its own  i 39 ve spent the last couple months trying every 12 y o scotch i could get my hands on i 39 m up to nearly a dozen 8 or 9 single malts and a couple blends so far the balvenie doublewood 12 is far and away my favorite the macallan and glenfiddich would be a distant second and third wonderful nose warm and spicy more than reasonably priced now on to some more mature offerings think i 39 ll start with the doublewood 17  the price is what keeps this dram highly perched on my shelves it 39 s one to always have on hand as a daily dram thats exactly what this is safe cozy and reliable there is some kind of plastic taste mid palate but otherwise is wonderful i would expect more bite from a more expensive scotch but at forty bills the vanilla and inoffensive flavor profile are just what i want yea the finish is short but really you want a lengthy lingering finish at this price point with that same thick gummy flavor and body you 39 re dreaming at this price if you want all of that that 39 s going to cost upwards of at least 65 00 here is cali and more elsewhere this is the kind of drop that should be regularly stocked on every scotch drinkers shelves for its affordability and reliability if you 39 re loaded then by all means complain and buy a higher whisky if you 39 re like the rest is us be grateful this balvenie exists and is always available and affordable  i too prefer to peatier more robust malts but found this offering to be quite enjoyable and refreshing nonetheless plenty of honey sweet notes joined by vanilla and a slight nuttiness even picked up some very slight lemon notes unless my olfacctorys misfired a bit more of an alcohol burn than i would expect from a seemingly gentle scotch but nothing overwhelming the finish is warm though i agree with others that it disappears in short order medium length finish is a reasonable statement certainly would consider this as a quot go to quot whisky when i 39 m looking for something different than an islay but that 39 s not very often  this dram is quality and complexity and simplicity achieved at a great price point i have a well rounded and experienced profile for scotch whisky thus can confidently say that for forty dollars here in california this offering from balvenie should be a go to for he serious scotch drinker for all the flavoring notes and such read the description atop and other reviewers who reflect that they are right on it is fruity yet resonant with deeper notes oak and a thread of sherry the only accusation i can agree to is that it doesn 39 t hang around extraordinary long i 39 d say the finish is of medium length not short the nose is inviting with nuts and vanilla it is smooth on the palate with just enough spice this is a wonderful 12 year old and you won 39 t find many 12 39 s that can come close to this at such affordable price it is my quintessential daily dram for a man with a modest to above average budget  repugnant smell and taste like a bourbon full body very warm full of honey and vanilla may the best malt i have ever tasted  i usually opt for the peatier drams ardbeg lagavulin laphroaig but for my nightly quot sip quot i sometimes need a break from that genre a little variety and the balvenie 12 is a perfect option complex and rich enough to satisfy that stronger palate yet has a smoothness and some gentler notes that offer the regular scotch drinker a very satisfying choice highly recommended  awesome baby this was a gift from my son he received a recommendation from a friend who drinks scotch i first noticed the sweet smell of sherry and the rich tasteon my first sip i also though it went down smooth it 39 s the best 12yr old that i tasted so far i 39 m surprised anyone would rate it a 2 i would rate your 12yr doublewood 4 stars plus doublewood was one of the first malts i had and i 39 ll always remember it was the very first one that made me say quot wow quot and opened my eyes to how good whisky is i tried it again recently and now having about 80 90 different malts under my belt i thought there was no way it was going to live up to my high expectations based on the memory of my first experience but it absolutely did there are very few whiskies of the same age or price range that i rate higher than doublewood it 39 s a stunner  lovely nose of character but it stops there once on the lips there is a harsh burn and a bland taste the finish is very short it needs maturing in better quality oak and why do they only give it 2 months in the sherry cask there are plenty of much better 12 year old speysides around not recommended i love this whiskey i tried the 17 year old version and was disappointed as i couldn 39 t find much difference so just get this instead  the body was a nice surprise really recommend for after dinner fuller body slightly sweet with honey and cinnamon not terribly complex but do not pass it up a perfect winter warmer  nice dram rich but sweet bourbon like nose silky and sweet taste vanilla and lots of honey medium long pleasant relaxing finish overall a neatly packed whisky that gets better with every glass not to be missed  classic spayside and so pleasant to drink you may prefer a differnt style but how anyone can say its not a great whisky is totaly beyond me  i have tried many scotches and by far this is my favorite plain and simple i 39 ve found the doublewood to be smooth with a slight bite the taste is buttery and similar to the recent explosion of honey drinks i enjoy the drink and will continue my pursuit of the ultimate drink for my palette  rushed the first too exited with the smooth taste and ended up drunk the smoothness and sweetness goes well together i like the taste and absence of any bitter food colouring aftertaste bitterness 10 10 for taste value and the bottle looks really nice with the wide lip  this whiskey has to be one of the very best 12 year bottles around great taste and very smooth give it a go you will not be disapointed  excellent stuff that s all needs too be said cheers i originally bought this down in devon when staying with an ex partner this helps bring back warm memories the nose is subtle grape a distantly rich sweet touch in there on the palate i get a nice sensation of sublte spice and vanilla very smooth perfect for a summer evening or relaxing by a fire the finish is dry and warming a slight lingering of spicers leaving you pleased and wanting more  i bought this whisky because it got some really good reviews boy was i disappointed simply put it s flat the nose is alright but the palate and finish are disappointing i would expect this from some young spirit and it s not the only balvenie that gets the flat mark either they should get their act together sooner rather then later i am going elsewhere for my dram  the vitriol used to describe a whisky is narcissistic and condescending why is it not enough to say that you d prefer another i m not a connoisseur of whiskies in part because i don t know what that is but i have partaken for some 45 years and this is the best tasting whiskey i ve had but if you find comfort in denigrating someone else s tastes go ahead we partake as a pleasure not as a measurement of one s character  i believe review about two down from this is spot on quot accept it for what it is quot however o would submit their two stars rating is unfairly low i too wish the finish was more complex and longstanding but it is a smooth supple drink and the finish is pleasant this is an easy recommendation for a new scotch drinker zum wohl w my son bought me a bottle of balvenie doublewood 12 year old for father s day now i m not a whisky guru i know nought of vanilla spice or bourbon finishing or interesting characteristics or personality this is a damn good drop of five star liquor ideal for the world cup or any other sporting event value for money yes i enjoy tasting different styles palates finish of whisky s yes there are some that dont leave a big impression or i had high expectations but didnt deliver this one was somewhere in between the bourbon sherry characters i like i just wish the finish was more complex and lasted longer  nice smooth cask influence but that s about it this scotch whisky doesn t really have interesting characteristics or a personality of its own  good malt newbie people to scotch deceiving this one comments like these one are proof of that quot tastes too much like a bourbon wannabe quot quot being aged in bourbon barrels may be doing this scotch a bit of a disservice quot about 90 of all scotch whisky is matured in ex bourbon cask http www maltmadness com malt whisky beginners guide 05 maturation html even your non scotch drinking mom will be begging for another refill great intro into the world of quot sweeter quot malts  this stuff isn t worth the hype yes it s smooth but that s about it tastes too much like a bourbon wannabe for a single malt price you ll get more bang for your buck with elijah craig there s just no there there  i am new to scotch balvenie 12 year double was recommended to me and i am sold smooth flavorful and easy to drink awesome  a very average whisky a bit uninspiring really so many better ones out there in the price bracket  if you can find a better balance for the price let me know i ll have two  enjoy my first bottle of balvenie dw back in 1994 in nyc after sampling many single malts in the range of 50 to 120 u all i can say is that subdue me forever now 20 year later almost 50 years old and with a decent drinking experience i amcertain it will remain my number 1 i have been drinking balvenie doublewood for a great many years those who are critical of this superb malt cannot possibly know what they are talking about  this would be great if labeled as a bourbon and it is very smooth as far as bourbons go however because i was looking for a good scotch i was disappointed with this there was just the slightest tinge of scotch hidden in there somewhere but bourbon was the predominant flavor being aged in bourbon barrels may be doing this scotch a bit of a disservice something i wish i had thought of before spending as much as i did you could get a comparable bourbon for less than a bottle of this and be equally satisfied  i had a bottle of this and i did not like it i have been drinking various single malts lately and found it to offer special did not like the aftertaste in particular also noticed that on the second day of the taste was actually worse i honestly tried to like it but found that it is not to my taste i thought it tasted like medicine in my opinion there is much better scotches within the price range  very nutty in both aroma and flavor nose also has butterscotch and banana smooth flavor brief but satisfying finish a soothing dram very enjoyable  accompanied with marios suvla all the way from cyprus we had a bottle this afternoon and it was amazing very smooth soft and no shionis highly recommended at a great price must have whisky great as an appertif runs flat wife loves it great for the price think the irish may like this  in that range price it s one on the smoothest it s certainly an incredible one to start you collection and it become an easy point of reference when you explore others  i m normally a bourbon drinker but this scotch may have just moved me to the other side slightly sweet the sherry finish is notable with a buttery hint a beautiful scotch and perfect first scotch taste five stars  i enjoyed this drink with my wife and we are very happy to have it mathew sahane n gretta sahane  pleasant nose the palate begins with a somewhat soapy element i cannot describe well rest is not very complex bit of spicy vanilla short finish it is not a bad whiskey but both dalwhinnie and glenmorangie of same price class i prefer  nice indeed better than some of the more generic stuff not as good as glenfarclas but decent  yeah i like all the balvenies not quite at the level at the dalmore but a step up from glenmorangies and highland park etc really drinkable and i always have a bottle in my cupboard jason breen it s not bad at all and better after it s had a few weeks open nice dam not too complicated but enough going on a decent drop  hate this whisky yuuukkk it s all nutmeg vanilla and wood plus some green apple the doublewood is an okay starter scotch but there exist much better oak themed malts for instance the auchentoshan 12 is at the same level note that this malt improves with oxidation as it starts to pick up some caramel notes  it s all nutmeg vanilla and wood plus some green apple the doublewood is an okay starter scotch but there exist much better oak themed malts for instance the auchentoshan 12 is at the same level note that this malt improves with oxidation as it starts to pick up some caramel notes  it s a very nice whisky great as a first venture into single malt i do prefer the glenlivet 12yo over this one though which is also a little cheaper  very smooth and strong first time i ve ever had this scotch i used to drink scotch about 30 years ago and gave it up for wine got this for a 60th birthday present and it is very very nice smooth with a bit of a bite i will go easy on this or i might revert back to 30 years ago  first time i ve ever had this scotch i used to drink scotch about 30 years ago and gave it up for wine got this for a 60th birthday present and it is very very nice smooth with a bit of a bite i will go easy on this or i might revert back to 30 years ago  hate to disagree with the majority but considering the price i found this to be a little harsh almost like a blended whisky i prefer my old standby glenlivet 18 year old scotch over this it does have quite a kick though  i don t know of another quality scotch that can charm a beginner s palate quite like the doublewood 12 year it s very inviting has all the qualities one looks for in a speyside but in gentle non threatening proportions it won t scare a beginner away my first scotch tasting was a laphroig perpetrated as a trick by an uncle with a dubious sense of humor that first sip sadly kept me away from all scotches even bland blends for nearly a decade today it s my favorite bottle but i had to earn its virtues a concept that would have been lost on me as a tyro when my 17 year old daughter turns 18 later this year she s been promised a sampling from any bottle in the cabinet but i m going to use what s left of my waning paternal influence and suggest her first scotch to be this doublewood i love this bottle and i love her more so it makes good sense to pair the two after that she s on her own unless she wants my advice anymore which i hope she will  i found the sherry cask to add nothing to the whisky a good solid whisky but for an extra taste i ld look at penderyn  balvenie doublewood 12 year old scotch is hands down the finest single malt scotch on the market for the price the 60 day sherry cask barrel finish gives this beauty a taste of smooth yet complex notes with a flavour that lingers in oaken and off vanilla hints cheers  for the price it doesn t get much better warm caramel and honey deliciousness  i enjoyed a bottle of this but felt it slightly lacking in depth in a way i cant really explain maybe ive been spoiled by other better whisky s of a similar taste theme but id rather spend a little more and get something i really enjoy still 7 10 i love this whisky it is very smooth and quite good served on the rocks i usually prefer my whisky served neat but something in the flavor happens to this one served over ice enjoy  after the monkey shoulders i tried this one and so happy i did it is real warm but smooth truly i tasted smelled caramel pear taste buds hold the molecules and never is the throat hurt velvet fiery should i say bought it at the airport tasted it in montreal and felt this welcoming feeling erasing any trouble each time alchemy of whisky blending in personality  i really enjoyed this dram light on the nose with a huge whiff of grapes a solid warm and spicy palate and a nice medium long finish that s plenty dry the oak and the sherry are most evident on the nose while i prefer some of the balvenie s other offerings this is a fine daily scotch at a fantastic price  vanilla honey white pepper spice with a gentle sherry a little nuttiness and light citrus notes this is a smooth subtle whisky with a nice mix that wont tire your palate one to add to the collection and a great one for a first or second dram on a flight  for the price this is a winner every time awesome scotch  despite my heavy islay leanings i have to say that this is one of my favorite scotches smooth but fairly complex and well rounded the more mellow taste imparts an almost buttery quality to the slight oiliness from my experience a great starter scotch too given how many people i ve converted with it  . this was one of my first single malts and i liked it a lot it s a nice whisky to start with if you like full flavour and a little sting but not the peat or smoke  i have tried numerous whiskeys for under 50 and the doublewood takes it it is superior in my opinion to johnny walker red black glenfiddich 12 18 glenlivet 12 dewars white red jack daniels original gentleman single barrel honey southern comfort keep in mind i am rating it against other whiskeys under 50 this is by far the best as a college student i am happy that balvenie produces a whiskey that is affordable even for people like me who want good scotch but can t afford the expensive stuff keep up the good work  cool man i agree with john eva this is pretty much basic speysider not much complexity or character there is much better whiskies in this price range  trying to like this but it offers nothing no fruit no spice nothing but a buzz  not bad but not great either if you can find it on offer from the supermarkets for around 163 25 worth spending the money on it otherwise i can think of a few different whisky s i would prefer for the similar price range  i keep buying doublewood as gifts for my friends since they love it so much and i have yet to add it to my personal inventory the next bottle i purchase will be for myself although i m sure i ll partake in this most recent gift purchase one evening with my local friend i m really looking forward to trying it out i give it a 10 based on how dedicated my friends are to the doublewood variety  i don t know what everyone else thinks i don t care but what i think is this the balvennie double wood s nose is very oaky deep and soft then the taste is mulled whiskey mellowed maturity kindness with substance the finish is medium as one would expect for the price mild but long and gentle yet no bitter taste or sour notes i rate this whiskey as excellent for its price and one of my favourites given its cost the bottle is like a true whiskey with no pretenciousness this is a nice whiskey good for newcomers as it is full of depth from the oak and full of flavour from the sherry it is a gentle honest and a kind whiskey i don t care who you are or whether or you think masterofmalt have posted this this is a post from a true customer and i hope you enjoy the whiskey as i have  me and one of my best friends opened a bottle of this wonderful doublewood and literally finshed the bottle without even notice it the sweetness and the lovely vanilla taste hypnotised us from portugal sorry for my english  title says it all  lovely smooth and pleasant single malt whiskey the evident bourbon and fruity finish will make you cherish the moment awesome taste on the rocks and more over the 43 vol gives an edgy high over common 40 vol malts  a lovely drop not too complex or too simple great almost bourbon tasting scotch love the subtle fruity finish would like the finish to be a little stronger but a great drink one of my favourites the balvenie doublewood is one of my favourite whiskies the sherry influence is discreet and combines really well with the balvenie style this is a rich whisky with a beguiling nose that would be my top recommendation for anyone wishing to get into single malts but this is not merely an introductory or value for money malt i think it s great regardless of the cost the best 12 year old whisky around in my opinion  easy going and delicious feeling pleasure to have it would like to suggest you to have it once in your life whether you drink or not and pe kar ho jao talli cheersssssssssss to people  a delicious and full flavored whisky highly recommended  good value good whisky yet to find another whisky as good smooth and sweet but with just enough bite everytime i have a dram i find something new in the flavours happily complex  tried aberlough to compare it to balvenie 12 the price was very good but there just wasn t the bite that balvenie has balvenie is hard to beat for the price  i ve yet to find anything in this price range that is even half as good wonderful with a pice of ice or drop of water i perfer a clean finish and shy away from alot of smoke  found that when drank straight or with just a drip or two of water was noticeably strong bourbon aging side that he was talking about to my liking like dalwhinnie 15 but a little less of a prickly feel and more toffee vanilla thing going on as well didn t notice any peat lurking not that i minded  i liked the founders reserve it was sweet balanced everything in the right amounts it was not complex or heavily aged at its price range but very mildly pleasing this new double wood when drankstraight or with just a drip or two of water was noticeably strong to me on the bourbon aging side with an overt young green oakiness to it it did finish better with some warm sherry tones in there though i maylike it better over a piece of ice still better than most at this price cheers there isn t much of a sherrywood there just 2 months finishing the finish is too short too the balvenie signature or 15yo single barrel will do honours of this distillery 
2455.0, superb tasting single malt you can 39 t not enjoy this whisky chilled is the way  very smooth but has a subtle smell and taste of germoline very very distinct medical flavour we then read its description with no surprise that it is with iodine and peat flavour  a revelation it 39 s unique a piece of art it came into my life at a great time as i had just quit smoking i 39 m sure it will be my new friend for life you could drink it with water but i wouldn 39 t  the best nip around can quite easily accidentally go through a whole bottle in one sitting  drops one star rating as i do prefer the less medicinal flavours of ardbeg and lagavulin but gets half back for value quite a bit cheaper than ardbeg 10 here in western canada but definately a must have or at least must try for those that enjoy peated scotch  it 39 s everything that everyone says it is it 39 s a flavour bomb slap in the face and it amazes me that it 39 s become ubiquitous and obtainable everywhere though i 39 m grateful too as it means i can always get some and reasonably priced too  being new to whisky and malts this has an amazing taste and after a long weeks work you need to relax and this is my first choice great taste great story just sit back with some filtered water and enjoy  first drank this stuff circa 1996 loved it it started my whisky love affair really then it was lagavulin bhunnahabin since then i have been lucky to start a fair collection myself i have drunk some rather special stuff this remains a favorite and there are some whisky snobs who are a bit snooty about the 10 i still love it i even like the fact that its bottled at 43percent means i can have 2 on a sunday night and function and if there is colour added its not exactly obvious always in my cupboard  beautiful peaty and smokey well balanced whiskey i bought this one today and i wasn 39 t sure i was buying the right product horst l wasn 39 t too impressed with it ralfy gave this 91 and 84 in his reviews though there are two reviews of this type on his channel laphroig state on the bottle that they are the most richly flavoured of all scotch whiskies i thought it was a bullshit but at the moment i am looking for maturity and less alcohol bite but i decided to give this one a chance to be honest it has probably the best 10 year old whisky you can get it is quite rich for a 10 yr old that tells us that they are good casks and they take care of each factor in their process but because it 39 s a 10 year old it 39 s less 39 smooth 39 than the matured ones but they were right it 39 s a good one and to be noticed the smoke is not covering everything i don 39 t know the excactly ppm number but it 39 s well balanced trust me i gotta give this 4 5 stars  nothing i 39 ve tried comes close fabulous distinct divine drink this late on a sunday evening and lapse into heavenliness this is beyond earthly tastes incredible  pound for pound probably one of the best whiskys you can buy not too expensive occasionally 163 28 on offer and unreal flavours hits all the notes for me sweet smokey peaty and woody astonishingly easy to drink  i find when my whisky bottle has a few glasses left i enjoy browsing the web and researching whisky 39 s and then end up buying yet another bottle of talisker 10 simply because i love it so much now my birthday has rolled around and i 39 ve been bought a talisker 10 so treated myself to a laphroaig 10 and sat down with them side by side i am literally in love with this laphroiag 10 it 39 s actually far more complex in its flavours than i expected and just so damn easy to drink my one criticism would be that i wouldn 39 t mind it being slightly stronger in strength it goes down far too easily and i can see this bottle being drained too quickly an absolutely gorgeous whisky if you enjoy peaty mouthfuls of campfire smoke and for me personally a wonderful almost vanilla undertone i will definitely be grabbing another one of these bottles possibly too soon  this is honestly one of my all time favorites the flavor profile is amazing and there isn 39 t anything else quite like it out there i have had many islay whiskys and i don 39 t really directly notice the smoke anymore i think it 39 s sort of like acquiring a taste for spicy food that being said these one star comments saying it tastes like disinfectant tar or just overall foul are disingenuous to the product it 39 s like when little kids don 39 t appreciate good food until their older  this iconic dram embodies the character and complexity of the islay spirit bold peat and smoky wafts give way to sweet citrus and oaky flavours with each sip add water to release the nectar of the gods a true experience but the weak kneed need not apply  god i bloody love laphroaig this 10 year old is almost perfect it s got all the medicinal smokiness going on plus the most deliciously sweet spirit lurking beneath  i will not buying it again good evening i am a retired u s navy chief petty office so i purchase my laphroaig at the parris island s c exchange truly your scotch whiskey is a pleasure to enjoy anytime after a meal or relaxing by the fireplace i hope someday to visit your exceptional distillery and meet all the talented masters of laphoaig semper fidelis campbell c cauthen iii laphroaig 10year smokey peaty vanilla brine salt notes seaside fruity floral note all on the nose at first the smoke and mossy notes hit you but then this fruity floral note opens up after you get used to the peat palate seaweed brine smoke little spice tastes like disinfectant got a bottle of this for xmas on opening could tell straight away that it has changed and in my opinion not for the better decanted and left for a few weeks it has opened up a little and it is still a good whisky however nowhere near a good as used to be advantage ardbeg  this was my go to smokey whisky for a couple of years the last two bottles are not nearly as good as previous bottles it is still ok but there just seems to be less smoke iodine and sugar sweetness dominate the palate it 39 s a shame  if you want a hearty peaty smokey taste then look no further a joy to drink a great one to remember and a go to for dram for toasting absent friends delicious to the last drop when we meet again i hope you have one waiting for me  not been a big whisky fan after getting drunk and ill on some canadian rubbish years ago anyway i 39 ve always liked smokey flavours and seeing the tv adverts for laph recently made me give it a go and i love it the smokey medicinal taste is a nice combination and it is is lovely and warming going down will be my springboard for trying other islay malts  sweet amp peat everyday drink  absolutely awful first the nose i immediately thought of tcp then the taste definitely tcpawful dreadful tast you ll love it or hate it very smoky iodine oak spice peat and tea with a long finish must be taken with water or ice is acceptable as it open up after a while very reminiscent of lapsang souchong tea so if you like that you ll surely love this one of the few scotches i ll drink i prefer irish though this is an exceptional drop  awful it is a nicely flavoured smokey briney peaty islay scotch however is lacking the punch you get with quarter cask or ardbeg 10 my guess is because it is only bottled at 40 vs qc which is 48 and ardbeg 10 which is 46 the lower abv makes a huge difference imo and whilst this is still good it is not as good as others from the island  the marmite of the whisky world hate it or love it my dad loved it l like a good malt but when the peaty taste comes back on you for two days after it it becomes less than enjoyable this one is not for me  i bought my bottle when it was on offer and really enjoyed it it has unavoidable smoky nose and taste in it with a quite well balanced flavor and sweetness i won 39 t hesitate to try it again  this is a classic islay scotch great smoky peat moss and a great value this is not an inexperienced scotch drinker or a fan of sweet whiskeys though  if you are looking for an absolute iodine packed peat bomb laphroaig 10 is your dram not for the faint of heart or someone that is new to islay scotch  i would say that above john campbells tasting notes are in line with mine a bit of water is a must with laphroaig 10 without water this is earns many of those negative comments below but for example teaspoon of water in a 4 5 cl changes this completely and give it a small rest in a glass that 180 s something i would recommend with every decent islay whisky try it and i m sure you will notice the difference with the correct amount of water laphroaig 10 will beat easily for example ardbeg 10 water brings out the complexity and richness of this islay legend  guessing this is a marmite type deal or maybe i 39 m just a newbie pure tcp in terms of smell and taste to me i couldn 39 t stomach it at all had to wash my beard to remove the lingering aroma  i drank this before 2 yrs ago and had a very good opinion on it just bought a bottle and it is disappointing to say the least what smoke there isn 39 t any what taste a little sweet more like water i 39 d stick to ardbeg thank you i m working on trying to appreciate islay scotches nose is big iodine campfire smoke peat woody cinnamon palate is sweet on the tongue with a massive chemical blast of blackened plastic and burnt weeds more iodine pepper and chili somewhat i could sorta see cardamom trying to be found beneath the burnt biomatter finish is dry which is cool and leans more towards pepper and tar  this was my second bottle of whisky i ever bought and tasted after reading reviews i expected something 39 too heavy 39 something i would have to learn to drink after opening the bottle and smelling and tasting it i can say i 39 m a instant fan i don 39 t find it harsh at all just intens in a good way campfire and iodine rich taste  never more take the cheapest whisky from tesco bottom shelf lick the road surface bite the old tyre chew and flush it down with that whisky this is the same flavour and note laphroaig used to be a very solid tasty experience some 10 years ago but recently give or take 5 years i 39 d guess as some of the older bottles i got my hands on were still pretty good they started producing subpar artificially colored filtered drink i refuse to call this a scotch which has nothing in common with what it used to be taste is sweet with a strong alcoholic body only slightly peaty almost no smokiness smell is mostly alcohol with a hint of peat and very light smoke it is utterly bland and boring mostly reminiscent of cheaper low quality drams  smoky and smooth a superb islay production  laphraoig is certainly not for the weak kneed boasting a complexity of smoke citrus sweetness and brine it caters to those who prefer islay offerings 6 stars out of 5 i can 39 t believe how much this whiskey has changed recently i have been drinking it frequently for more than 20 years my friends and i agree that the change has not been for the better it used to be so smoky it was almost challenging to drink now it is pale lifeless and sweet beyond belief we shall be looking elsewhere for a drop of party smoky whiskey  a bastion of smoky sweet intensity on the nose and palate no wonder laphraoig has been around since 1815 good whisky for a good long time  delicious in a subtle way and not overly peaty or spicy yet still warming  the first sip of laphroaig 10 and i felt like someone that thought metal was all about poison and motley crue all of his puny little sissy life listen now folks this is the dillinger escape plan of the whisky musical realm requires concentration definitely not an easy listening but brutal complex and utterly rewarding material buy crack it open and behold  like being by a campfire delicious  this is wierd but in a good way the nose and the taste is powerful i get a huge smoke smell and taste at the same time beside smokiness i taste massive burnt tire and medicine flavours and they last forever on my tongue but it is not hard to drink at the same time really strange but beautiful whisky  this is like drinking liquid charcoal in a good way if you 39 re into that nose heavy smoke log cabins woods taste slightly one dimensional it 39 s all smoke but with a finish that is incredibly clean if you ever wondered what a freshly disinfected hospital floor would taste like after a major fire in the building then this is your dram nothing else comes close  after making my way through the islay distilleries i acquired a taste for iodine peat and smoke that such whiskys as talisker only suggested and finally made my way over to a laphroaig 10 after many recommendations this is what islay scotch is all about seaweed on a beach bonfire on a stormy winter night well balanced by fruit lemon peach a hint of honey and loads of spice cardamon cloves star anise and a bit of cassia all washed down with a delicious medicine certainly an acquired taste all nuanced taste is acquired anyway so you shouldn 39 t start your whisky journey with it but you may well end it with it  great price good dram to have neat give it a try  the first whisky i ever tried and it put me off whisky for nearly ten years which is probably a good thing as now i have a far more experienced palate and can enjoy life 39 s greatest gift whisky revisiting it at a more mature 29 instead of a head strong 19 year old one certainly appreciates l10 and its intensity a few drops of water in the dram make this a far more enjoyable experience than drinking beat the flavours become a lot clearer and fun it compliments cheese and guinness very well in fact going from sips of guinness to sips of laphroaig 10 brings a whole new level of taste to both drinks it 39 s not for sissies and the weak this will put hairs on your chest and grow you a beard of steel those who can 39 t handle it will probably be best suited to a bottle of wkd or hooch a nice all round dram but a touch too sweet for my taste and not enough peat  this the whiskey that made me a single malt drinker before this i tried different mellow malts that everyone recommends for the newbies and couldn t understand why should i pay as much as twice for a bottle of whiskey that is only marginally better than the blends i used to drink now i can recognize the quality of good speyside or highland but it was laphroig 10 that opened the door for me it was magical rough and biting but also complex full with flavours and well balanced dram over the years i believe it mellowed down it s peetinness but it kept same qualities that i fell in love with  the 10 is far mellower than the quarter cask or three wood which are both awesome that 39 s why its the flagship expression the select is also great just less intense than the 10 so smooth everything is perfect on this whisky its smoky fruity medicinal salty and long and smooth sublime balance just needs to be 43 48 laphroaig is so goodthe lp 10 is a top 10 whisky i have been drinking single malt for a while now and never liked laphroaig having recently started to appreciate and enjoy bruichladdich et al i decided to buy a bottle today it is ok nothing more it feels like the heart has been ripped out of it there is no middle the aftertaste is muted and the peat is tasteful i far prefer scottish barley to this and i am 95 certain a thirty year old bottle in pristine condition would not taste so bland  excellent whisky great finish and flavours  deep down beneath the powerful smokey iodine nose lies a layer of strawberry bonbons and a touch of vanilla rich and fiery on the palate with more liquorice vanilla and treacle below the surface a fine and persistent spicy finish with sea blown smoke a super dram with great structure  i love this 10 and also the select great way to seal the day  my first laphroaig 10 and the nose blew me away and the taste was even better  my favourite islay whisky beyond the smokiness this beauty has rich and endless flavours  love it or hate it this islay single malt is divisive strong medicinal on the nose and will surely repulse a newbie i thought it was outrageous the first time i drank it but it has grown on me over the years this is better than the quarter cask which i think is a bit too young and confronting the 1o yo is the mellower of the 2 in my opinion i have an unopened triple cask px which i look forward to opening sipping a laphroaig makes drinking whisky a bit less boring  after meals chatting boom i have tried a lot of malts but 10 year is by far the best of any other malts  i bought this for my dad for christmas i wasn 39 t even aware of peated whiskey and was put off when we opened it for a smell on christmas day morning later on that night i had a glass with a splash of ginger ale now i owe my dad a new bottle over the space of a few weeks i polished off the lot and my dad didn 39 t even have a single glass sorry not sorry i actively look for this when i 39 m out in a bar now  the laphroaig 10 year old made me fall in love with peated whisky it took some getting used to a first but after a few sips it quickly became an absolute favorite  i 39 m far from a whiskey expert but yikes bought this stuff yesterday my wife amp i could barely get it down the aroma is that of an expired bathroom cleanser and the taste is just a hard 39 no 39 y this whisky is not for the light and fruity type lover the tasting notes here are dead on and adding a little water or a rock opens this delicious dram right up not as good as the 10 cask strength but a classic staple of islay nonetheless if you like peat smoke salty licorice iodine flavors and a long richly sweet amp dry oaky finish this one s for you  very disappointed was really looking forward to this but i couldn t drink it i d expected an iodine influence possibly because of the islay peat but this smells like a first aid box and tastes of tcp strange  probably because it tastes like tcp  i 39 m still a whisky newbie and quickly strayed down the peaty route thanks to talisker after researching the main peaty numbers it quickly became apparent this is one of those i needed to try i never forget my first nose and sip of it it absolutely knocked my socks off and wasn 39 t for the fainted hearted the whisky version of marmite but as a marmite lover i totally love this stuff smells like a farm yard and tastes like a farm mixed with seaweed earthly salty and just wonderful of all the malts i have so far this is the one that challenges my developing whisky palate the most and i 39 m grateful for it when i 39 m in the mood and want to be smacked in the face with big whisky flavour this is what i reach for not an everyday dram but for me but a staple none the less still working on understanding this one out but i will get there  in my mid twenties i first tried this and chokingly thought it tasted like a wet ashtray of course back then i drank corona with a lime and thought it was good fast forward twenty years and the peat smoke brine and kelp and the roasted caramel and peppery notes and the long lasting savoriness hits the mark every time it 39 s all i want it a scotch single malt  for the price this bottling is the ticket deliciously balanced with smoke salt and sweetness epic brilliant and a main staple at my bar for nay sayers i want to say thanks more for me  sure this is not for everyone but for those who like the smoke and peat this is a delightful dram savory sweet and smoky with a touch of brine memories of distant sea shore fires with friends and whisky truly an iconic offering from south islay  not my first laphroaig product but the second i have ever had i first had the quarter cask which i adored after trying to 10 still getting the smoky meaty sweetness and briny salty flavors my first islay scotches and i love it  if you love peat whiskey then you should get a bottle light an open fire and get cosy heaven  you should think about preventing certain users of your site from leaving comments when they know nothing about it  awful smell of tcp  i wasn 39 t a massive fan of peated whisky until i tasted this i would recommend as a good starter if you are just finding your way into peated whisky  i like my smokey peated whiskies i 39 m a fan of lagavulin arbeg in small doses and other whiskies that aren 39 t as intense such as talisker this whiskey is a different creature than the others listed the smell was good but as soon as i tasted it i knew i made a mistake i got rubber bands and band aids and kind of a weird flat taste that i couldn 39 t shake i don 39 t know how they created the taste they did it certainly didn 39 t taste like any grains were used in the mash to me but my body told me its probably something i shouldn 39 t be ingesting  like sitting a little too close to a campfire followed by thick and delicious honey sweet whiskey a good value under 40 in virginia this bottle is close to 50  before you spend your hard earned money on laphroaig go to your local pharmacy and buy a small bottle of anbesol for 5 bucks you know the stuff your mother used to rub on your gums for a toothache take a good sip of that stuff and if you like it then you 39 ll love laphroaig whiskey  i 39 ve tried quite a few whiskys over the past 50 years and the 10 year old laphroaig is the one i always return to nothing else is anywhere near as interesting  laphroaig have really produced some rubbish over the last decade the entry level 10 is one of the worst in their line up and gets worse year on year it s unrefined uninteresting watered down so much that a mcdonald s milkshake has more of a kick than this garbage what makes this so frustrating is that laphroaig can actually produce some outstanding whisky the quarter cask towers over the 10 the 18 is sublime and the recent release of the 16 bottled at 48 is arguably the best new scotch of 2019 so i urge everyone to avoid this basic uncultured offering and buy the quarter cask for less or buy the amazing 16  i 39 m not entirely convinced that they don 39 t just squeeze the juices out of bog mummies and bottle it it smells and tastes like it was aged 10 years in a corpse embalmed in rubbing alcohol  i haven 39 t had a laphroaig 10 for years but i always called it my favourite whisky i bought a bottle recently and the first glass had me scratching my head the medicinal flavour was overwhelming and the smoke was muted but i came back to it a few days later and the balance was back wonderful smoke and spices came to the fore and my love was rekindled if you gave up after the 1st glass give it another shot the 1 4 cask is slightly more to my taste at the moment but i could well change my mind in another glass or two  it tastes like sheep dip i love it  you should give it a try the only thing i can say about this magnificent whiskey is to maximize the flavor you can add it with a few drops of water then you reach the song of the smoke on the water from deep purple comparing the price it is definitely worth it  i always called this quot my favourite quot because i enjoyed the strong tar scent and the same taste on my tongue where has it gone i don 39 t like the watery taste i now get might as well move across to bowmore for a hint of the taste iwas used to  somewhere way back i commented but i can 39 t find my own comment that the iodine some say tcp taste was a falt how stupid i was this is a great whisky for the price and at any price i really love it 39 s smokey peaty iodiny flavours powerful nose rich creamy mouth feel is it getting to sweet with time i wonder  this is an amazing and iconic dram laphraoig 10 brings out the best of islay malts with its intense and bold flavours spice brine ash phenols seaside flora and sweet citrus notes are preset in the nose and palette a complex and savory beast not recommended for those who are unfamiliar with islay single malt scotch not recommended for the weak kneed cheers  utterly horrid recieved a bottle as a gift had it in my liquor cabinet for over 5 years opened it and the cork fell apart in pieces thankfully didn 39 t get in the bottle after i poured it in a glass it smelled like melted plastic what an incredible let down let it sit for over an hour and it still tasted awful i guess if you enjoy medicated mouthwash this is for you either that or your taste buds were obliterated prior thankfully this bottle was a gift and i didn 39 t waste my own money on it  i took baby steps with scotch trying the chivas regal as my first venture this laphroig 10 year is something else entirely in a very good way all band aids and menthol cigarettes from the nose to the back of the throat to many moments later still lingering on the tongue massively complex if you can stomach the initial taste and aroma bonfire on the beach is a good visual with this they 39 ve been making this for a very long time and it shows wicked stuff  it is thin tasting smelling and much like jwr is like drinking denatured alcohol blended with e15 i cant believed i paid 50 bucks for a fifth oh and heavy hangover quotient  imagine leaving a load of dettol in a barrel for a few years and this is what you end up with smells and tastes like antiseptic spray have been a lover of whiskey for many years and treat myself to the odd dram once in a while wish i hadn 39 t this time straight down the drain  the islay sea and sky come together in this refined complex gem peat smoke and sweetness meld together in this delicious and balanced whisky my bar never goes without  hilarious to see the hugely negative reviews mainly from those who spell whisky as whiskey firstly this whisky needs time to fully appreciate it secondly it remains one of the cornerstones of scotch whisky i love a sherried speyside or a dry spicy highland as much as anyone but when you need that peaty iodine hit laphroaig will always be there for you if it s not for you that s fine but that doesn t diminish its ongoing impact and influence for those of us that appreciate it  hadn 39 t tried this for a number of years and barely recognised it the quot oak and smoke quot thing is new and has almost erased the tcp seaweed ness that used to be the core of laphroaig i reckon all the malt 39 s coming from port ellen and not from the original beds and that 39 s true of most of the islay malts now and the individual distillery flavours are converging or getting smothered even uigie is now immune grr kilchoman doesn 39 t use port ellen maltings and it shows rant over i first tried it a decade ago in a pub at a friend 39 s recommendation it was way too much for me then couldn 39 t finish it i tried it again a few years ago and a sniff suddenly evoked old memories a holiday in the outer hebrides a steam railway museum playing in forests bonfires and er tcp for a sore throat fast forward to now and i think it 39 s wonderful i 39 d very gladly have a glass of the stuff but my wife can 39 t stand it d the taste is awful it 39 s like it was made in a burnt plastic barrel this is to whisky what charcoal is to doughnut i bet that even the cheapest whisky in the shop would taste better never again  a big briny peaty punch in the nose seems to be sweeter lately but still wonderful the more you drink the more complex it gets  a somewhat unique taste even for an islay balanced between the cymbal crashes of peat smoke and iodine for some of us these odd flavors are treasures others not so much once past the smoke etc one finds nice sweet notes a very nice cleansing change from the often cloying sweetness of bourbons or some speysides a classic islay imo also a good starting point to go exploring some of the more unique island scotches they still malt and age their own barley and that speaks volumes if you are on a whiskey journey this is a must  telephone poles and railroad ties the wet ashes of last nights campfire with a lasting finish of embalming fluid but i love it  i find that the enjoyment i derive from a scotch is inversely proportionate to my wife s opinion of its aroma she thinks the laphroaig 10 smells like someone s set fire to an old leather shoe by the seaside clearly i think it s fabulous good value too don t buy the nas select spend a few more pounds on this it really does smell like a burning shoe i sat in a bar in inverness last year and ordered a laphroaig 10 the nice scottish lady said are you sure you want it this is the worst whiskey in the world i wouldnt drink it i ordered it drank the dram but in a busy bar i didnt get the taste i bought it back home and ultimately during my first tasting understood where the lady was coming from the iodine is strong and the peat heavy but you can smell the sea the scottish weather there is emotion in the smell then big surprise the taste smooth almost sweet subtle the contrast between smell and taste is incredible and overall laphroaig embodies what a peated whiskey should be smoke you actually enjoy you need to get used to the iodine first though  es mi primer whisky islay realmente diferente a todos los dem 225 s pero muy agradable  the first time i tried laphroaig or any islay was as a sampler in a vintages shop i bought a bottle and took it home but when i tasted a full dram i was so sure i had wasted my money as i was a young student at the time 40 yrs ago i couldn 39 t afford to waste it and was faced with finishing it a glass every few days or so before i could buy my next bottle of speyside or highland the first glass or two were tough but after a while i gained an appreciation for it by the time i had finished the bottle i knew i 39 d found my favourite and now i only drink islay malts have patience and you 39 ll be rewarded  the trick to laphroaig is to give it a chance the first time is definitely an attack on the senses tcp etc but keep trying it is now my go to tipple it has a great complexity of tastes and none of them that original tcp theme the smell you first experience also completely changes just give it a chance  smells and tastes like tcp i d read it had an aroma of hospital but good god  it came highly recommended from a friend in northern ireland first whiff fits with many comments hospital but after some more teasing sniffs i found some smokey peat aroma first taste was confusing first mediciney with the after taste of earth taking it slow i can start to sense the caskes smokey and peat flavor as it slips easily down i am enjoying  smooth finish and not completely unpleasant but it tastes like band aids with a bit of the sea wanted to like it and i like most single malts really but the band aid flavor is too overwhelming i have bought so many bottles of this over the years but these days it is not the same drink the smoke has been toned down maybe the bottles are varied for some reason i once got a bottle that was obviously a cheap blended whisky and not laphroig but that was years ago now most bottles are a weaker tasting drink however the whole room used to smell of peat if you poured a laphroig laphroig what have you done  i really love this whisky i would call it a black coffee drinker 39 s whisky not because you must be a psychopath to like it as a recent psychology study seemed to indicate but because you need to truly enjoy bitterness in order to enjoy laphroaig i 39 m not an expert in tasting elements or chemicals but i can tell that the bitterness is really well balanced by sweetness and the smokiness complements both well it has a nice oily quality on the mouth that helps the flavor and odor linger and develop drink it with a splash of filtered water to help it open up don 39 t add ice unless you want the flavors muted there are some really nice expressions of ultra smooth wonderful speyside whiskies that may be more pleasant to drink but i really dig the experience of this scotch it makes you feel something it 39 s delicious but it 39 s also thrilling if that makes sense  few years ago i had my first ever bottle and right after i opened it i thought i couldn t drink it was so smoky but then i was amazed and really appreciate this awesome scotch recently i bought 10 again opened it and been kind of disappointed all this strong smell and the feeling of hospital wasn t there i bought another bottle and again it wasn t smelly like i remember it the taste was same but where is the pit fire smell just wandering did they change the technology i don t want to think that the retailer sells fake whiskey because they are in the business for 20 years after i finish and the second bottle i will buy it from another place and if it s same i guess it ll be my last laphroaig 10 i ll give 3 stars despite the amazing taste  my wife almost collapsed when i pushed a dram of this under her nose and sure anyone who hates hospitals should avoid but once the surprise of the first sniff and taste recedes then the 39 medicine 39 does you nothing but good a shame you can 39 t get it on the nhs i 39 m not experienced enough to be able to compare it with too many other malts but all i know is laphroig is special  this tastes like a dentist office dumpster caught fire if you like that awesome definitely not for me though  you can smell the smokiness of it from across the room it has a massive kick to it enough to knock you over if you don 39 t know what 39 s coming but it 39 s very nice once you work your way into it  this whisky is like marmite you either love the stuff with passion or you can 39 t stand it for me i love it it 39 s smokey smooth and warming if you hate it it smells like tcp it 39 s weird i took a bottle to a party and the whisky drinkers there loved it everyone else literally turned thier noses up no one converts to liking this stuff this is the o my bottle of whisky i 39 ve sat and drank the rest i really don 39 t like i just can 39 t put my finger on why i love this bottle  there is nothing like laphroaig and their 10 is the core though mine have all been 43 bottlings for those who love laphroaig no other whisky will elicit as much comfort to me laphroaig is the warm embrace of campfire smoke kelp air taste and toffee sweetness the 10 yo has it all there in spades  this was my first tasting of 2018 and concerned that the quintessential attack and distinction may have been toned down a little still amazing just hope my fears are not founded will require further tastings and possibly another bottle to rule out bottle variation  my first laphroaig and i like it i find it actually quiet easy to drink it has this quot special quot peaty laph taste i guess but also smooth and creamy a bit like the ardbeg 10 yo really good islay whisky  this and ardbeg 10 are the best my kinda whisky coz i love the peaties  tcp but classy tcp  unique bold complex yet an easyand comforting sipper love it now or come back later on this on is so special peat ocean seaweeds fist aid bandage iodine never boring this and ardbeg 10 are my favorite malt duo a  it has got to be the worst tasting scotch in the world talk about notes of medicine this thing is more like diesel fuel than anything i would totally recommend it to a friend just to see their reaction 10 stars i ve had this a few times but this is the first bottle i bought on the nose was smoke and iodine the palate proved peaty goodness oak cask brine and grilled beef after adding a few drops of water i got caramel and cream iodine was still strong the finish was just peeeeeeeeeeat very islay  put yourself on the rugged coast of islay roasting old bagpipe bladders over a fire of loch fyne kipper boxes there 39 s no soft shoeing it this is one of the best of scottish single malt whiskies if you can take it it 39 s not for the faint of heart it grabs you by the throat in the nicest possible way looks you in the eye and says quot cairdeas quot once you have sipped a dram you 39 ll never forget it  like it says on the bottle they devide opinion this is either a love or hate dram imagine being hit in the face by a cloud of smoke wielding a medicine box full of brine and seaweed it s amazing  quite simply superb lovely taste lovely lingering after taste the best  was really disappointed on the nose if compared to lagavulin 12 16 ardbeg 10 uguidal leidag 10 bad bottle maybe the nose was really shy i had trouble to to really find the big peat medicinal aromas on the palate quite smokey at the end too had the impression that i was eating straight pepper at the end not a good experience with that bottle  this dram has divided opinions in forever either you love it or you hate it it 39 s complexity and delicious combination of peat and smoke with citrus notes makes this one of my favorites i would not present this to a novice scotch drinker but rather give them a less complex less medicinal less savory islay gem and pour them a sweet cherry bomb i 39 ll have this  a classic malt beyond criticism however i prefer ardbeg 10 year old which is similar but subtly different  being a lover of scotch i 39 m happy to have tried it but the chemical taste is something i would expect from a cheap whiskey made last week not a 10 yr scotch water did offer a little reprieve but not enough to drink again  so i guess i forgot to leave my signature on my review of this when i first tried it a few years ago so better do a re review for good measure i am drunk and bored anyways this is seriously one of the most classic and easily available and affordable islay 39 s out there and it rarely dissapoints one thing i really love about laphroaig is that funky iodine band aid medicine flavor its so unique and it really has this nostalgia effect that makes me think of my grandparents and in a weird way makes me feel like an old man on the nose peat for sure with some vanilla and seaweed flavor is burning band aids in a bowl of home made vanilla ice cream with a little too much salt while cool wood smoke weaves it 39 s way throughout sounds weird to some maybe but for those of us who enjoy laphroaig it is mouth watering when i first tried this i gave it a 9 i have bought many bottles of this over the last few years and i would say 85 of the time it is wonderful but i have had a handful of bad or off bottles that have made me rethink that score also there is clearly quite a bit of caramel color in this so a little inconsistent and fake color but other than that totally awesome you 39 ll have a hard time finding something better for 40 the sugarbear possibly the signature islay taste major peat smoke and seaspray hit you right of the bat the iodine and medicinal taste won 39 t suit everyone 39 s taste you will either love it or despise it if i close my eyes i 39 m transported to a cold scottish beach at night with the ashes of a bonfire lingering in the night air  the summary says it all absolutely amazing for someone who enjoys heavy peated whisky seasalt seaweed even sort of chemical notes just wonderful but definitely not for everyone 39 s taste  the most unusual taste i 39 ve ever encounter in a distilled spirit i have extensive experience with spirits including scotch 39 s and irish whiskeys this one laphroaig 10 is the hardest to warm up i have 39 ever 39 consumed purchased it as a result of seeing a documentary on the isle of islay wow i can 39 t help but think that 39 perhaps 39 i received a bad batch yet if not and i 39 m sure the taste is treasured by many world wide it is just not for me i don 39 t want to disparage the product just say it has a most unusual taste  a unique taste smells like the smoke from a bonfire recently cut and rolled turf after the rain with a whiff of the natural bark of a liquorice stick when first broken in two tastes of a mixture of aniseed balls and black pepper and the saltiness of samphire  this is the peaty malt of peaty malts you may hate this on first taste but you will love it on your second taste after that nothing compares  definitely smokey but mild totally different to many single malts think you will love it or loathe it my first experience with scotch totally funky band aid box and peat aromas and tastes that are even harder to describe but wait the magic begins and you realize the well is much deeper than you previously thought full of complexities and surprises this one but beware laphroaig is not for the clandestine drinker because the aromas that emanate when you let the genie out of this bottle everyone in the room will know you have  ordered this at a local bar thought to myself i like a bit of peaated smoke it was served to me and the nose was complex and rich smoky yes but promising and then i took my sip i hated it many people associate with medicine and i could see that the smoke was overpowering and downright cruel after a few minutes i took a sip a few minutes later i took another as i got used to the whisky the whisky got used to me my lesson would be you can 39 t just jump on this whisky you have to let it creep up on you treat it with respect give it time to open up don 39 t expect it to be anything it 39 s not i kept coming back to it over and over and by the time i was done it was like an old friend i could taste it walking down the road home 20 minutes later even the finish seems to change becoming richer that lingering smoke almost chewy this is a fantastic whisky for it 39 s price it should be tried by everyone loved by few hated by some but never leaving anyone undecided just give it a second third and fourth chance and who knows it may change your mind a poor man 39 s lagavulin 16 this makes a fine addition to any collection you may find yourself coming back to it even when you 39 re not sure why  in a world where the bland the mundane and the dreary everyday is celebrated where ed sheeran is a musical giant laphroaig stands like rage against the machine f k you i won t do what you tell me it s cussed it s challenging it tastes like nothing else you ve ever tasted and if you get it you ll stick with it for life i fully understand why some people hate it because it does evoke strong reactions but for me it s the best standard edition single malt in the world  mycket r 246 k o lite l 228 dersmak upplevs 228 nd 229 ganska mild i munnen jag 228 lskar den  once one acquires the taste and appreciate the slam in the face experience this little gem joins the list of one s top 10 a great malt on a cold windy winter s night in front of a roaring fire  if i was a bigger islay man i would rate it a 5 the smokiness is delightful almost carries a burnt rubber aroma  so f ing rich and delicious i get shivers thinking about sipping a dram paired with a chunk of strong cheese juicy fruits and smoky peat like a dream come true my favorite  i did not get on with this when i tried it as a much younger man i wanted to like smokey peaty whisky so recently gave it another go now i get it it has become my number 1 tipple  my go to scotch at home bars and restaurants yes it is very different from your varieties of sherried scotch brands and it certainly is a matter of apprciation and taste it has a delicious sea salt note melded with honey and dried fruits with characteristic quot ashy wood thrown in the fire pit quot note in the back give me a nice cubano and a glass of laphraoig and my heaven awaits  surprise attack of the peat monster oily richness of smokey and spicy notes with citrus and sweet finish all i can say is i ordered this for the first time at a local pub and thought the bartender was trying to kill me iodine poisoning i thought i survived and went to heaven a delicious introduction to peaty scotch hard to go back to lighter offereings now  shared with a group of friends that night was by far the most memorable experience out of my entire trip in san francisco the flavors in this bottle had a rich leathery smell to it with a warm and gentle burn as it went down our throats the warmth persisted as it entered our stomachs and eventually our whole bodies we had an incredible time that night all thanks to our new and genuine scottish friend laphroaig  the islay dram that is not for the weak kneed full slam peat blast with smokey and phenolic overtones that clears the nostrils brine and fruity notes gives this malt a sweet and savory acclimation truly a favorite of many and despised by those who do not stray far from the speyside offerings for the discerning and adventurous scotch drinker i drink with the vikings  first time i tasted it i thought they 39 d dragged a wino out of a house fire and filtered kerosene through his socks my opinion has obviously changed if i have only one scotch it 39 s laphroaig 10  not for first time whisky drinkers it 39 s definitely an acquired taste having said that spend some time with it and i believe you will begin to appreciate it although bottled at 40 i think it 39 s the best 39 bang for buck 39 whisky available  tried it and went out the next day and bought 6 bottles nuff said  big brash flavour that hits you and lingers this is marmite you either hate it or love it and i absolutely love it heavy smoke iodine a balanced brine and spices that get sweeter as you drink it is awesome  far too chemically for me people mentioning iodine as if its a good thing nope nope nope  some people say water to open out the palate but it is as smooth as on the finish amp i think it can be enjoyed either way maybe water in the 1st 1 or 2 of a session to get your taste buds accustomed then no need after that a great islay if you love iodine tcp bbq notes this is for u if not stay away try glenmorangie or something p s tesco do this for 163 35 as of 7 7 17 amp regularly have offers on that make the price even lower  wow it 39 s like being in a cloud of a big fire camp smoke and suddenly breathe some antiseptic liquid vapors the sea salt seaweed awesome medicinal flavors i 39 m loving it i will always have a laphroaig 10 on my shelf  big bold flavours a must try if you like big peat opens up nicely with a splash of water  qui si tocca l 39 apice del gusto marino iodato fumoso al massimo dello splendore di un sapore forte ma allo stesso tempo lievemente morbido un whisky tra i primi in assoluto come altri di islay la liquirizia arriva al palato abbastanza pungente come le spezie whisky giusto per una serata giusta  i 39 m not really sure why somebody would want to drink this i 39 ve read some reviews saying it has a quot hint of smoke quot lol it tastes like medical disinfectant that lasted through a house fire if you want to know what it tastes like save some money by pouring some iodine on a burnt log and licking it  take a good whiskey then find a coal power station and sit in the chimney while sipping it that 39 s laphroaig to me  on my 48th birthday i decided it was time to give scotch a try i found i did not like much the two highlands i bought the 10 year glengoyne and the 12 year aberfeldy i found the basic 12 year glenlivet speyside to be serviceable but my eyes didn 39 t light up with surprise and pleasure until i sampled a flight of islays my easy favorite was the 10 year laphroaig i bought a bottle and tried it out the next day with a fresh palate and a few drops of distilled water it was much more robust on its own the fire lingers on the lips the char on the tongue as i write this now i 39 m on my second and final dram of the night laphroiag is now my go to scotch and what i hope to drink on many more birthdays to come  the peat bomber 39 s standard bearer i find myself wishing this was bottled at 43 46 abv but i 39 ve probably gotten too spoiled on the quarter cask this whisky and indeed most offerings from laphroaig will polarize whisky drinkers but if you like peat and you like smoky whiskies this is a bottle that deserves to be in your collection  great starting point for anyone wanting to get into peaty whisky if you like this you can branch out to other distilleries  my two favorites are the macallan 25 i was gifted a bottle it 39 s running about 1900 a bottle now and the laphroaig 10 that 39 s how much i think of laphroaig drink it outside on a cold night and you will swear that you have been transported to islay with a salty breeze wafting in from the ocean and the smell of a cottage fire nearby it does generate mixed reactions from those who believe that scotch should only be a floral speyside i could just sit with a dram and sample the nose for an hour watch john campbell 39 s video on the laphroaig distillation process  at first your hit with a sensory overload the peaty medicinal nose oaky seaweedy flavours hit the tongue then the iodine hits also works well with water or an ice cube which i normally avoid but the flavours are so big on this one some nights it needs tamed  a scotch virgin no more i was given a bottle of this scotch by a friend whom i helped with a home project i took it home and put it in the liquor cabinet when my hometown team won their first championship i brought it out uncorked the bottle and drank a toast honoring my late fathers wish to live to see a trophy he did in an urn i sat next to the tele the first glass was a shock to my entire being the aroma the taste on my tongue the warm glow flowing through my body i wasn 39 t sure if i liked it or not tonight i toasted the purchase of my retirement house i basked in the smokey medicinal warmth that enveloped my soul laphroaig 1st dram a bit of shock on the nose and palate after some beautifuly smooth single malts i 39 ll need to keep working on it but i 39 m not optimistic at this minute i 39 m thinking if giving it away its more like medicine than malt  too peaty for my blood  one of my favorites  my grandmother 39 s favourite i love this stuff so full of flavour if you like peaty there 39 s nothing more peaty than this oddly it pairs well with cheese and onion crisps  love it of hate it there is no inbetween i love it but you do need to give it a chance if it 39 s your first time sipping it give it half a bottle and you 39 ll see what the fuss is about the quintessential islay single malt no other whisky showcases the classic islay style like this one stunningly good  this is something you drink when you 39 re sitting on the porch reading the odyssey in the middle of winter if you can see boats from your porch that 39 s even better definitely not a tuesday night reality tv show sort of drink  latrine cake nose recenty extinguished house fire taste germoline finish i don 39 t want acquire that taste  the softest smokiest peaty smooth drink in scotland once tasted never forgotten nothing else comes close deep and rounded just wonderful  love this scotch this is a great dram for a cold winters night smokey and peaty right from the pour to your mouth it has nice depth and great flavor my favorite islay is lagavulin 16 but this is up there and half the price you can appreciate the distinct wood smoke taste it brings with every sip this is a quot scotch quot  savory and rich with smoky umami aroma that makes your mouth water nicely rounded out by notes of dried peaches and pears the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the smoke and salt absolutely delicious and one of my all time favorites i always keep this on hand  an acquired taste it took me a while to get used to it but now i love it i agree at first opening for the first time it did smell of petrol but once i got over that i realised i had found a great whisky  almost perfectly balanced single malt from islay laphroaig have nailed it with their signature 10 year old all these bimbos on here that are saying it tastes like a medicine cabinet tastes like petrol tastes like band aids soaked in peroxide you morons should not post reviews for the simple reason you 39 re all inexperienced and have under developed palates and you don 39 t know anything about the varying styles of whisky all in all you just come across as uneducated idiots do some homework develop your palates and then post reviews us experienced drinkers who know the magic islay holds we simply sit here and laugh at your negative reviews because we can tell straight away you 39 s are just uneducated and have childrens palates really not nice and taste like tcp even with a mixer which i never normally do there is no hiding the taste definitely an acquired taste not used to islay malts smell of burned rubber smokey seaweed strong smell of band aid hard to drink but leaves you statisfied  from the first whiff i was taken aback by the strong sents anyway others have very detailed descriptions amp i don 39 t need to elaborate but one weird thing is even though i didn 39 t like it amp had trouble finishing the first dram after waiting 15 or 20 minutes i want to go in for another  i love the medicinal quality of laphroaig for the money this is a 5 star whisky  even a jack daniel 39 s has a more vibrant character than this i am sure there are people who appreciate this but for me this is like just pure liquid smoke it 39 s as if they added the burnt peat ash into the copper stills  it 39 s incredible for the price a lot of flavours and a good hint of smoke  you either love it or you hate it in my case i love laphroaig it 39 s my go to i remember the first time i had it well it was a cold autumn night on baker street and i was wanting the warmth of a nice quiet pub decided to take a walk down a side street and found a little place called the barley mow stepped in got settled and ordered a small one of this i admit it it was overwhelming but it warms you up like you wouldn 39 t believe hard to believe that this was my first foray into single malts was so impressed i went to a nearby grocery store and bought a bottle to share with my flatmates the jury was out in that regard but hey more great whisky for me i love the heaviness of this whisky and i love the smoke the smoke sticks with you for what seems like an age perfect for wintry nights stormy days or intense introspection  i like the smokey islay aspect but i 39 m not too fond of the medicinal kinda flavor even on the nose it makes me feel like i 39 m standing inside a pharmacy not bad wouldn 39 t buy again because of that medicinal taste and smell port askaig gt laphroaig  it 39 s an acquired taste and after getting acquainted with the taste one will find it hard to leave it presentation laphroaig has an understated elegance to their packaging and labelling and the flagship 10 year old bottling is no exception black text and iconography on a plain white background with green edging and the trademark laphroaig green glass bottle classy appearance bright golden colour with consistency maintained through the addition of e150 caramel colouring and chill filtration a common practice with larger distillery s flagship bottlings aroma smoke and something akin to a medicine cabinet the addition of a little water cuts through the smoke and brings out faint fruit i am reminded of sniffing a rockmelon cantaloupe in the supermarket to see if it 39 s ripe but i have no idea how a ripe rockmelon should smell compared to an unripe one flavour smoky bitterness a combination of flavours that are hard to differentiate but go together very well water brings out sweet vanilla and some oak spiciness finish long and dry but not as i remember it my mouth does not fill with swirling smoke but rather the smoke lingers on the tongue and builds slightly with a gentle warming at the back of the throat would i buy it again i would and i have you cannot go wrong with laphroiag 10 year old and i often recommend it for the more adventurous of the whisky curious peat smoke is the star of this whisky and it is unashamedly up front and quite literally in your face whiskydad fantastic blend of smoke iodine and slightly sweet notes the flavors blend together so well i can honestly say i never get tired of the taste you have to work your way up to this one to fully enjoy it 39 s potential wow i went to an expensive restaurant and because they had such an extensive whiskey menu i asked them to help me broaden my whiskey horizons they sent over two fingers of this and i 39 m sorry i felt compelled to drink it i felt like if i didn 39 t sit with it and drink the whole thing i wouldn 39 t really remember the taste and for better or worse i wanted to remember it i 39 m one of those newbies that love whiskey that tastes like oak or lives on the sherry end of the spectrum like macallan but i wanted to learn more and branch out as far as the taste went it was way too industrial tasting i could see how some people might get really attached to the taste but in my opinion it had a tinny metallic taste and something else i totally get the review that thought it tasted of petrol there was a moment when i thought someone had actually played a sociopathic joke on me and put kerosine in my glass the last sip i took i held in my mouth for a bit and within seconds the skin on the inside of my lips was swollen and inflamed it 39 s been a month since and i can 39 t drink the two times i have tried i found my liver wan 39 t producing the needed enzymes to metabolise alcohol i woke up feeling as if i pounded a six pack instead of half a beer with dinner and now a month later i think i 39 m getting shingles i have always practiced moderation had good health and regular health care but my immune system is completely crippled i 39 m visiting this site trying to figure out if laphroaig is really so industrial tasting as all that maybe a mean psychotic bartender really did poison me if not i admire those of you who can palate this  bought this after finishing a bottle of ardmore legacy a birthday gift from my brother i read some good reviews about it so delved into my curiosity as a beginner whisky drinker diving into a heavy smokey peated malt was perhaps a risky move but it isn 39 t as smoky as the ardmore legacy i enjoy drinking this as it has a homely air of saltiness although a little too much of an unnatural artificial like many others have said 39 hospital dusty taste 39 however this is fairly easy to overcome after a few drams and would recommend to others to take a gamble and explore their taste buds with this fine and slightly unusual specimen of a scotch  was at a lounge that didn 39 t have my go to lagavulin 16 so i asked for what they had that was the smokiest he was a child and babled for a bit and another patron said quot try the laphroaig if you don 39 t mind peat won 39 t hurt the wallet either quot i tried and was pleasantly surprised 12 for a few ounces and it was smokey still not my lag 16 but a good scotch this my be a permanent placement in my cabinet  just read the review below definition of quot on point quot open your mind open your palate and enjoy the elixir  not much to add beyond what has been said in your tasting notes a strong iodine tang at first followed by oaky smokey sweetness reminiscent of ardbeg 10 though i think i like the ardbeg just a tiny bit more reviews like quot ugh quot make me chuckle these people really think they 39 re making a valid criticism of the whisky rather than just making a fool of themselves don 39 t they there is so so much more to islay whiskies than the quot hospital quot iodine taste it 39 s like listening to the first few seconds of a led zeppelin song and then going out telling everyone it just sounds like two dustbin lids crashing together i would advise training your palate a bit more before sharing your opinions if you stick with single malts long enough to see what we see in it i promise that you will be embarrassed that you ever wrote something so dismissive i speak from personal experience  sweet smoky and medicinal with a pleasant long finish just a little water required no more than a teaspoon or so  i hope to one day to have developed my palate so i can drink let alone enjoy these iodine islay malts unfortunately i 39 m some way off  my go to dram huge smoke that just keeps on coming but doesn 39 t mask the other flavours the whiskey that gives and gives  reminds me of a hospital smooth enough considering but hospital taste bottom line very dry taste this time around ok but not the same as the last bottle i had  i do like a single malt but o boythis 1 it 39 s like drinking tcpunless i 39 ve got the cleaning fluid sorry but not for mealan from stoke on trent this is without question the king of single malts smoke peat and iodine with sweetness just beautiful well priced bloody good gaelic water  after trying many scotches this is without a doubt the best scotch you can buy at a decent price if you want to drink something that will knock your head side to side drink this if you want something that tastes like scotland and masculinity drink this there is nothing better i love this scotch it is vibrant peaty salty and as dynamic as a scottish seaside with a gale coming in it looks very unobtrusive a light gold color it smells like smoke wood tar and the sea the taste will test you if you like smoke and lots of it here you are the finish is oily complex and awesome i 39 d love to move to islay from new jersey but most likely won 39 t instead i 39 ll dream about it with a glass of laphroaig  best thing i ever tasted after removing carbs from my diet i was looking for scotches that could replace beer i started with talisker it wasn 39 t bad and i tried various others like bowmore but what really got me into scotch was this laphroaig 10 years it was love at first taste it is fucking delicious how else can i describe it i kinda wish it wasn 39 t alcoholic so i could neck it all the time it 39 s amazing on the rocks and refreshing but neat it 39 s something else really for this availability and price it 39 s a winner  i wish they hadnt cleaned the cask with petrol i have been enjoying whiskeys whiskys single malts scotches and bourbons for 40 years this is by far the least palatable for me  far from an expert this was about my 15th bottle of scotch fourth brand and my first foray into islay scotches honestly the first taste of it reminded me of the smell of diaper rash ointment 2nd sip closed bottle i will try to get used to it but will probably give it away it has a lot of flavor but so does 3 day old road kill i 39 ve tasted liquid smoke straight from the bottle this is not as good with three other varieties to fall back on i can 39 t see forcing myself to like this one  the smoke and peat is an acquired taste but when you acquire it boy is this good  great value for money fantastic classic islay whisky that you 39 ll love or hate  it is like drinkin 39 a smoky bonfire  i can get this at costco for under 30 us while not my all time favorite it is absolutely for sure the best value available for a solid kick you in the face islay keep up the good work  better than best mcl i 39 ve said lagavulin 16 is my favorite scotch thus far so consider that a king 39 s finest but laphroaig 10 is definitely a nobleman it 39 s doesn 39 t quite measure up in terms of that intoxicatingly brilliant nasal umbrage that lgv16 delivers but it 39 s there and it isn 39 t humble i think the reduction of the iodine seaweed similar things aroma actually works well here because it lets you actually recognize the peppery pop that laphroaig has there is a bit of spicy lingering in the mouth but it 39 s not bad and does not affect the throat  my first purchase of a bottle of scotch laphroaig 10 yr the first whiff knocked me back so smoky it was an earlier post mentioned a quot sharpie marker quot yes very similar in smell at first the first sip slow heat moved through my chest and abdomen one radiating inch at a time who needs heat in the winter just sip this a bit overwhelmed by the smokiness i added 3 4 drops of water really that little into 1 2 ounces of scotch i 39 d read enough about opening up the esters and changing the chemistry so i was eager to taste the difference well that little bit of water made all the difference i love it it 39 s an easy smooth sip but very gratifying a deep whiff makes you feel like you 39 re standing in a peat bog i gave the before after water tastes to my wife and she said it almost tasted like an entirely different brand i 39 m a total novice so everyone 39 s comments about other flavors vanilla licorice citrus i 39 m not there yet i 39 m just basking in the deep smoke and peat and the warmth spreading through my body  going going gone it 39 s a quot home run baby quot this is my second foray into islay 39 s eye luhs single salts bunnahabhain 12 yr s m was my first laphroaig 10 pronounced la froyg being my second is definitely an outstanding libation i give it 5 out of 5 stars and it 39 s truly indescribably delicious but i will do my best to convey my appreciation of the scotch whisky nose laphroaig smells medicinal at first blush but blossoms into a bouquet of peat laced floral scents palate liquid smoke which is a substance used in cooking to induce a hickory based smoke flavor some notes of sherry flavorings of charred wood from a smoky campfire sites and a heaping muscular helping of peat pow and boom at the end of the day it 39 s smoke and peat baby it 39 s definitely not for the uninitiated or the quot haters quot closed minded or those unwilling to broaden their horizon 39 s of libation exploration if that 39 s you just say no or stay home and drink milk ha ha ha finish a drink that 39 s been barbequed on the grill marinated in liquid smoke and smoked on the grill over smoldering wood chips saturated in peat water it 39 s a quot forget me not quot for sure friend enjoy history about me i 39 m a novice went to a scotch tasting for the first time last summer 2015 in wash d c the varieties offered were aberlour oban balvenie and yamazki 12 yr single malt sm the pours were in plastic containers cups the overhead ceiling fans were on blowing down onto the crowd and the drinks which in my opinion oxidized the scotches just setting out at the different tasting stations but hands down for me was the yamazki 12 yr s m my recent m of m purchases nikka w from the barrell japanese paul john w peated indian yamazaki reserve japanese and nikka all malt japanese but since then i 39 ve experienced bunnahabhain 12 yr s m dalmore 12 yr s m laphroaig 10 yr s m and iwai japanese all locally purchased from a place called quot kings liquor store quot right here in rosedale maryland of the good ole 39 usa all reasonably priced if ever in the area you 39 ve got to stop by there and check them out i 39 m waiting to get my hands on some ardbeg quot uigeadail quot and some lagavulin 16 yr s m i may have to order that from mom rating of the four scotches i rec 39 d from mom nikka fr the barrell was number one for me however my number two was paul john select cask it 39 s simply to die for but don 39 t do it live on and enjoy the scotch the quot nose quot by far for me as a novice stood alone when you first whiff the aroma your olfactory glands and brain reverberate saying quot whoah what is that quot oak chemical what the aroma captivates and assaults your nose like a muhammed ali right hook coming at you from out of nowhere prompting you to say quot where 39 d the hell did that come from quot but i do agree with the chaps at m of m mom the nose is very earthy not sure about the salt though as for the palate mom is quot spot on quot bbq smoke quot all the way relative to the finish there is something about the flavor quite can 39 t put my finger on it that lingers on your tongue long after you 39 ve finished the dram shot snifter or whatever your choice of drinking glass is just do me a favor quot no plastic cups quot please use an acceptable drinking glass and always drink responsibly closing after a few more trials of world famous scotches i 39 m going to have to stop referring to myself as a quot novice quot maybe i 39 ll upgrade to quot journeyman quot bon appetite  i am new to scotch whisky i 39 ve had many bourbons and american whiskeys my introduction to single malt scotch was highland park 12 which i found really underwhelming after all the rave reviews i did like the finish which i came to find out was peat so i decided to jump right into islay from there and bought a bottle of laphroaig 10 wow the smokiness the saltiness and that sweetness are like nothing i 39 ve ever tasted in my life a lot of people say not to try this if you 39 re a beginner and we were a little intimidated and afraid we might be wasting 50 but man well worth it it really does invoke the feelings of a campfire beside the ocean it 39 s warming it 39 s comforting it 39 s rich and delicious the finish is long and lingering and makes you want to dive in for another sip the medicinal smells and flavors are very pleasant as well i know it sounds disgusting but it 39 s oddly inviting i like this over ardbeg 10 as well as i feel ardbeg lacks in the salt and sweet compared to laphroaig my overall scotch experience in order is this hp 12 laphroaig 10 glenfiddich 12 caol ila 12 ardbeg 10 i know that 39 s not a lot but laphroaig really stands out as the favorite  sharpie marker band aid rank ass a bit of water opens it up and we get more familiar citrus vanilla and wood notes i feel like i could enjoy this a lot given time and it 39 s different from what i was expecting a lot of smoke in blends like jw makes it somewhat familiar perhaps i should have tried highland park talisker or even jw double black first before going off the deep end it seems like too much too soon either way glad to know what 39 s out there as someone who is more experienced with speyside malts and blends  big palate big nose big finish bigger bottle it 39 s scotland for you  laphroig quot laff royg quot my first islay after sampling a dram i bought a bottle love the smokiness although this bottle i bought is 43 with a bit more bite then the dram i sampled i 39 m usually on the opposite end of the spectrum ahh yes the lowlend my favorite is auchentoshan 3 wood because of the 3 wood and dark color i love the taste of the dark sweet fruity and woody smooth subtle and sweet yet complex and full flavored scotch finished in oloroso then pedro ximenez sherry casks but it does not match the quot feel quot of this quot la froyg quot islay scotch the warmth the smoke and the buzz is a bit better with this islay auchentoshan still my favorite as i drink scotch first for the flavor just wish the 3 wood gave a bit more warmth and buzz not sure why it doesn 39 t since it 39 s about the same proof perhaps it 39 s the triple distillation anyways this islay is definitely nice and smoky bandaidy and sweet yet just smooth enough for being a 10 year gave meh a bit of peaty heartburn but i loved every second of it this is an amazing scotch and well priced i found mine for 45 a bottle though as luck would have it i got mine even a bit cheaper oh btw they fit in tomatin boxes  i am a single malt fan generally glenmorange type a friend of mine told me about strange whiskey he ever tried called laphroaig he warned me of unexplainable taste and suggested to keep glass of water nearby in case tasting goes wrong i told my husband about it and he got it for me to try it wasn 39 t love at first taste but i kept craving it ever since i tried and now officially in love also did extensive search into peety islays and found another love of mine adberg its just darn good just try  my first taste of laphroaig was the px cask and it was kind of like that scene in harold and kumar where they ride the cheetah it was intense unfathomably awesome and full of smoke after the px cask i found the 10 year to be still quite nice and fantastic for the price but without the rich complexity of the px the 10 year still has anything you want in a laphroaig and it would be my standard go to in a pub but for a special occasion i would recommend trying out the px or at least the triple wood if you want to go that extra mile  the review by angus carmichael says it all i have been appreciating scotch for almost a decade but i 39 ve been too set on stopping when i find something i like not ambitious enough until recently my first single malt was aberlour 12 i simply picked one after sampling dewar 39 s and walker i fell in love then came the balvenie and many others some recognizable some obscure but only about a year ago did i venture to islay ardbeg was my first dram and i didn 39 t immediately fall in love with it however it left me with a taste that i didn 39 t get from speyside or the highlands i went back bowmore 15 year darkest pushed me further then i tried lagavulin 12 cask strength followed by the bowmore 12 in between were tastes of bunnahabhain and the ones i knew i tried laphroaig at a bar about four months ago and finally bought a bottle i have been converted to islay and don 39 t know if i can go back even amazing speyside and highland offerings are missing something laphroaig 10 year is so simple so smooth so amazingly tasty i shudder to imagine what i still haven 39 t found but i 39 m excited to get there i gave only four stars because i haven 39 t tried them all but i had to leave a review because i love it i appreciate all whiskies but they now leave me wanting something they don 39 t have only islay can quench my thirst cheers  my go to whiskey for such a reasonable price too never fails to bring a smile to my face when i get the waft of peaty goodness from the glass beautiful long finish  as lover of laphroaig i was recently surprised and disappointed in a recent 10 year bottle i understand about bottle variation but this one was below even that as ive probably consumed over 200 bottles through the years i 39 ll put this down to bad luck but ill be reviewing my bext bottle with slight caution dont let us down laphroaig bottle was bought from asda i have been into the more peaty and wood smoke balanced scotch whiskeys and laphroaig 10 is exceptional for only being aged 10 years it brings a lot of character and maturity in both its flavor and scent if you prefer smokey peat whiskey over rye and citrus blends this will be the very best bang for your buck  probably the best a whisky can get enjoying my third dram of laphroaig 10 i am a novice to whisky in general but i love the peatiness of this whisky i am still developing my nose and with laphroaig 10 it is a rich sweet caramel candy to my palate it is all peat which reminds me of the experience of drinking lapsong sojong tea hearth in a glass great on a winter 39 s night after clearing snow warm and comforting the finish is silky oil with smoke remaining i have recalled the silky oil feel the next day bringing me back to the hearth  normally i like the glenlivet nadurra 16 yr and the balvenie double wood 12 yr dh said we must try the laphroaig 10 yr and i loved it smoky autumnal black walnuts wet earth sweet taste with a rugged leathery finish and an astringent medicinal aftertaste if a single malt was a person this would be a lumberjack  this is a very straight oriented smoked whiskey you get smokenes and smoothness but not much more it lucks complexity in my opinion the first 3 5 sips are good but after that it gets a bit boring and i don 39 t want a second glass of it not like talisker or lagavulin that i love them both  i named my son pete because i like this whisky so much  this is a very good peated smoked whiskey my criticism is that it is to straight lots of peat and smoke that i love but no much more complexity in the taste not like lagavulin or my favorite talisker a mast for the smokey whiskey lovers  i 39 m an rn so the first thing i taste smell is iodine but you need to get past that to actually get the smokey peaty spicy taste it 39 s not for the single malt newbies but it is amazing i love laphroaig and its my go to single malt every time  if you like compost old fireplace and iodine its brilliant i love it and have done so for many years a real hardcore face punching whiskey and not for the lightweight barleywater lovers if you like it fruity and subtle with a hint of whiskey then its to be avoided i give it 20 out of 10  this whisky is very potent with a lot of the taste of burnt clutch rubber sweltering sewage and industrial cleaner add a nip of water and those flavour ease up but remain more subtly the whisky 39 s character is then a melody of something that i think is far more floral than i had expected maybe even sweet ish great whisky of course  i recently purchased a bottle of your laphroaig 10 year old whiskey i noted that drinkers found the following traits spices liquorice vanilla sweetness honey lemon tobacco butter pears the list goes on it seems to me that your brewmaster forgot to put these flavours into my bottle and merely infused it with a disgusting taste of burnt peat after three tastings i passed it on to my son his verdict pour it down the sink an expensive waste  laphroaig tastes like the gun deck of a ship of the line and bravery  i live very near to a large supermarket and they have offers on single malts all year round this bottle was a present however and when opened it had a very bad taste i have purchased and drank laphroaig 10 year old whiskey in the past and it has been very nice so i am sorry to add this review but there are at least 2 other reviews in the last couple of months with the same experience  i 39 m only recently 39 getting into 39 single malts so have tried to sample ones from the different regions to get an overall feel of what 39 s out there my first island whisky was ardbeg 10 so perhaps my experience of this whisky was not as neutral as others have been that said i really really like it not as much of a punch in the face as the ardbeg imo but seems to have more of a balance of flavours and a lovely lingering finish that was evocative of rotting seaweed it 39 s like ardbeg an odd one you should not enjoy these flavours yet they seem to work for me takes me away to holidays in west scotland as a nipper or to any cold wet and windy beach on these isles wonderful stuff but a bit like marmite i guess which i also like  i 39 ve been trying to think of a smell flavor to compare it to finally came up with the waterproofing my grandfather used on his canvas tent fond memories that being said the key word is strong my wife is not a fan says i stink up a whole room when i have a bit and her point is  this scotch is fantastic it has a bug smokey flavor and finish almost sweet my first thought when i took a sip was of honey and a camp fire  by far the best tasting scotch i 39 ve ever had smooth smoky beautiful  strong smokiness with tarry finish medium body with hints of lemon tobacco and earth amazing to match with a cigar and would taste awesome for cigar lovers mesmerizing on the nose  that smoky tarry finish is amazing probably not for everyone but the finish only made me give this an extra star than i would have it almost tastes like delicious trash must try you might love it  a little disappointing it 39 s a nice whisky but a little tame compared to the ardbeg 10 other reviewers seem to think it 39 s better so i guess it 39 s all down to individual taste the ardbeg tasted like tcp filtered through last night 39 s bonfire this just tastes like a really good whisky  i recently over the last three years have beeen getting into scotch i 39 ve tried glenmorangie glengranth and chivas 12 although these are good i wanted to find a very good in single malt scotch that was not going to be over 40 it took two times to try it i almost didn 39 t want it anymore but i appreciated the deep flavors added just a little bit of water it does open up more flavors with a dab of water i 39 m no scotch expert but laphroaig grew on me after the second time and i will buy it again cheers  i was given a bottle for christmas let 39 s just say that this scotch is further proof you can get used to anything when i drink scotch i want it to be a pleasure a memorable experience that i would like to repeat with this scotch that is not possible it speaks to second sentence if you want to test your ability to adapt to something that tastes horrible try this scotch stunning pairs perfectly with a heavy cigar and tom waits records  hello nail polish remover smell or dentist office scent tasted even worse  it appears that a lot of people have to develop a taste for this liquor i was in love with this from my first slip i never experienced a nose from a liquor like the nose from laphroaig i think it might be my age i think if i had tried this 20 earlier in my life i might not have liked it i love how the nose wraps the mask of your face it 39 s almost as relaxing as it is drinking it  burning hospital supplies inc gauze tcp plasters and old tyres mix in drying seeweed jugs of sea water lumps of peat and we 39 re halfway there add to the mix butter vanilla cream some mouldy iced fruit cake pears and a little bacon and stir finally simmer slowly with iron railings lead filings and sulpherous gases remarkable effort and unsurpassed in this original thought prevoking style  peat and wood smoke a lot of smoke some spices too and salty greetings from the coast iodine taste hints of seaweed and some smooth vanilla yes it 39 s smooth the finish is big and interesting and drying hints of salt the finish reminds me of the medical nose big complex whisky  after my first taste i was sure i 39 d wasted my money by the time the bottle was half gone a week later i knew i 39 d buy another smells like smoked antiseptic at first it tastes like burning garbage and old cow manure mixed with plastic after a while i realized i liked it anyway antiseptic barnyard peat bog fire and i really do like it  for my palette this smells absolutely awful i will concede though that it does taste much better than i though it would based on the aroma one that i just about enjoyed a tumbler of but wouldn 39 t part with my own money for a whole bottle  wowon my nose peat smoke and smoke and peat palette more smoke and peat but developed into a sweet salty ocean breeze pleasure that begs for more i can also note orange or lemon zest that tingles the lips there is a peppered burn as you swallow but soon replaced with a oils maybe butter sweet richness count me in mike from by god iowa i 39 ve tried numerous single malts over the years but i keep coming back to the laphroaig 10 year old as my all time favorite others particularly from islay may equal it in peatiness and smokiness but nothing else including other more expensive offerings from the laphroaig distillery can equal this whiskey for its overall balance flavor and most especially its glorious finish which persists on the tongue and palate long after the last sip has been downed like an old friend lingering by your fire engaging in deep and meaningful conversation what i 39 ve noticed in other people 39 s reactions is that very few people are neutral about laphroaig either they love it or they hate it but if you have not yet tried it you definitely owe it to yourself maybe you like me will discover the scotch than which there is no than whicher  i 39 m relatively new to the world of whiskey and experiencing the different flavours when i read this whiskey was 39 medicinal 39 and had 39 peat 39 notes i didn 39 t know what that was but wanted to experience it i bought a bottle it was like drinking the juice from a lump of smoking turf very strong smokey combined with a mixture of old school anti septic not for me but not to say many won 39 t like it i 39 ve experienced it and i am glad i have but not for me  usually i get this saliva gland pain from wine i think it 39 s due to the sulfates i was surprised that i had this issue with the laphroaig 10yo as i had no such issues with the limited 15yo other than that its pretty solid tasting it 39 s not nearly as good as the 15yo which has more easily discernible complexities however it is basically the same thing just brighter and more straightforward  lafroig 10 yotasting note by us with john campbell at laphroaig distillerynose this opens on big smoky muscular peat notes there are spices and liquorice as well as a big dose of salt this whisky has become slightly sweeter in recent years and it beautifully on the nose amidst the classic iodine sticking plasters and cool wood smoke we love palate seaweed led with a hint of vanilla ice cream and more than a whiff of notes from the first aid box tcp plasters etc the oak is big and muscles its way into the fore as you hold this whisky over your tongue an upsurge of spices develop cardamom black pepper chilli finish big and drying as the savoury tarry notes build up with an iodine complexity  fantastic whisky heavily peated scotches seem to be a love hate thing good thing i love it i 39 ve had a full range of american bourbons amp ryes so i was used to decently strong flavor and high alcoholic content over 40 45 so i knew i could handle big flavor tried the usual blended scotches and a few highland single malts was ready for something totally different this was it amazing flavor notes include olive brinepetroleum oil soaked woodsalty seaweediodinesweetness vanilla cakethis is the only whisky that truly transported me with its flavor close your eyes and imagine a rocky islay shore with a cool humid sea breeze blowing over soaked seaweed and into your face at dusk with a peat fire burning and the smoke is mixing with the sea wind beautiful this is a whisky meant to be truly savored don 39 t rush it pour it into a glencairn glass let it sit take it nice and slow think about the past decade of your life this stuff spent aging this is a very well made drink lovely  mmmmmm mm mm m  aroma was that of chloroseptic throat medicine with an after taste as if i had just smoked an entire bowl from a bong not for everyone  not unpleasant but it certainly is different an antiseptic iodine nose with bold smoky flavor just enough burn going down with very nice afterglow and an aftertatse that does not linger long not my first choice but i can imagine it going well with a fine steak  like drinking earth and smoke  i was tasting this exellent single malt at quot the bell quot in edinburgh this evening i bring a bottle or two with me back to narvik in norway  so i tried this whisky very recently didnt expect this dram to be so different from my every day whisky like glenfiddichs and the glenlivets and glenmorangies it has this taste that isnt my cup of tea my opinion is this whisky is either the whisky that suits your palate or does not suit your palate  between occasionally shelling out for a lagavulin or an oban 14 laphroig 10 would be my go to off the shelf dram definitely an acquired taste but once you do it becomes a first choice time and time again  i tried the 10 year for the first time last evening and it had a strong medicinal smell that reminded me of rubbing alcohol i added a bit of ice and i toned it down however i will be sticking with highland park 10 year in the future much smoother and easier on the nose  i always wanted to try this one and was kind of afraid i had worked myself into peated whiskies with bowmore 12 amd talisker on the nose laphroaig really delivers what is expected smoke all over the place but especially those medicinal phenolic qualities are really demanding to non peat heads i am not exactly in love whith it but i find it very interesting it is the mouth that left me cold it is sweet but too weak to compensate for the smoke compared it straight with talisker there really isn 39 t much going on apart from sweet smoke i think laphroaig should bottle this at 43 or 46 like ardbeg all in all an interesting experience but not a fan  the nose is inviting fragrant soothing the texture is full slightly oily but still transparent dark on the palate i get a slight tingle just enough to remind me that i 39 m still drinking whisky not water this is good peat smoke and medicinal herbs the afterglow hits me with a warming earthy taste that somehow reminds me of a stinging nettle good stuff this whisky is my favorite one the moment i open a brand new box i am excited by the smell of smoke even if the bottle hasn 39 t been opened yet one must realized that this isn 39 t a standard dram it smells of wooden fire tastes like it too but if you are a peat lover you will enjoy it until the last drop  i had read quite a bit about this malt whisky before i tried it and everything i read had told me that laphroaig is something one either loves or hates after finally getting the opportunity to taste laphroaig 10 i guess i am in minority in that i neither love it nor hate it it is quite decent but not great and it certainly isn 39 t dreaful  this malt tastes of being punched in the mouth with a charred brine soaked oak branch and then instead of using band aids to patch the wounds you just ate them instead  of course a drink like this isn 39 t going to be for everyone but if you like this style laphroaig 10 really never disappoints the other laphroaig offerings are also excellent but even if they were all the same price i 39 d still oftentimes choose the 10 its just got its own special zing  when i first started drinking scotch i thought laphoaig was disgusting and could not believe it was made for human consumption a few years later and with a more refined palate it has become my favorite scotch fantastic flavor profile like no other wonderful in my view and many other whisky lovers this whisky is as good as whisky can get nobodies taste buds are identical which is why people have preferences my preference being 10yr old for those who wish to put irn bru coke or whatever mix they prefer into a whisky i would recommend they buy another cheaper whisky which wont spoil the taste of their soft drink  the smell is wonderful but the tase is dior i don 180 t like it it should taste like it smells  look here this is the classic islay peated single malt there will be peat smoke and lots of it there will be that medicinal iodine taste and that is what makes it famous if you drink single malts for any time you will grow fond of this dram the finish is quite long and that is also one of the great things about it if you are a rookie to single malts probably not the one to start with if you are feint of heart laphroaig 10 is a great value and the iconic islay malt  i 39 m a fairly new scotch drinker dabbled in highlands glenmorangie and macallan and a bit of speyside balvenie before getting curious enough to make the jump to islay drinking this sends me back to barnegat bay in new jersey spending the afternoon on my grandpa 39 s sailboat and coming home to my uncle grilling dinner on the back patio saltwater smoke just overall a wonderful experience  i tasted it on local pub resent day it it not for my taste range at all i like a less peatier whisky there is something in the burnt flavour that i dont like but the finish is more sweet from barley  i have tried many different scotch over the years but have never smelled anything so much like bad medicine wow it 39 s really bad i can 39 t drink this scotch based on the pungent strange medicinal smell and will try to return the 95 i have not drank to the store where i purchased  tasted this one on local pub i knew it was very peated for me it tastes artifical and very characeristic smoky flavour like someone has bite it and chewed it first but i find it has some barley sweetness in the finish i will go for the little less smokier drams instead  i desided to try this at the local pub as i have heard and read much about it knew it was very peated i get medicine sulphur roasted charcoal some barley sweetness in the finish almost sickening for me i got it down anyway well malty mates some like the mother some like the daughter i prefer the daughter and stick to my talisker 10  why haven 39 t i tried this whisky by now i love islays love ardbeg lagavulin bunnahabain just recently bought this and wow i am in love with this the nose the taste the burn everything about this is wonderful i love sherried whisky as well but the perfect peat and smoke in lap 10 is enchanting can 39 t seem to bring myself to drink any others with this one around great great whisky  i am new to islay whiskys bunnahabhain 12 year and lagavulin 16 being the only 2 examples i had tried up until now but picked up a bottle of this at trader joes today for 40 today and i think i 39 ve found a new favorite so much smoke and seaweed starts out quite peppery and yes tastes a little like band aids but not as much as some reviews would suggest also a hint of vanilla ice cream i can totally imagine drinking this till i am an old man can 39 t wait to try more from laphroaig they really know what they are doing this is some serious scotch good dram tho i prefer jw green label in that price range wow you must be really cool and such a man since you like this good for you vvvv laphroaig is some amazing stuff if you don 39 t like this then i am assuming you haven 39 t hit puberty yet and need your man card taken away the powerful flavor will sock you in the mouth over and over again a few drops of water really opens this dram for all those giving this legend bad reviews then go back to your 20 dewars and a fridge full of pbrs  liked it in the past but bottle i got for christmas and which i 39 ve just opened tastes like a horrible mix of manufactured chemicals have they changed the formulation  laphroaig and ardbeg for president  its like a pair of old slippers i always come back to it nothing i have tried can take me away from this one i always have a bottle spare for when the other green bottle is empty  loving the reviews on this one nothing meadiocre you either love the punchy quot burning hopital quot taste or don 39 t but don 39 t give up on first taste add a splash of water to spread the flavours out a bit delicious  if you 39 re bored with heavy sherry whisky then maybe you should spice it up with laphroaig 10 i haven 39 t tried their other products but if the quality permits laphroaig will always be in my home every glass is just a new experience of flavor it might not be everybody 39 s top 5 but if you haven 39 t experienced the strong flavors of laphroaig then you 39 re missing out  i might be biased because laphroaig 10 was my first single malt but i love it and every one of their expressions i put the qa cask travel retail exclusive the 10 year cask strength a monster and the triple wood above the standard 10 year but for the price this is my go to  i got this in a pack and had a hip flasks in now nor adverse to unusual taste but the medicinal taste in this really killed it for the bottle that came with it had two nips in but only took one and best describe as drinking tcp the taste was in my mouth for hours and could not rid myself of it at risk of being lambasted by all those who thoroughly enjoy this from the other reviews i personally couldn 39 t get past the nose on this one i don 39 t mind smoke and saltiness but this unfortunately lost all of its appeal when all i could smell was what i feel is best described as simply artificial liquid smoke obviously this is a unique malt with its overly abundance of peat smoke and salty qualities so i assume those that love it love it while others may find it very difficult to see any appeal  my first taste was a fantastic sensation the second best whisky i have ever tasted thank you very much  if this was cheaper here in ireland i 39 d buy an unlimited supply of this d the quarter cask is not as good as it used to be but i find great comfort in this one heavily peated but when you add a drop of water it opens up a whole range of flavors and a medium long finish i think they might have used first fill ex bourbon casks the quantity seems to be quite good i really like the balance between heavy peat and all the other flavors i highly recommend this one but stay away from the non h statement versions the default malt for the lover of smoke and peat i love the rugged harshness of it certainly not everyone 39 s cup of tea and perhaps not one for a new whisky lover but it 39 s absolutely everything you hope for from ancislay  the first time i tasted a laphroaig 10 i almost spat it out only politeness and the eagerness on my brother in law 39 s face prompted me to hold on to it and force a sound of appreciation a week later the taste was still on my mind but i wanted to taste it without supervision and make up my own mind on the way home i bought a bottle of quarter cask from the very first taste i loved it quarter cask reconciled me to the muscle of laphroaig but now i have gone back to the 10 for its boldness it 39 s also easier to find here if you don 39 t like laphroaig the first time you taste it do yourself a favor and don 39 t write it off until you 39 ve gone through a bottle also a shout out to all other malt loving ladies simply too few of us  i tried talisker a few weeks ago and had to choke it down as i imagine anyone who 39 s not accustomed to a strong peaty smoky scotch does so now i 39 m into the laphroig and the first dram was a bit on the ugh side but now that i 39 ve had a couple sips it 39 s getting tastier and tastier i typically enjoy the lighter speyside drams but thought i 39 d grow my tastes and enjoy some of the islay varieties i 39 d definitely say this has a ton of flavour and lingers pleasantly on the tongue the nose is reminiscent to me of coal smoke but that only reminds me of being back in ireland i definitely wouldn 39 t recommend this to an uninitiated scotch consumer but for those of us that have tried the lighter scotches and liked them it 39 s not a bad change  laphroiag 10 is 39 my scotch 39 if i drink any other it 39 s only because my green bottle is empty strong peaty loaded with sea spray it 39 s not just a taste of scotch it 39 s a taste of scotland if i 39 m not drinking scotch i 39 m drinking rye primarily whistlepig rye is to whiskey what laphroiag is to scotch strong powerful complex favors  this is a very powerful full flavoured scotch which represents the smoky islay style of malt from what i have read i tried aberlour and bowmore before but apart from that am new to single malts i like this it is smoky and has a kind of medicinal flavour that i like but others may not it is like the bowmore but even further in the same direction subtle it isnt but it is a whisky with a strong character and its gained a new follower in me its nay for the lassies cheers  i never really could get into scotch that much i usually prefer rye 39 s and bourbon 39 s like michters and booker respectively that changed with this i pretty much can 39 t stomach any other scotches except the peated varieties like laphroaig and lagavullin i can drink blends like johnnie walker but anything other than that and the islay scotches and quot no thanks i 39 m not interested quot this is the best of them in my opinion way better than lagavullin and much cheaper if you like smoke this is your bottle  okay so i 39 m a bourbon drinker who prefers big bold bourbons like bookers noah 39 s mill and knob creek barrel strength i recently had the good fortune of acquiring a bottle of george t stagg 2014 once that happened i strangely went thru a period of remorse unless i stumbled upon a bottle of pappy 39 s i might have reached my zenith in the bourbon world so i bravely saddled up and decided to try some single malts i purchased a bottle of macallan 12 and it was a wonderful drink smooth mellow and so much different than bourbon i thoroughly enjoyed it but i wondered how much different could scotch be so the next night i purchased a bottle of laphroig 10 bottled at 43 abv in the states i poured a dram and damn did it smell like a campfire i added a few drops of water and let is breath for 15 minutes or so and took my first drink at first is was big and bold not entirely unlike a bourbon i could taste the sweetness and the oak but then the smoke and the peat took over in the finish and i wasn 39 t at all sure i liked it i finished the dram with mixed feelings and the next morning i could still taste the smoke it tasted like i 39 d smoked cigars all night but here 39 s where it gets interesting the next night i went back to the macallan 39 s and damn if it didn 39 t taste thin and and i don 39 t know just missing something it felt very uninspired so i poured myself a bit more of the laphroaig and it was wonderful the second night all my misgivings simply evaporated and i thoroughly enjoyed my dram it simply rendered the macallan 12 bland in comparison now i 39 m not sure where to go in the scotch world suggestions are gladly accepted  way to peaty for my pallet i felt like i was drinking a pine tree i know it 39 s good stuff just not for me having previously tried the quarter cask i found this more reserved definately pretty easy to drink and in no way a 39 peat monster 39 i would call this a good entry islay to get the basics upon which to base further enquiries good but i deffo prefer the qc  along with lagavulin which i adore and cardhu this is a sensibly priced easy drinking malt and remains one of my favourites an easy drinking smooth whisky not as peaty as the others but a lovely regular tipple recommended  i have received a bottle of laphroaig 10 yo as a gift and it 39 s absolutely perfect beware though it 39 s definitely not for everyone 39 s taste i gave some friends to try and most of them simply hated it or even were repelled by the smell alone quot burning hospital quot as one of the comments have stated here is the most suitable description for this scotch however for those who enjoy smoky scotch this one is a must to try  i have been drinking scotch for about 14 years and i drink it neat i have tried as much variety as i could afford and was excited to try this one in a whisky bar last year i didnt want it after the first sip i really cannot fathom why anyone would it is almost painful it is so bad i migt use it to cauterize a wound but that 39 s it this is the only scotch i have ever had that i didnt like in some way  i 39 m a rookie with single malts but have tried many and liked them all thus far this really opened my eyes to the many flavors a single malt can show and the array of those flavors taste buds dancing disco not bad but try the 12 year and the quarter cask excellent  one of the best scotches i have had the pleasure of imbibing it is my favorite this and lagavulin 16 i think the 10 is actually better than the 18 which seems too mellow in comparison absolutely lovely and a very well priced too smoky peaty with an underlying sweetness but not too sweet like the 18  as my quest progressed i was getting a little disappointed in some of the selections i had tried i wanted a full flavor with peat smoke a hint of leather and who knows what else nothing else had met what i expected till a friend told me about laphraoig the nose is great there is a great grape peal on first sip followed by a leathery peat and smoke the flavors expand and maintain for a good length of time making it a great sipping scotch this is my favourite  remember when you were 8 years old that big scab on your knee cap you pulled off admit it you ate it an old horse blanket listerine mouth wash a travis club senator cigar shoe polish insecticide a soiled bandaid paint burning asphalt it is absolutely delicious oh and just a bit a hint of homemade vanilla ice cream  i see that you review these before they are posted the reviews from people that just don t like it are fine but to allow reviews from people that use in for a mixer really have on relevanceron in texas laphroaig evokes one opinion or the other it seems nobody is neutral on it my wife a true scot prefers what she calls the quot subtle quot whiskies like macallan or balvenie but my taste favors the islay malts and as other reviewers point out there s nothing subtle about this malt what i like about it is that there are so many strong aromas and tastes to it while i try and buy many other malts this is the one i always come back to  can there be anything better in life than to sit at ones fireside with my old dog camilla a glass of laphroaig in hand and talk to my plants the nearest i will get to feeling like a king charles w  there are a few single malts that come close to this sort of smoky quality e g ardbeg 10 lagavulin 16 and even a blend johnnie walker double black but nothing that i have experienced yet quite hits the mark like this master of peat  i love a good single malt and laphroaig is one of my absolute faves the smokey medicinal qualities took a little to get used to one the first sip but they are what define the character of this malt so beautiful and yet so discernible to the other malts the peat is beautiful in this bottle and honestly for the price you really cant beat the experience   but this is one the first nose nearly put me off this whiskey then i tasted it burning bandages salt and iodine give way to complexity of flavors that i still find hard to describe the gentleman who desicribed them as quot burning hospital quot would not be wrong but burning in a good way the finish is a little oily like fine diesel fuel mixed with wool rags and sweaters i completely agree with the warning below that for some after experiencing laphroaig everything else seems lesser this whiskey is as subtle as a fist in the face has flavors that explode like a 1 ton bomb and a finish that stays for precisely long enough not everyone s dram of whiskey for sure but this is now my go to for cold rainy pacific northwest nights do sample this before buying a bottle  well it is not for everybody you won t drink with coke or orange and soda try before you buy  undoubtedly smokey beyond that i can t comprehend how this could be enjoyable to anyone whose sense of taste is still intact after one drink i was met with a case of shaky chest and left with a disgusting taste that was tough to erase  40 years ago my first scotch was johnny red we all start somewhere and i liked it as i have evolved i began to learn about whiskey laphroaig 10 is my drink of choice i keep other singles and blends around but when i want to ride the flavor train this is the one i reach for for those who don t like it as your taste matures this is where you will end up  it s hard to enjoy any other scotch the same after this it s like going from moscato to a good cab or from coors light to guinness you ll drink them but they won t ever taste the same laphroig 10 yr is special and deserves a class of it s own   but this was the first dram i could not finish it was vile the nose was medicinal with shoe polish and the taste for me was very unpleasant i was surprised i really like lagavulin caol ila and talisker but this was so different not for me  i ve gone through a few bottles of this and generally been happy but my most recent bottle had a very strong plaster y aroma i understand that this is within the normal range of flavors but this time it was very oddly pronounced though it weakens after letting it settle for a bit  i have just had my first taste of this whiskey and my first respinse was quot iv bern poisoned with tcp antiseptic quot sorry and so checked out other peoples reviews im glad to say im still alive and after relaxing got quite used to the flavour and aromas  drank it neat no water or ice and it is perfect full body smell and taste let it few seconds in mouth it will change your game it s something special you ll remember your first laphroaig 10 y o  this is by far a whiskey that would be sipped tasted and enjoyed i can truly say this is not a whiskey for beginners this has an advanced taste and a nose that is rich in peat and smoke i have just found my benchmark for scotches from islay well done  i ve had a couple bottles of the 18 and it s among my favorites just for the sake of it i decided to get one of these to me other than abv i find it virtually indistinguishable from the 18 i don t know whether that says more about me or laphroaig they re both terrific if you like smoky malts i ll probably keep buying the 18 just because i can afford it and it looks cooler but for non millionaires looking for an intro to islay laphroaig save your money and try this first  horrible the worst oral disinfectant you could ever taste i washed my mouth with gasoline to get the taste out  at first this laphroaig is the hooligan amongst the scotch a complete nutjob screaming in your mouth and splashing weird tastes like first aids kits and seaweed all over your tastebuds but then you realize this dram is just a big friendly bloke who wants to have a good time the big salty and smoky flavours remind of a cosy pub cloaked in a thick wall of sigarette smoke this surely is a masterpiece simply because it s so confusing and so unedged a vicious drink for vicious people rb  i ll always keep a bottle of laphroaig 10yr in the den it s certainly not as smooth on the finish as other islays of the same age but what it lacks in finish it more than makes up for in classic peaty goodness a fine example of islay whiskys this dram comes on strong with sweet oak and peat smoke quickly dries out and leaves you wanting more as an aside i have yet to encounter a more drool enticing bouquet in all my years as an islay man simply phenomenal on the nose brings me back to slow fires on cold winter days i would still recommend a smoother finishing dram for those looking to introduce friends to the world of islay singles maybe something like the caol ila moch something that comes full circle to finish  this is the first whisky i have not liked i can t believe anyone can like this drink when my wife asked what it tasted like the first thought that came to mind was disinfectant  opens with iodine on the nose very much oaky on the palate at first it has a nice sweetness to it the finish is a dry very smokey peat finish something about this leaves you wanting more definately my favourite peated scotch thus far  good whiskey for all ladies with character  this is the most distinctive and flavorful single malt that has ever been my pleasure to drink i know of no other with such a complex yet singularly distinctive flavor the smokiness of the peat oh what a pleasure to look forward to my reward at the end of each days tasks carry on laphroaig carry on  prior to trying laphroaig 10 i was not aware of just how literal a single malt could taste the nose was a cool breezy autumn night on the beach the palate took me back to connemara sharing tender moments with my wife by a peat fire it mostly reminded my wife of the frequent disappointment of burning her toast for those sea loving folks who prefer their beef rare their toast charred and their coffee black this is your dram  absolutely awful the water of death it s good to clean the rust and the toilet tastes of gas no elegance in the taste only strength kind of an industrial chemical liquid waste of money now laphroaig 10 is something else it s like the well behaved semi monstruous son of it s fully monstruous father laphroaig 10 cask strength all the characteristics of iodine salt smoke sea etc are there only slightly muted that being said i find it to be a wonderful whisky being so instantly recognizable once you ve had it for the first time women also either love or hate this whisky i love the women who love it some expressions i ve had over the years have been overly sweet for such a robust whisky it has to have a delicate balancing act between the peat the salt and the sweet savoury bitter notes  laphroaig is the best islay scotch and for all the non believer s that claim its so horrible then you just aren t an islay type of drinker no need for bashing here this is not a drink for everyone only certain seasoned scotch drinkers need apply and nowhere does ardbeg or lagavulin come close to laphroaig in quality or craftsmanship stay blessed i have been a scotch drinker for 30 years and had until recently never tried laphroaig it was recommended recently in a discussion with a new friend when he found out that i am a scotch drinker as well he said it is a quot must try quot so the next day i bought a bottle this is the most interesting scotch that i have ever tried after the first glass the jury was still out in my mind but i have had the bottle now for two weeks and have consumed about one third of it my tastebuds quickly acclimated to the taste which is different than any other scotch that i have tasted and i now have a new friend in fact i enjoy each drink more than the last the negative reviews don t surprise me because this is to other scotch what a double espresso is to a cup of decaf this is scotch for the scotch drinker and only the serious need apply if you really love scotch you will love laphroaig it is high quality stuff so don t think that it is inferior to any other scotch in its class it just has more taste my next purchase will be more laphroaig  just a fantastic whisky always my favourite and i have tried a lot of single malts keep a blended for guests you don t want to be giving this away be selfish keep it all to yourself this is just a wonderful spirit peaty smoky goodness it s bottled at 43 abv here in the united states i ll always love laphroaig 10  spot on  i do not drink a lot of scotch whisky i generally drink straight rye neat no ice however i feel that laphroaig 10 year old is a truly superior whisky i very much enjoy it neat and without any water or ice a world class product thanks to all who help produce it  i like to keep a collection of various whiskies and laphroaig quarter cask has been a repeated tenant on my cabinet since it was released a few years ago before then i always had a place for the laph 10 but here in british columbia the release of the qc took l10 of the shelves couldn t but it anywhere the qc came in at about 30 more than the l10 if memory serves but it was so good that i didn t mind today i m in my fav shop and see that the qc at 80 is not available but i can get the l10 for 100 so i went for it for old time s sake the 10 is not as friendly as the qc which is thick rich and warm like a blessed well almost like a peaty scottish bourbon with a summer sundown finish it doesn t taste a bit like bourbon but it has that finish that a good bourbon has eg knob creek the warm slow sundown in the belly the 10 is mean cruel calling to mind a wild sea against rocky beaches while we consider death however as many here have suggested a splish of water makes it more friendly and expressive i do not regret this purchase of the 10 but i will continue to prefer the qc  too sweet in fact even with two drops of water it s not for everyone i didn t like it at all don t buy it only because it comes from nearby to other whiskies you like has nothing to do with caol ila etc i hated industrial smell and the fact it is died with caramel what for nevertheless it didn t take long to find a fan of it and sell the bottle   quot no strong drinks only weak men quot exemplified  diff not sure will try again  i was given a very old looking bottle as a gift the cork fell apart when i opened the bottle and the contents had a very sharp taste it almost felt quot fizzy quot but with a little ice cold water it isn t bad  i love it i have tried the other single malts speyside malts are okay mild and nice islay malts are where there s real taste the best i ve had is this laphroaig 10 ardbeg comes in second followed by lagavulin talisker is too sweet  if you don t like peat you definitely won t like laphroaig i d fully agree with the advice to take with water the result is a revelation ive never been a huge fan of peat but with water this is wonderful stuff  for a beginner it s a wild ride but if you can hang on til the long finish you ll begin to appreciate it  gouache is a paint we used to finger paint with in primary school this whisky has a nose that is exactly gouache it also tastes like it smells i love the jura brand superstition among other single malts but when i ordered this for the first time at the restaurant tonight i was extremely disappointed i guess it is just not for me  frist islay malt i have bought and boy am i happy love the smoke and the taste just go s on and on was a bit scared to buy reading some of the reviews but what i say go for it u wont be disappointed what an enormous disappointment been wanting to try this for the longest time i ve had 20 dollar scotch that taste better than this chemical smell that haunts you as u drink it almost like a burnt plastic for 2 3 the price i ll buy a glenlivet 12 so much better  bought this bottle on recommendation of a dear friend the medicinal flavor of the froig 10 for me is a ship stopper i m putting the bottle away in the box will trot it out only upon request different strokes for different folks but for me this is a disgusting dram yuck much prefer the lagavulin 16 or auchentoshan triple wood  a classic peaty malt which set the standard for island malts as opposed to highland it s main rival talisker is perhaps not quite so strong tasting but then laphroaig has mellowed in tone over the years since i first enjoyed a glass of quot tcp quot as it was then described it does take some getting used to if your grounding is in the sweet and sometimes bland speyside malts maybe work up from the likes of bowmore peaty but not so astringent of course when i fist started drinking laphroaig there were not many choices of malt whiskey so it was straight in at the deep end get used to it and some of the others are tastless by comparison i read that the quarter cask varieties have restored some of the old intensity of many years ago so i will have to try some if you love a malt with character then you should have a bottle in the cabinet but keep it away from any sweet martini friends as that would be a waste  after giving the bottle a rigorous shake it seemed to get much smokier but still not as intense as i remember weird just bought a bottle of this in upstate ny where did the smoke go have laph 10 before as well as ardbeg caol ila opened the bottle no smoke on the nose palate sweet vanilla and some medicinal but no smoke very disappointing someone please tell me this s result of cask variance  somehow the peatiness enhances the bitterness of the ipa and vice a versa  i am just starting to dabble into the single malts and i can understand that to some who have been drinking single malts that this may be the bees knees though from reading some of the reviews grammar may not be their forte i would have to agree with the worst reviews though as one who has been brewing for ten years now this scotch has almost a chemical smell unless you know what you are buying go with a macallan 12 year same price range as laphroaig 10 at my local retailer in oregon but the macallan is 12 is just wonderful at least to this scotch beginner ps a big ice sphere in the glass helps the laphroaig go down  i must agree with john campbell in that the taste of this whisky is greatly enhanced by the use of water i myself prefer ice since i like the first sip to be quot stingy quot i would also add that the taste had a bit of salty liquorice which is by the way very popular in finland and quite peaty i really enjoyed this one but it is something you have to learn to taste it is like you become good old friends and in the end you will be looking for your meeting in the blue darkness of the january nights of the north  not a bad one per se but with a really medicinal taste did not regret the purchase will not buy again  trust me i know better than you this is terrible and offensive  i ve tried a lot of whiskies and this is my all time favourite even compared to the more expensive laphroaigs powerful peat and iodine beautiful soft bitter sweet oak delicious flavoursome malt no room for improvement at all  pleasantly surprised by this 10 year old loved the smell  this is my all time favorite scotch whisky it comes on like a freight train and leaves like a summer breeze it definitely is not for the faint of heart best enjoyed with a little water preferably bottled water since the chemicals in tap water can destroy some of the flavors the water opens up the whisky and lets all the subtlety and nuance out note that drinking scotch neat can somewhat dull the tongue and actually detract from the experience enjoy this on a cold blustery night in front of a nice fire should be on anyone s list  though lag and ard are damn fine in their own right laphroiag is the gold standard by which to compare others in my opinion slainte mhor   a little water opens it up quite well a little too dense if you drink it neat the water spreads the peatiness and the other flavours come out of the woodwork to sing a nice long finish that doesn t taste smokey interesting  the one and only mixer one should grace any whiskey with is surely another whiskey  one finger and i was defeated i respect those who made it to the bottom of the glass  just so happens i love marmite got into malts about 2 years ago and i have returned to this malt on quite a few occasions i just can t help it she sucks me in with her peaty smokey iodine claws every time i ve tried quite a few islay malts and ardbeg 10 is my next purchase so when she arrives let the battle commence or in the famous words of harry hill which is the best peaty smokey islay out there there s only one way to find out fight  i m relatively new to the scotch game and this was my first real taste of an islay single malt it is markedly different than anything i ve tasted before i m guessing the smokiness is something that requires a little getting used to i will give this one another go in a few months it s been an hour since i enjoyed this scotch and i still taste nothing but smoke it s like someone had a bonfire in my mouth on a rainy day once the smoke dissipates i will enjoy a dram of macallan 12yr for quot dessert quot  i m a bar tender so while i have become quite familiar with my whiskies i m fairly new to the single malt game personally i m only 27 yrs old that being said i am absolutely in love with laphraoig 10 year the smoky nose round body and notes of vanilla and spice are just wonderful highly recommend  the only scotch i crave  i love its tastei don t think any single malt in it class is taste like this i love laphroaig 10 yr probably my top 2 or 3 favorite scotches i got one recently that was so different i actually called the store and told them that something was up either a switch or a 1 off or something tasted like a blend i went to another store miles away and got another bottle just to verify same thing much less smoke much more mellow is this just me 4 stars only because of the decades of fantastic whisky that laphroaig has produced  overrated would maybe use it in an irish coffee a waste of money  i was a chivas glenlivet drinker and i thought this was what a good scotch was all about i am here to tell that the laphroaig 10 and quarter cask although a bit pricey for the second has shown me what true scotch should taste like i agree with the above post that you will find everything that is good in life in a dram also i would drink many glasses of scotch at a sitting and find there is more drinking and appreciation in one or two glasses sipped slowly deffinitely the best  this 10 year old brings alot of flavors when added just a small teaspoon of water to open it up my first glass of this whisky tasted like a punch in the face from a burned fist i manned up and accepted this first punch the second glass the rest of the bottle oooh what a damn fine whisky this is certainly not for the beginner but i think for someone experienced this whisky brings the meaning of life to you  i am not a whiskey drinker but somebody offered this to me the other day and it blew my mind this must be the best thing in a bottle wonderful nose and impeccable flavors i am now a laphroag addict  this whiskey tastes like every good thing you ve ever experienced in life i couldn t taste the peat or smoke over the iodine taste as charles barkley would say quot it s turrible quot  just recently discovered this 10 year old didn t know anything could taste so good my taste buds may not be the best but i get the lovely peat smoke to start then it settles into oak and lastly i rub my tongue on the roof of my mouth and get sweet and varying fruit tastes  tastes like burnt wood with a burning after taste absolutely not recommended judge it on the 2nd glass didn t quite like it in the 1st glass it s got a different taste than most whiskys but this is light yet flavorful goes well after bbq meat marshmallows and chocolate if you have to mix it with coke then you are better off buying an everyday type jw black label or glenlivet as that s the sugary type and a little more intense i enjoy this with ice and a little soda water less than i would have when i open a glenlivet i can t take most whiskeys on the rocks s i finding too intense but this one would be possible on the 3rd round though  the laphroaig 10 year old is a must for any single malt fans and always a high standard very reasonable for the price  laphroaig 10 is a no holds barred unapologetic islay single malt it is by no means a good beginner s first single malt the best way to warm up to an islay is to drink cheap blended scotch known to be antiseptic j amp b passport cask strength bourbon or blended scotch known to be peaty johnnie walker red ballentine s you will start to taste less bandaid tcp phenol iodine and more towards salty breeze seawater shamrock dew walnut oil smoked scottish salmon brined roe deli pickles earthy peat cardamom oil cured olives old vanilla extinguished hickory campfire ash something malty limestone filtered water  just sat and read all these reviews very amusing and interesting i was introduced to laphroaig 10 by my lovely dad a serious single maltster and so it reminds me of him a real character and sitting on a headland in cornwall looking up at the stars and sipping for me there is no better drink for stirring the soul tastes divine too how many other women out there love it  i drink it i vomit how poetic  can t say i loved this stuff or hated it pretty mellowed out already when the barkeep slipped me this one took me camping fishing and on a long sea cruise in one glass woke up next morning ran down and bought a bottle of this brew terrific stuff  woooow there you seem to have left quite a few of these mike sorry your reviews weren t approved sooner they do have to be approved by the way but you re beginning to make us feel a bit like kevin it s scary a href http youtu be tbte2ggpt9a http youtu be tbte2ggpt9a a the chaps at master of malt a light clean whisky not oily at all with a huge tarry resinous burnt rope thc overtone so intense flavor but yet not bitter or burning or rough quite smooth in fact taste is a matter of opinion but take an opportunity to try this one if you like smoky whiskies at all or even if not well worth it  quot i spent a lot of money on this and was very dissapointed i usually take my dram with iron bru but this whisky absolutely killed the iron bru not recommended quot but sincere reviews are not very sad state of affairs mike stockholm sweden with this one you cant go wrong that is if you are a fan of islay whisky very good indeed a safe bet note to the person who rated this bottle with 1 2 a star you ought to stay away from laphroaig and all islay whisky tescos own brand whisky is probably more your style mike stockholm sweden i just got the first bottle of laphroig and was quite disappointed after the first glass two days later i came back for another it went down way better than i thought now with the bottle almost finished i can say that i am in love with this malt it looks like i will be heading to the shop tomorrow for another one what a complex peaty and smoky body what a looooong finish you can taste it in your mouth long after you finished your glass the scent is just amazing a lovely dram for an affordable price great  as a beginner i bought a bottle without expecting anything in particular well i heard it is peaty so far i ve explored different brands mainly from speyside so this came as a bit of a shock did i enjoy this though can t score it less than 10  bonfire with a hint of witch craft trail and a body of condensed exhaust gasses from the engine of a fishing vessel the best and most distinguished whisky i have ever tasted  i have been an avid scotch and whisky consumer for a very long time i grew up in a household that only drank dark liquor laphroaig by far has been the worst tasting scotch whisky for me it stunk of a scent i can never love i know everyone s taste is bias but now i know what gasoline tastes like  good islay malt but definitely not the best laphroaig has to offer  it s no different than drinking quot liquid smoke quot only buy if your trying to impress your bros  i am a big fan of smooth whisky whiskey because of that i am not a big fan of bourbon i have a preference toward irish whisky and to a lesser extent canadian whiskey i also can enjoy a good scotch whiskey and there are some great scotch out there but this is not one of them laphroaig is not smooth by any stretch of the imagination it has an overpowering quot dirty quot smoke flavor tastes like it was quot aged in someones quot well used and unclean quot bar b que grill i tried to quot kill quot the harshness by mixing it with quot coke quot no luck the smoke cut through the mix like a bad guitarist the fumes from this concoction actually irritated my eyes the aroma is actually pleasant to the nose but not to the tongue or the stomach there are some quot cheep quot offerings from canada that actually are smooth why pay this premium price for paint thinner grew up in texas drinking quot bourbon amp branch quot jack daniels and water amp had little experience with scotch until after i entered the service went into a liquor store in dallas late one new year s eve where i learned that they were sold out of almost everything popular the clerk recommended the laphroaig and even offered it to me at the cost of johnny walker saying that if i liked jack daniels black i d like laphroaig truer words were ne er spoke it was hard to find in the states for many years but always worth the search laphroaig and scrappy terriers are scotland s greatest exports  tasted this at my brother in laws he won it in a raffle this was a revelation for me absolutley the best drink in the world a real winner after first glass you only want more great with water let the flavours flow in your mouth superb  been sampling all the good single malts around this price range and laphroaig is the worst of them all the nose is very strong phenolic iodine disinfectant and the first sip is not much better the robust peaty secondary taste is not my favorite but if that was the finisher i would have been happy instead the final taste notes reminded me of burnt styrene plastic i ll finish the bottle but i ve had many better scotch whiskeys than this  i f you know what whisky is you have to drink this i t s magnificent and amazing i f you dont know what whisky is what are you doing here you must go to beer house  just vile have never tasted anything like it oh but wait yes i remember now reminds me of when i used to have a sore throat tcp just cant believe my daughter paid 33 pound for this trash its an insult to good whiskey laphroaig 10 is good to the nose decent body and decent finish i would rather buy talisker 10 however i would have to put down an extra 10 for the talisker all in all this is a good buy if you like your peat and it s a worth while buy  i love it straight or on the rocks it s texture is smooth and the flavor infuses with such smokey taste more women should try this instead of sugary high carb drinks only 40 calories per serving wine 120 coolers 253 numbers are approximations dont drink and drive peace  if you drink this with iron bru you are a philistine i love this whisky but would never drink it as a first round to begin a mellow whisky you have your favourite so no point me suggesting then a second of laphroaig beautiful contrast the difference of the laphroaig bursts but the memory of the other remains  i ve heard very good of this malt that s why i bought it though i will not do it again  smells like lagavulin 16 tastes like same then the finish hits you beware however as recomended above i will try with water and hope it smooths the finish i m a huge fan of smoke and peat but the medicinal quality of this scotch just killed it for me the iodine notes were overwhelming and i found myself grateful that it was being shared with me and not something i had bought if it s a flavor you dig more power to you but you better like that medicinal quality in your scotch  laphroaig is like drinking salty angel tears falling down onto the waves as the crash upon the jagged rocks below  i just cannot get over the hospital band aide smell taste cask strength 10 year old very disappointed wish i had googled it before buying i had an entire row of single malts to pick from maybe if i blend it half and half with dalwhinnie i can make a good blend out of it  please stop  una meraviglia  this is my go to scotch i do put 1 peice of ice to open it up a bit absolutely delicious makes me want to move to islay this whisky s peat level will tattoo its taste on your tongue and you will be perfectly happy to leave it there super strong smoky and unforgiving but not difficult to drink quite the opposite  brought a bottle of this for my dad on birth day he s a big fan of ardbeg and he loved it as for myself i like a more subtle whisky i just found that this whisky hits your nose and pallet with a very big bang over all in my opinion laphoaig is very bold in flavour and leaves nothing to imagination but that s just my opinion  i m a friend of laphroaig  i ve only started to enjoy single malts and scotch blends within the past year and i really like smoke and peat in my drinks so laphroaig 10yo is right up my alley my girlfriend said its a bit too medicinal for her but enjoyed it with a little water i enjoy it straight or with a splash of water so far of the 10 or so single malts i ve been able to try this has the most character of them all although a lot of people say this is very smoky i get a lot more peat and wouldnt mind a little more smoke i get the iodine medicinal flavor but definitely get hints of vanilla and wood in there while i still prefer lagavulin to this this is probably my second favorite single malt that i ve tried so far with the macallan in the high middle and glenlivet towards the bottom with tomatin at the very bottom i started with blends like johnnie walker black and still enjoy that as my every day drink but singles like laphroaig and lagavulin are my special treats  sometimes i prefer it straight sometimes with a kiss of water but the big bold peaty flavors the smoke salt and iodine the spices and lingering finish are warmly satisfying the only mix with a decent whisky is a few drops of pure water and a few drops is catalytic to this one probably not best for anyone new to single malts and certainly not for anyone who would mix whisky with irn bru dr pepper lucozade etc  purchased a bottle tried it threw it out tried it the next day threw it out tried it a third day i just simply can not handle this whiskey i would go so far as to say that it does not taste like any other whiskey i have had i went back to some of my standbys and well back to normal i just do not get this stuff maybe i got a bad bottle  i have such fond memories of this scotch every drop brings back memories it is fantastic especially when the weather is cold a strong wind is bringing the salt air in and you ve got a roaring wood fire going it is hardly possible to imagine anything better  ignore anyone who says they drink a single malt with iron bru if anything it goes alongside or with a little water and nothing else laphroaig make amazing whisky and although an acquired taste once tasted its never forgotten i personally love those medicinal notes over the peaty smoke that makes laphroig unique  my stepfather received a bottle for christmas and made sure everybody got to try it simply glorious starts peaty and ends smoky i m reminded of camping trips and cookouts i tend to prefer bourbons but this is easily the best whisky whiskey i ve tasted i have an open invitation to come back for more whenever i like he may end up regretting that  a top malt damp grass and hay on the nose alongside peat and a slight sweetness attributed to the malt barely but reminds one of biscuit or unrefined sugar alongside unsweetened vanilla pod ice cream the taste is peaty deliciously marked with iodine and quite juicy like drinking rain or seaweed from the islands slight notes of white pepper and a hint of salt which vanishes rather abruptly a great malt and a perfect predecessor to moving onto the stormy smokiness and peat of a talisker highly recommended  ignore reviews by people who can t even spell irn bru let alone know that you don t put it in single malt whisky blends yes but not single malt this is the quintessential islay whisky and full of peaty smoky goodness it is not for the faint hearted and i seriously doubt you can call yourself a lover of single malt if you don t enjoy this once in a while think amateur vs pro  not at all to my taste yes there was the smoke it is so famous for but more present were the smell of burnt plastic and the taste of aspirin and peat there is nothing pleasant about this whisky i know plenty of whisky drinkers who love it but it is just so foul to taste that i doubt i will ever order a dram again i can certainly appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into it so i can t give it anything under a 1 1 2 star rating but i wouldn t recommend this to somebody i actually liked  absolutely superb like the speyside malts and talisker but this is the best scotch tried the cask strength before and hated it but was given a bottle of 10 year old a few christmas s ago and have been buying it ever since for a bushmills green 10 yo malt man that s as good a complement as i can give absolutely superb like the speyside malts and talisker but this is the best scotch tried the cask strength before and hated it but was given a bottle of 10 year old a few christmas s ago and have been buying it ever since for a bushmills green 10 yo malt man that s as good a complement as i can give i for one love this malt true it is not for everyone it has a smoked iodine tang but without a shadow of a doubt it has to have one of the greatest characters of any malt available for me it is an absolute pleasure to drink and a dram i keep returning to time and time again i live on the firth of forth i pour myself a laphroaig and with the seagulls calling and the ships passing by i m in heaven only wish i could afford the 15 year old or even 25 year old  this scotch will knock your socks off at first i hated it then have a few more sips and by the time the bottle s gone you ll be wanting more the laphroaig 10 in my opinion is possibly one of the finest and most flavorful single malts out there and at a price which begs for multiple bottles to be stowed away for a rainy day which is precisely what i ve done the nose is like standing atop a hill overlooking the churning sea as a light drizzle of honey and lemon spatter against your anorak as you look up the strong peat and iodine coupled with the salty spray of the gorgeous waves remind you what it is like to be in islay country and carried on the back of the robust smoke comes just the tiniest hint of black pepper spices the honeyed palate covered in oak shavings and cardamon pods is truly a work of art the beautifully balanced greens give way to the most delightful peppery profile i have ever encountered the medium finish is just so ever slightly nutty with a dab of dare i say it dark chocolate and spice scrumptious  absolute beast of a whisky you just never get tired of that peat blast to start that long lasting finish along with lagavulin the best drinks i ve ever had  there are times when i really like this and there are times i don t care for it don t be put off if your first try seems bad laphroaig is specific for its medicinal tangy grassy taste but is in fact quite light bodied while the nose has quite a bit of charcoal campfire kind of smoke on the palate it s the peat that dominates  i absolutely love this fine dram it has such a fantastic flavour it is perfect for relaxing indoors on a cold night i ve bought it several times before i m definitely buying a bottle of this for christmas this and talisker are my two favourite whiskies  this whisky as mentioned before is either a love or hate relationship but rest assured if you like a whisky with tons of character then look no further smoke tcp and phenol rich and more peat than most peaty whiskies this is a tough whisky to love buy a sample if in dought  laphroaigs 10 yo is one of my most favorite whisky very strong sharp taste dominated by peat and smoke there are only two opinions to this malt either you love it or you hate it  i am getting hooked after few sips tasted very different in the beginning but the smoky touch is amazing  yeauch the taste of tcp medical liniment medical disinfectant is to ovepowering looking for a tramp to take this off my hands but they said no the first time i tried this it knocked me right out of my art deco armchair blimey i thought that s an odd taste it tastes like medicine i have no idea what the smoke of burning peat tastes like but those above who liken laphroaig to tcp have it about spot on for 12 hours following my initial tasting i doubted i d spent my money wisely however after 24 hours i was really hankering for another glass of the stuff its taste is very distinctive and now i am 100 hooked on it to my palate it tastes of damp soil suspended in tcp and it s by far my favourite whisky when i do want a change i opt for the glenlivet which has a nice malty taste which contrasts well with the laphroaig i give a toast to the smell of wet tweed and the taste of laphroaig  this is a fantastic drink for those who have seen hell and have returned or have seen heaven and miss it the complexity and tenacity of this drink are not to be muddled with any other flavor the only thing i can suggest is to take an icicle and stir it a few times to help cool the peat fires that rage forever in this drink enjoy the drink don t be a wuss  this is a fantastic drink for those who have seen hell and have returned or have seen heaven and miss it the complexity and tenacity of this

don t be a wuss  i m new to whiskey and alcohol in general looking to expand my tastes but this was just too much far too much if you are an islay man then it may be for you but to a newbie it will just put you off the wonderful world of scotch but i m still young and can drink a scotch older than me with a huge bank balance so maybe i ll come back to it again maybe which is great if that s your thing a must try for anyone interested in learning to taste scotch it deserves a lot of credit for becoming the synonym for extreme islay flavors it s at worst a memorable experience and at best your new favorite whisky  i m a real fan of islay and laphroaig is one of the best in my opinion but for this one specifically price is a bit higher for what it is in itself recommended whisky anyway  any islay single malt is an acquired taste you either love or hate its unique taste my recommendation is to try before you buy but if like me you love the stuff you ll rarely drink the highland whisky in preference  the 10 year old is only for people who like the smokey peat flavor like me recently the peatiness has been toned down i noticed which is a shame many people would also like the quarter cask more expensive much less smokey just a hint and much smoother one of the finest single malts you ll find and about adding water soda irn bru or whatever its simple do whatever testes best to you remember the best tasting whiskey is the one that tastes the best to you simple isnt it regardsgeorge menon goa do not spoil this with ice just drink as it is sit back close your eyes and dream of the salt sea waves seagulls and wooden boats  i sampled several scotches at my local bar one drunken night and i woke up dreaming about laphroaig i no more found this whiskey than it found me this is the exact taste i have been looking for from whiskey i have tried many other whiskeys since and none have surpassed the bar set by laphroaig  add one tablespoon to every 1 2 pint of maggot you ll bag up danny fairbrass whispered this into my ear one night and i ve never looked back and i ve healed up nicely too  i loved that hamster he made a blinding cup of tea  very good and great value for money but the laphroaig quarter cask is even better  this is a man s scotch there is nothing delicate about it it is so flavorful and smokey each sip is like getting hit in the mouth with a half burnt campfire log i love it this 10 year old topps my list for unwinding in the evening a little goes a long way if you plan on drinking half a bottle during a sitting buy something else i find this to be their best offering and will always keep a spare bottle in my inventory  when the guy told me it was a very smoky flavor i wish he had said it tastes just like smoke big difference also the chloroseptic taste and quality numbed my tongue to the point i could finish it so that s a plus not a big fan at this point but i will definitely try it as recommended with a teaspoon of water  i use this with drambuie and a slight bit of water goes great scotch with lucozade iron bru isnt that illegal  excellent taste smok and persistent  what a flavour if hvent tasted thee whiskey u hvent tasted whiskey it has a smooth nd refleshing flavour its goes well with well barbequed porks ribs l am enjoing it zimbabwe woye so smokey you surely have to be a child to enjoy this gimmick i can only taste smoke and as someone mentioned tcp i can t take this kind of pain on my tastebuds i m just not strong enough to stick it out and detect any subtleties after the horrid taste sorry i m sure people like it somewhere somehow all the best to you i won t keep any from you you lucky things  i am surprised and very disappointed at the strong taste and smell of tcp that this whiskey has on offer i put some that i had in a glass and put it in the fridge for my husband to taste and it stank the whole fridge out i have never had whiskey tasting like that in my life till now its terrible  or its just a peaty iodiney alcoholic mess of a whisky which is absolutely delightful and thankfully an affordable standard  i usually mix my whisky with banana yop however this malt totally dominated the milkshake s subtle creamy taste and the resulting mix curdled somewhat and therefore i cannot recommend it  has anyone heard that decanting this malt enhances the flavour and removes the tcp taste  stick to the soft drinks wee man whisky ain t for you thank you for your kind comments re our beloved malt however please note when attempting sarcasm and in particular when slating others intellect please utilise a decent dictionary to spell words as you have spelt most words incorrectly incl whisky whiskie laphroaig laphroaigh amoeba ameboa and even intelligence intelliegence spell check is also free regards tis true laphroaig spoiled my tap water totaly and non of the water s subtelities were present anymore anyone looking for something special i recommend any sugar rich cordial carefully mixed in to tapwater and kept in dark and cool place overnight before consumption it s irn bru this sounds like just what i m looking for for my work mates retirement present but does anyone knoe if it comes in that tube thingy next to the bottle in the picture  sorry that should ve been a 10  this one is actually one of the best i ve ever tasted this is a smoky salty sweety and seaweedy islay malt a bit too sweet for my taste though to commentator below you should stay away with single malts and drink only iron bru  instead of irn bru or lucozade do what the distillery recommend add no more than a teaspoon of plain water to your dram and taste the flavour explosion  great islay whiskey but surely not for the average people who is used to blended whiskeys  prefer to mix mine with lucozade however i found this dram spoilt my lucozade somewhat and therefore cannot recommend it  tiene un sabor muy característico todos los de islay tienen un sabor humo muy recomendable mezclar con un poco de agua  the jury is still out on this one for me i am very new to whisky and have enjoyed eventually a bottle of aberlour 10 yr old and a glen farclas 12 yr old this is very different smoke smoke and smoke medicinal is a good description i ll stick with it though and will report on my findings what a chore i just love the amazing variety that whisky has to offer makes beer look bland  how funny that someone ruined a divine peaty whisky with iron bru this should be taken with an ice cube or a splash of water picked up a couple of these the other day on a whim the have a us government tax stamp on them truly amazing dram you can find green apple tartness in this that i do not find as much in the current release wonderful bottle for the money  for those who like the flavor of iodine as well as a thick sweetness with ravenous smoke this one is for you i like mine a tad more subtle if highland park is a tap on the shoulder this one is a open handed slap on a cold day not my thing but glad they make it variety the spice of life laphroaigh is absolutely beautiful just beautiful  must say its much cheaper then talisker but taste very good i would like to recomend this one for those who like it smokey  i tried laphroaigh for the first time at a wedding and considering i don t drink whiskie and was told it has an aquired taste well what can i say laphroaigh was absolutely beautiful i savoured every drop and i can t wait to get a bottle or two i instantly loved this whiskie and anyone who slates this has the i q of an ameboa for those too simple to understand a ameboa is a single cell creature with little or no intelliegence laphroaigh is on my shopping list laphroaig and ardbeg this is the heaven  not recommended laphroaigh is the one of the best whiskies of the world if anyone have a problem with a taste just don t drink it in my opinion it is one of the best whiskies i ve ever taste especially i like the aftertaste which i discoverded is a elderflower anybody have a same experience  a truly delicious islay scotch love the peaty smoke and the medicinal aspect a very close second to lagavulin 16 a dram that can be enjoyed with a fine cigar and good company to warm a cold winter night in australia  i think its a really unique single malt with a taste of its own i love it and would recommend it any day  woefully underpriced don t tell laphroaig that this is bar none one of my favorite all time whisky s beats the ardbeg 10 hands down in my estimation as it is much thicker on the tongue and has much more depth if you want an easier dram but still love peat go with the ardbeg but it ll cost you a fair amount more as for mixing only add about 4 drops of water if you want to mix something else with your scotch go with johnny walker red or a lesser scotch mixing something other than water with laphroaig is a travesty  im just not a peaty fan respect to the different flavour though smells like a hospital ward and tastes like one too but once you get into peat laphroaig has no rivals a very special dram  only share your thaughts about things you know leave the rest to ppl who knows  an absolutely delicious whiskey enjoyed a ribeye steak and laphroaig straight   i spent a lot of money on this and was very dissapointed i usually take my dram with iron bru but this whisky absolutely killed the iron bru not recommended this guy is clearly a beer drinker this whisky is the best one in terms of quality price if you smoky flavored  i assume the first review is meant to be a joke lagavulin 16 probably has a more complex flavour than this and it s much better at cask strength what isn t but there s no topping the medicinal peat reek of laphroaig this is a lovely drop  anyone who puts any mixer into a single malt needs to be shipped off to an island somewhere far away insulting this peice of peatylicous perfection is a crime my favourite islay it s a beautiful dram bonfire peaty smoky sweet medicinal delicious and distinguished  i love laphroaig it has such a different flavour to other malts anyone who puts iorn bru into single malt whisky is a 100 fool full stop maybe the auther should stick to a few cans of tennents or a nice bottle of buckfast pay no mind to the above comments as laphroaig is a very fine whisky and worth every penny  the review above is an insult to this whisky lovely peaty stuff  the review above is an insult to this whisky lovely peaty stuff  i spent a lot of money on this and was very dissapointed i usually take my dram with iron bru but this whisky absolutely killed the iron bru not recommended 
2130.0, a great single malt i received a bottle for my 61st birthday enjoyed every dram 5 star rating gerald brown  this is a creamy sweet whisky and to me it evokes oranges orange blossom and orange creamsicle not overwhelmingly citrus or of orange zest but that is the suggestion it is delicious i don 39 t get much barrel toast briskness or heat not stiff very supple  after many years of enjoying whisky both blended and malts it 39 s this one i return to time after time i am on a limited budget and while occasionally i will treat myself to a more expensive bottle of something different this is my all time favourite  good nose and palate is spoiled by an over spicy finish i sort of begrudgingly bought a bottle of this the other day and i was more than pleasantly surprised well defined and straightforward flavours with an excellent balance i ve found myself returning to it instead of other malts in my collection an absolutely lovely dram of whisky and will always make room for it  undeniable quality here i have tasted lighter whiskies than this so i wouldn 39 t characterize it as quot light quot i found that adding water enhanced this when i nosed it i really got a lot of alcohol and not so many of the notes i got orange and honey mostly the finish is very pleasant and refined a good starter single malt unspectacular but of high quality  it feels like a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away that i had my first glenmo as a father s day present from my son still today i believe that it holds up as a great whisky on it s own but also as the absolute starting point of a journey into glenmo s very diverse portfolio this is the base juice for their whiskies and it really does define the taste of glenmo i have tasted a lot of their juice and still this one is quite something not amazing just damn good if you 39 ve not had glenmorangie for a while it 39 s like meeting up with an old friend you don 39 t realise how much you welcome it 39 s company it 39 s a delightfully smooth malt that leaves a lovely sweet taste and one that deserves many repeat visits outstanding for the price i couldn t drink the first bottle of talisker i was given now i love it but this stuff goes down easy light and a bit honey sweet it s a great starter if you re looking to into malt whisky always have a bottle knocking around smoother version of glenlivet founders reserve  the packaging is probably the best thing about this malt don t get me wrong it s not a bad whisky but it s nothing special for its price and age there s dozens of readily available alternatives which present better value it has some character and isn t harsh but it s not memorable worth a buy under 163 25 but even then there s more bang for your buck to be had elsewhere  a very smooth 10 year old scotch an gentle sweet citrus on the nose with more subtle sweetness on the palate as has been mentioned before almost a banana hint smooth finish with very little harshness very good for this price point  this is definitely the nicest 10 year old whiskey i 39 ve had its very smooth and has a rich fruity flavour tastes older that 10 its a very reasonable price aswell definitely recommend trying this one 128076  some of the other reviews are a bit harsh when comparing it to older or more expensive whiskies i think for its age and price point it ticks all the boxes it 39 s a classic and very nice introduction to scotch  especially as other classic big names glenfiddich lagavulin laphroaig have experienced batch varation and decline in overall quality glenmorangie is rock steady the value for money is unparalelled for a mass produced approachable brand the quality has not been compromised bravo  best of the cheap end of decent single malts smooth and flavoursome with hints of citrus like orange peel and sweetness like banana  very smooth 10 yr old i 39 ll give it a 5 star but i prefer talisker 10 yr old for its smokey taste i personally prefer  i 39 ve had before and it was okay but tonight not so not much character i wish i could return  recommend by a scotsman who was stood next to me after i was debating which one to try next smooth warm and balanced nose sweet fruits spices and orange palate vanilla boiled sweets finish warm long malt  was expecting to enjoy as i 39 ve made my way through some of glenmorangie 39 s other bottles it 39 s very smooth no burn creamy and thick mouthfeel but the flavour was just a mess to me was dry overly herbal with very little in the way of sweetness or malt character  don 39 t drink but inherited my dad 39 s whisky collection in 2003 i 39 ve used several bottles to soak fruit when making rich fruit cakes for his grandchildrens 18th 21st engagements weddings etc i recently gifted a 20 year old laphroaig to a friend for helping us with some decorating and he refused it saying it was too much so i started investigating and it seems i have baked my way through hundreds of pounds worth of whisky this christmas all the family are getting a bottle of whisky and being asked to toast dad on christmas eve and enjoy the rest of the bottle throughout 2021 i have 4 glenmorangie 10year so just checking value so i know to gift the more expensive bottles to those who drink whisky and might appreciate them more i 39 m giving this 5 even though i don 39 t drink because dad had a cupboard full and he did know his whisky 129347 128522  fantastic whisky real whisky when you can get this on offer at 163 26 a bottle nothing else compares if you don 39 t love this you don 39 t love whisky proper no negatives  love the finish got me buzzed in no time sneaks up on you after a while prefer it to the gold label or other drams in the price range surprisingly on sale at the dubai duty free picked up a few i liked this less than expected which is weird but compared to the other sweet scotches i had at the time this felt hot and didn t stand up as well with ice pretty fruity decent malted barley esters but overall a disappointment i ll have to try again someday  a bit disappointing has a good nose but the finish is non existent compared to other supermarket staples such as bowmore 12 and aberlour 12 this is bland usually always on offer so don 39 t feel robbed at least at 163 26 quite honestly i don 39 t get the negative reviews i do not claim to be a single malt connaisseur but i have drunk loads of good whiskeys bushmills 16 year and black bush glenlivet lagavulin balvenie 16 laphroaig 10 12 and 16 glenkinchie 12 aberlour 12 and glenmorangie sherry cask the lasanta being a few of my favourites but the go to whiskey the desert island whiskey for me is the glenmorangie original sweet but never too sweet fruite but never too fruity silky smooth woody with a hint of smoke and vanilla heavenly just heavenly tesco has it on offer for 26 quid and i bought 4 of them  this is a solid drink although i find that the 14 year glenmorangie is just head and shoulders above this stuff  i am no great whisky connoisseur but i know a good spirit and this one is not based on the favourable reviews i was expecting whisky as it should be smooth with complex flavours and good body glenmorangie fails on all counts it 39 s unpleasantly sharp like cheap alcohol very light bodied to the point of tasting thin and regarding complex flavours well forget about it even if they are there they are beaten by the sharpness of it good spirit should never burn in your mouth and throat and this one does i paid 26 pounds for it on a special offer and it 39 s not worth even that i will use it for eggnog and for christmas pudding as i don 39 t find it good enough to drink neat and will never buy another bottle again if you want a good bottle for around 30 40pounds i totally advise highland harvest which is really nice but again even famous grouse is far better than glenmorangie i am annoyed that i bought it this bottle is both first and definitely the last one never again  i am no novice to the scotch world but no expert either i got the glenmorangie for a deal at 30 and some change i have been on a laphroaig 10 kick as my go to for a little while and decided to give this 10 a try my initial assessment was disappointment but then i decided to assess it without comparing i am glad i did because my stubbornness would have kept me from enjoying a really good scotch i do put some cool water in it to get it down to around 38 from 43 and that also opens it up a bit i would definitely buy this again even at a regular price  i snapped a bottle at a terrific price just for the sake of it and approached it with an open mind i 39 m more into wood peat and smoke when i peak consiously but i have to say this one was a very nice surprise pale light sweet yet complex direct and refreshing awesome stuff this one and lasanta are at the top of my list for a daily whisky  good value for money  umm for 40 maybe decent certainly not hard to drink reminds me of tomatin 39 s 12 year for same price or perhaps a bit less slight taste of grain alcohol overall i like the stuff but a lot of strong competition in that price range  a fantastic malt at a very good price even my wife thought it better than most she doesn 39 t drink whisky just a touch of water or a cube of ice perfect the glenmorangie 10 year old original is quite simply the standard that all other single malt scotch whiskies should be compared other than islay for obvious reasons much better than many much more expensive whiskies and quite simply it is delicious smooth creamy and sweet i keep trying others there are many fabulous scotch whiskies but i always return to my trusty favourite it never fails to deliver  love it my quot go to quot whisky always smooth and consistent  as you pointed out a go to dram for even the most discerning of malt drinkers personally i am never disappointed when i taste it and in my opinion it is far superior to many supposedly quot better quot and certainly more expensive whiskies  glenmorangie is on the shelves of every single bar in scotland for a reason when you 39 re tired of going on about smoke and peat and searching out those ultra rare super expensive drams from distilleries which were destroyed by the red coats you have always been able to rely on glenmorangie to bring you down to earth with an quot aaahhh quot it 39 s just really nice sweet but not too sweet smooth buttery goodness and i am happy to report that unlike many whiskies which have been treated shamefully and i believe that the scottish government should launch an official inquiry into this criminal behaviour glenmorangie is still very good the 18 year old is just beautiful but don 39 t look down your nose at the 10  very nice smooth in my opinion the best in its price range i enjoy a couple ounces over ice every night  very nice in the nose many fruits but then only young and sweet maybe some vanillafor the money not bad   quot g 39 morangie 10 is a lovely dram easy enough and enjoyable for anyone new to single malts yet complex enough too for those more experienced who can pick out the different tastes and layers simple and complex yep depends who 39 s drinking it not overly complex but enough to be interesting always nice fruity malty floral oakey and i find a little dry grassy or hay 39 ish could be the malty oakey but anyway to the dude that talking about peat smoke and laphrounge are you talking about laphroaig please there is not a balance of peat smoke in gm 10 there is no peat smoke in gm10 you are just tasting oak your limited kentucky bourbon palette is only used to vanilla toffee molasses and sugar honey what you 39 re misinterpreting as peat is oak my friend there are some great bourbons but welcome to the world of whisky single malts several more layers of complexity yes laphroaig does have peat lots of it amp will take some getting used to maybe a long time till you get there but when you do enjoy the sweetness and honey under the smoke  i am new to whiskey and tried dozens am i wrong in thinking this is the archetypal whiskey it 39 s a beautiful wee dram throughly enjoyed this whiskey was really delicious i go for this sort of price range and this is the best that i have tried  like many reviewers here glenmorangie was the whisky that got me into whisky after visiting the distillery on a holiday in scotland and spending far to much in the shop on bottles of the classic 10 year old quinta ruban and the tain i took them back to our digs and quickly the love of whisky started for that reason glenmorangie deserves full stars ive tried to like the whisky in the past and failed but never caught the bug until i tried this the classic is none offensive clean easy to drink and just lovely i always have a bottle in and it delivers every time thankfully there 39 s a bottle in most pubs in the whisky section next to the hideous offerings like haig club ignore the whisky snobs this is a great dram  to the guy that wrote this taste like ballentines finest dude i got that got b 39 s finest for xmas and it taste like acidic burnt wood and my stomach hurts from just a small bit of it you cannot compare that crappy ass shit to to glenmorangie 10 its good scotch smooth nice complexities i just dont dig the apricot note but its not bad i like it more as i go very very nice my go to for a good palatable single malt at a reasonable price i am not good with peaty smoky island malts so this is perfect yum yum gimme some  in the old days this delightful approachable smw would be called a panty remover now a days it is called a date enhancer have always respected the tighty from tain i received the glenmorangie gift set from my son in law for christmas we opened the two small bottles of 12 year old first 10 years in american oak and 2 years in oloroso casks porto casks i love cross barreling beers wines and whiskeys so i couldn 39 t wait both were very nice to drink indeed finishing in the fortified wine barrels adds a very subtle fruit note that i totally enjoy then we drank a couple drams of the 10 year old i mostly drink blended whiskeys as single malts are generally loaded with 39 character 39 and some have taken getting used to for my kentucky bourbon palette i tend to seek balance in my whiskeys and beers and glenmorangie seems to have found that delicate mix of malt peat and oak the smokiness of the peat was pleasant not overbearing laphrounge took some getting used to the tannins lended good leathery vanilla notes that followed through the finish the overall balance is correct with the peat smoke gently leading the way followed by oak vanilla without any bite  this scotch in many ways supplies the yardstick by which i judge malt whisky it is classically highland with some wood notes and smooth entry with a leather finish if you want to know if you like malt whisky buy this one first explore from there  i am not a fan of this malt i wouldn 39 t turn it down as a gift but i would never give it as one  i get a musty smell of paint old wood and damp leather shoes bit of apple mixed in on tasting rather nice  this is my second time trying glenmorangie 10 and both times i have hated it i just do not get the high marks most people give it first of all at 43 abv it is too strong for such a weak bodied whisky second it has a harsh gasoline flavor i like all kinds of scotches from blends to islay stuff but i cannot stomach this it is like rotgut american bourbon i would not take a bottle as a gift for anyone new to single malts do not start with this one go with glenlivet which is about the same price at lest here in the usa  glenmorangie is one of those drams that many people move on from in search of exotic liquors tangy smokey islay malts rare bourbons aged rums like the ubiquitous fender telecaster it is shunned by the inexperienced as limited or for beginner s i know i made the same mistake why have something every single pub in scotland has when you can have a scapa until recently i had drunk glenmorangie a handful of times in my gt 30 year whisky career after drinking practically every single malt whisky i could find or afford i returned to the one i probably ordered first in my life i probably put ice in it the 18 year old is like coming home to your favourite meal the ten is absolutely straightforward it is a little sweet a little bitter with a slightly buttery consistency there is nothing about it that stands out particularly but it does everything it needs to no show no unique selling point just perfectly decent single malt whisky that you can drink anytime and not be disappointed with  initially this tastes too much alcohol and spicy however it was very surprising that after a while more than anything else there is very strong lovely dried date aroma you can smell anybody will be able to smell it in an empty bottle of this date is a desert fruit how can something made of grain in a wet and cold place can produce exact same aroma is amazing high quality liquor that gives you drunken feeling but does not give you hang over headache the best whiskey i ever had  ok i have been thinking this one over for a while and i believe i got it nose sweet navel oranges or mandarin orange palate fresh squeezed orange juice with a touch of honey thats it thats the deal simplistic orange beauty a delight  the prince of 10 year old malts no explanation of this whiskey would be complete without a little backstory my obsession with scotch began completely by accident i had given a friend of mine 20 to pick up a bottle of e amp j brandy but he thought i said quot j amp b quot so began a 13 year love affair with the finest spirit known to man since then my palate has grown more sophisticated every year around the holidays i share that love of good spirits with my family in the form of this classic highland single malt a nice rich nose of honeydew melon almonds and citrus is accompanied by a lovely and creamy amber appearance the taste is difficult to describe precisely because it changes so much depending on how you drink it if you sip it with ice the fruit and honey is very apparent if you let it warm up a little more richness like caramel and vanilla toffee starts to emerge if you really swallow deep the dark smokiness characteristic of good single malt makes a big appearance it 39 s just fabulous whiskey for the price try it if you have a chance  smooth amp delicate  nothing lacks this whisky one of the best single malt nothing specially nice about this glenmorangie as several have stated already it is not bad i certainly wouldn 39 t throw it down the sink but is too caramel sweet cloy and lacking in character i haven 39 t bought any of the glenmorangies for many years but the 10 year old original that i remember was a pale tangy delecate mineral whisky that was really nice will not buy this one again but may try some of the other glenmorangie whiskies  good whiskey i wouldn 39 t take reviews from americans seriously they generally don 39 t know what they talking about  light fruity and notes of honey  a gorgeous easy drinking smooth whisky in my top 5 i like almost all single malt scotches this is the worst tasting one i ve ever experienced it is a mixture of cloying sweetness and nasty bitterness the sweetness bitterness is i suspect related to the caramel used to colour this product in addition there is way too much wood giving the whisky a dull stewed quality i recall the 80 s early 90 s when the standard glenmorangie had a beautifully sharp fresh and focussed flavour profile it did a wonderful magic trick in the glass where an initial sharp metallic element disappeared leaving a sumptuous creaminess and delicate florals then the company changed the blending regime adding way to many older casks thereby completely destroying the signature aroma and taste of this once classic dram the company admitted its mistake but it never got back to its spectacular form  too young too sweet too watered down wish i wouldn t have bought a bottle as it was hard to finish i got very tired of the taste about half way through out of the base glens this is by far the worst  this is my favorite among the 39 glens 39 livet fiddich and morangie all quality 39 staples 39 while often this is priced in the mid 40 39 sus i can occasionally grab them up for 30 this is 43 in us and methinks surprisingly good and consistently so just a touch more complex than the other 39 glens 39 in my opinion embracing its position at the very top of my cheap er daily tipples i often want something different than glenmorangie 10 however i rest more easily knowing that i always have this one available to fall back upon a great base line palette for glenmorangie 39 s 12 year cask finishes port sherry and sauternes all of which are even more interesting i really really like this one simply for what it is  i first purchased this malt in 1973 it was my first malt and i found the complexity very appealing it was smooth with a variety of flavours that i cannot recall i was sufficiently pleased with this bottle to purchase another for hogmanay two years later and was very disappointed in the rough finish it reminded me of an inexpensive blended whisky well i am looking forward to 2019 and having read the reviews will try this malt yet again for hogmanay rating based on first memory here 39 s hoping  i 39 ve been drinking scotch for twelve years now and single malts for about half that time several brands are cheaper but i don 39 t even consider them anymore this finds its way into my cart every time it 39 s on the shelf at the local spirits shop fine nose rich fruity taste smooth and creamy mouthfeel very pleasant buzz with no lingering after effects this always punches above its weight against more expensive whiskeys there must be some magic in those tall stills because this stuff is better than the numbers say it should be i love it  meh taste very similar to ballantines finest wont buy again if you want to save money and have a pretty similar whisky buy ballantines finest  i was first introduced to single malt scotch in the 1990 39 s and have tried many this has become my quot go to quot scotch as i travel often and most decent bars carry it smoother than a macallan or a glenfiddich  as a newbie to the world of whiskey it 39 s hard to rate as this is my first bottle i was advised to start with this and i am happy i did i found it easy to drink no harshness or burn the slight spicy taste and smoothness kept me going back for more brilliant whiskey to start your journey on nothing special probably a beginners scotch i prefer more smoke i love talisker  a nice 39 dram after work 39 everyday whisky no harshness no peat or smoke easy to drink and a great starter to recommend to a novice drinker quite complex with each sip malt and apple on the nose with citrus and some firey zing that gives way to fruity tastes until the cream and toffee finishes the plethora of flavours no harshness but a lot to enjoy which could easily go down a bit too quick if you don 39 t restrain your sips certainly not an islay so if your one for a smokey kick like bowmore or lagavulin then this isn 39 t for you more of a glenlivet founders reserve but with more complex quality worth a purchase especially at the price for what it is nice whisky  a palate of citrus peat amp vanilla notes perfectly balanced this is an incredible dram at any price but the msrp makes it a scotch that s hard to pass up  very nice unoffensive light this is how proper scotch single malt should taste like take a note glenlivet  peat and vanilla smoke but in perfect harmony if you re looking for something that 39 s not going to disappoint this is it it 39 s a great well rounded scotch smooth and with enough complexity to satisfy the more sophisticated as far as age goes you 39 d think the 10 is a typo it 39 s better than a lot of 12 and 15 year old whiskeys  primarily citrus slightly peachy aroma very pleasant vanilla on the palate initially then fruit flavours with a tiny hint of spice very very smooth perhaps more so than glenfiddich 12 slight finish of peach verdict a classic great for beginners and seasoned drinkers alike it 39 s not complex but quite pleasant and far from boring this is not the best but it 39 s damn close and well worth the money  heavy fruit on the nose smooth and thick on the palate long smooth vanilla and fruit aftertaste it 39 s a good as it ever was one of the up front single malts in the liquor cabinet very nice creamy good mouth feel nice finish i don 39 t think i have ever reviewed this particular whisky even though this is actually where my obsession with the stuff began this is the very first single malt i ever bought and i loved it not fruity like glenlivet and fiddich 12 yrs more honey vanilla oak even slightly floral one of the best if not the best examples of the highland style and considering this is their entry level just shows you how great glenmorangie really is always welcome in my collection the sugarbear not quite as creamy as higher priced 12yr old such as macallan but very drinkable for 10yr single malt the taste is there but the nose is practically non existent i had a bottle before this one that was far superior in every way especially the nose and finish but also the color it should be a brilliant orangish gold the bad batch is a much lighter gold also the alcohol quality was a step below the last one and glenmo already has a tendency to produce hangovers even in the higher quality 12 year bottles of lasanta and qr nectar d or is an exception to this and i haven t tried the 18 signet or older scotches yet a double gave me a light hangover i ve relegated this bottle to a one shot limit or as a finisher after a couple shots of better scotch i picked up another gift pack bottle with a glenmorangie glass and a shot of lasanta hopefully that bottle will redeem the original with the fine lasanta and okay glass making up for the last s failure the rough bottle was from 06 02 2017 marked l67403 17001439 avoid a similar bottle if at all possible since it is a generously rated 3 stars at best whereas my previous experience with glenmorangie was a 4 star value buy this bad batch is similar in quality to speyburn 10 whereas i expect glenmorangie 10 to be competing with glenfiddich 12 macallan 12 and glenlivet 12 are the two bottles i make sure to keep stocked with balvenie rising up the charts lasanta is pretty damn good but macallan is better qr is good but not a regular for my palate nd is excellent  i don 39 t know scotch but i know what i like one taste o this angel 39 s nectar and you will be sold we should invade the country and turn the distillery into a church war would end over night  never thought of buying it until it appeared on sale at tesco for 163 26 so had to do it wow what a tasty dram this is i 39 ve done a couple of back to back tastings against ancnoc 12 and dalwhinnie 15 and glenfarclas 12 and to my taste buds this wins lots more going on the palate than the others really nice depth to it and great finish i 39 ll have to buy another bottle whilst on sale and think more seriously about lasanta  my first try of single malt was a 3 pack from costco glenmo 10 quinta ruban port finish and lasanta sherry finish despite being a complete newbie i fell in love with single malts and whisky in general i do have various more interesting malts that i paid more money for and have more flavor and complexity but glenmo 10 to my palate remains among the most complex young malts thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying i like to keep a spare bottle i 39 ll often drink it when i can 39 t decide what else i crave it 39 s 43 here in the us  fairly new to the scotch world have about 30 bottles and bought the 18 yo of this before buying this bottle i enjoy it many of the same qualities at a third of the price drinking side by side to the 18 i can 39 t say you are justified in spending the extra 60 i am sure some of the nuances of the 18yo are lost on me as i develop a palate plan to always have a bottle of this on the shelf its amazing to me what a tall still can produce  light floral citrus one of the better highlands wins in the long run really well made but i 39 m affraid if one compare scotlands whiskies to the japanese whiskies few of scotlands whiskies will or would survive  very good quality price ratio very smooth pleasant to taste never been a whisky drinker always went for the havana rum after trying alot of whisky 39 s none compare to this it 39 s not too sweet on the palette but it has the perfect balance of flavours and sweetness perfect for any occasion highly recommend as a number one whisky  my favourite whisky of all time  so many better at the price no outstanding features so back to glen moray for the daily dram  exceptional value much tastier than others in the price range such as glenlivet and glenfiddich also higher in alcohol at 43 percent so by far a better deal i 39 ve tasted many more expensive single malts but always come back to glenmorangie original it 39 s a baseline whisky one to measure all others by  great whiskey for the price nice taste and after taste especially for a bourbon lover  there 39 s nothing bad about this whisky it 39 s pleasant it 39 s light and floral i 39 d never complain about drinking it but compared to something like an old pulteney 12 i 39 m sorry to say but it 39 s kind of boring if i want a honey ish floral whiskey i 39 ll probably go for a lowland glenkinchie 12 instead  my favorite whiskey ever i tried a lot and still couldn 39 t find better mild fruity taste and aftertaste charming smell and pleasant smoothness this is my persaption of this heavenly beverage nothing extraordinary but very pleasant for the budget  great whiskey for the price nice taste and after taste especially for a bourbon lover i think it lacks the complexity of the matured whiskeys but i love it and would buy it again and again  am also find this is batter than jony walker whisky i think very well this is for injoy l r godara bagla hisar haryana citrus punch on the nose with a very malty palate like digestive biscuits smooooooooth smooth finish great all round refreshing classic could drink anytime  started with this and it has always been my go to or default whiskey the burn most describe is the spicy finish i love so much its so smooth yet flavorful that i literally detect different flavors depending on how much i sip at a time barely on my lips gives me the hint of spice and honey alittle more on my tongue and i taste vanilla and peach a fuller mouth and i rtaste the stronger qualities single malts are known for oh and make sure to swallow slow as other flavors are unlocked in the back of my mouth with delicious foloow through when it finally settles in the back of my throat the warmth as it trickles down to my belly is just the comforting icing on this cake of a whiskey  i am not familiar with what a good dram is i am not sure how to drink it so i mix it with water and ice i would say better than the gray grouse and johnny walker i am not sure it is better than dewars but what the hell do i know  great sm scotch for the money  syrup peaches apricots citrus balanced best 39 more affordable 39 scotch i 39 ve had repeat customer rated 5 star because of qualtiy vs price this entry level bottling carries such sophistication and complexity for a spirit driven young malt i got hold of a 43 abv fortunately and was honestly blown away by what i was tasting at that age and price point  my favourite of all the 10 year old whiskeys smooth but complex taste easy to drink great on its on with ice or just a splash of water a grade all rounder  good one of the best i 39 ve ever had very palatable for people new to drinking single malt scotch  same with jack daniels i cannot get my head around why this is so popular it 39 s not a bad drink but distinctly average no where near deserving it 39 s popularity i will be generous and give it 2 1 2  without doubt one of the best whiskies on the market after a good run with the entry level single malt scotchs 39 i found this to be the best by far i feel it 39 s important for ppl to identify how they drink their scotch as we are two different palates and the scotch itself will taste differently i myself drink mine on the rocks i found this 10 year to have much more flavor then others in the category with none of the burn the low reviewers experienced it 39 s very fruity with citrus and vanilla coming through the strongest it had a nice finish that was smooth and stayed around just long enough for the price you can 39 t go wrong with this one  wow is all i have to say about this fantastic single it was a very welcomed surprise when i first tried it and easy very easy to drink a prefect whiskey to share and good for new comers and veterans alike a must buy and definitely has a place on my shelf amongst the best  best ever the best i 39 ve tried all the way all across the world glenmorangie tops the rest my favourite scotch amp loved by all served  i have a bottle purchased in scotland in 2002 it is still 3 4 full now just took a bit for a chest cold and woohoo we both enjoyed the burn and taste 24 years and counting  i have enjoyed glenmorangie for nearly fifty years smooth mouth feel soft notes well rounded i love the color a solid 10 year old and a bargain for the quality  presentation orange orange and more orange with some bronze and gold detailing the original 10 year old is certainly a bright bottle on any shelf with the elegantly shaped clear glass putting the whisky 39 s colour on show different but still very classy appearance bright gold colour in a glass more orange in the bottle with consistency maintained through the addition of e150 caramel colouring and chill filtration a common practice with larger distillery s flagship expressions aroma stone fruits strong ripe banana with water smells less of banana and more of honey flavour smooth strawberry banana citrus fruit zing faintest hint of oak spice and vanilla loses complexity with water as the flavours become harder to distinguish from each other finish medium length lingering spices would i buy it again yes glenmorangie the original 10 year old is an excellent go to highlands whisky it is also a great example of a whisky with a very fruity flavour profile it is smooth and easy to drink but still hangs around on your pallet long enough for you not to immediately forget that you tasted it that said there are many more glenmorangie expressions that i would also like to try  no peat or smoke v sweet with viscosity hints of coffee butter and slight toffee also fruit and cereals nice if you like highland styles but not dry enough for me now and after an outstanding laphroig 10 year recently this seems a let down but maybe thats unfair as v different types of whiskey  the chaps at master of malt are spot on but the nose also has a kind of cooling mint the palate is balanced and creamy vanilla and a shy oak in the background tiramisu ok toffee just a little peppery wave the finish is medium malty fruity and both mouth watering and dry 8 out of 10 yes it 39 s a good whisky not complex not punchy but good well balanced and clean very clean maybe a whisky for a newbie but also a whisky to enjoy whisky vets  a great choice for the price smooth and flavorful not overtly complex you get exactly what you are expecting light fruit and a long enjoyable finish i go to staple for an everyday scotch  im a huge glenmorangie fan i 39 ve had most of their private editions all the 12 years the 18 and the signet for the price this has to be one of their best picked a bottle up for 30 today and am blown away the nose is the creamiest nose of any whisky i 39 ve tried under 100 i suggest adding a couple drops of water to really open it up and make the palate equally as creamy fantastic stuff  if i 39 m out and about or someone brings out a selection of bottles to offer me a dram i often pick the glenmorangie because it never disappoints lovely and smooth creamy and sweet nice malty aftertaste i 39 m all out at the moment but not for long for the price glenmorangie 10 is very hard to beat  excellent everyday dram super soft and smooth very easy to sip extremely citrusy and floral throughout if i had to find one flaw it would be the abv could be higher perhaps 43 but this is a whisky for the masses for those reviewers that cannot handle this dram heartburn etc you must not be able to handle anything as glenmorangie produces the purest and cleanest whisky in scotland doesn 39 t get any quot gentler quot  hi just like nectar truley smooth and extremely addictive in a very nice sort of way the best i have ever tasted in 60 years my regardspeter scotland is still the great classic tasting and my 1 scotch for last 4 years i only buy this  i would add to the tasting notes nose includes the scent of highlands heather well done nine men of tain  everyone has different taste one guy likes coke another pepsi this my taste i really love this brand pretty sweet scotch highland scotch this is far from islay which i do not like great flavour  ouuuuu laaaaalaaaaa excellent single malt for the price  excellent for those like me who really don 39 t care for peat  very good choice for the price can t get nothing better  i am a bourbon fan i found whiskey to be too mild for me to enjoy an associate gave me a sample of this at his home and i was very impressed the american whiskey i had tried were unremarkable aged about 2 to 4 years this has matured for ten years and the time seems to make all the difference first to hit my taste is pepper then sweet citrus vanilla then a nectar flavor at the finish i found that a small splash of cool water brings out the finish a bit more this is odd for me as again i typically prefer my bourbon neat a definite addition to my cabinet this may become my new standard  a good choice to begin one 39 s single malt adventure  nice whiskey for the price good single malt with a very nice finish  i 39 m sorry but this is real bad astringent nose and burning on the tongue even with 2 drops water to subdue the harsh burn you can 39 t possibly taste this and let it dwell on your mouth as it burns your tongue so bad black label can outmatch this single malt and i had my fair share  kinda tangy for my taste but solid finish and viscosity a good sipper for the fruity palate  sweet and fruity with a nose full of flowers tastes wonderful as an after dinner dram  its flavor and smokiness that lingeres long on your tounge makes me a fan  a nice solid and fresh whiskey especially good considering its price i always enjoy a glass of this one wonderful whisky for the price rich smooth as silk with sweet hints of vanilla my favourite whisky in this price range  not a fan of scotch but i liked this one because it 39 s not too strong it 39 s really smooth and gentle to the stomach i loved it actually  a solid single malt scotch nothing spectacular but a smooth taste and flavor anyone could appreciate whether you like scotch or not  four stars very satisfying something is wrong besides the burn the bourbon casks almost dominate this excellent distillery 39 s signature notes vanilla and almonds on the astringent nose the citrus has nearly gone to sleep basic chocolate finish heat and severe lack of balance not liking the new ob the 12 wasn 39 t spectacular but was much much better i did all i could to give this 10 a chance  i have tried a lot of whisky 39 s over the years and this is a very solid well crafted whisky great value for money and very consistent i always have a bottle in the house  gelnmorangie the original 10 yr old remains in my opinion the best value including 12 year olds it is about 35 750 ml in my area a price that allows it to be used as my day to day scotch that is a good thing as 12 year old scotches are about all i like to drink now besides a good red wine with a good meal now and then to go up to what else i might drink including balvenie doublewood macallan 12 yr old two of my other favorites just isn t really worth it when alternatives go on sale or i just need a change then fine but going back to the glen 10 is always easy it helps that i usually add some ice to my scotch but even neat when the differences show up the most the glen 10 holds up pretty well  absolutely beautiful an original i can only think that the reserved and etc can only 39 be 39 better  es bueno pero no muy bueno pero igual me gusto  the tarlogians have it  love it beautiful wiskey i am new to the drinking of scotch whiskys i have tried several of the glen type scotch whiskys however i do enjoy the glenmorangie it is smooth and gentle to the taste and the stomach moreover i think the alcohol volume is just right but could be a bit stronger but not to give you a headache what other scotches do you recommend in this area  in ontario where whisky is expensive this one is a bargain i 39 d have a dram of this every day and nay complain  a great dram for the money  the 10 year is my quot go to quot scotch for a daily drinker is it the best i 39 ve ever had nope but it is damn good and great for the price i prefer a balvenie 14 or yamazaki for special occasions but i go through a bottle too quickly to justify buying balvenie on a weekly basis i think glenmorangie 10 is beautiful with hints of vanilla and floral tones best with a few drops of water to open it up  it burns my throat and brings on heartburn jim for the money how could you go wrong in my opinion it is smooth tasty and has lots of character my cabinet always has a few bottles of this at all times ginutis aged in former bourbon barrels it used to be that nearly 70 of scotch used former jack daniels barrels as some part of the aging process i tried glenmorangie 10 a little over a decade ago when it was aged in ex sherry casks and thought it was lovely with bourbon 39 s growing popularity before the boom scotch makers have experimented more with bourbon barrels for some expressions this works well albeit different but for something as light and delicate as glenmorangie 39 s single malt recipe the bourbon influence feels intrusive i share the feeling of many distilleries today that there is unrealized potential with ex bourbon barrel aging but for those who grew up on the old stuff i wish they 39 d make room in their storehouses for more traditional barrels i paid 35 for mine very cheap for the usa water helps and breathing my tears give it yet another unwanted dynamic hello to the folks at m o m i love what you do and appreciate your services this will likely be deleted no hard feelings maybe the 750ml bottles here are not up to par glenmorangie shouldn 39 t be hot mine burns not joking now even with water and breathing time i hope this bourbon experiment works out in the end i 39 d always said there were great bourbons out there maybe some scottish distilleries will locate those barrels eventuality lol take care gentleman thank you  it 39 s not a bad dram it 39 s smooth light and citrus vanilla cream but for the money spend a little extra for the nectar d 39 or my favorite or the quinta ruban 12 both are quite delicious and worth the little more in price i love laphroaig 18 and it 39 s smokey peat complexity but for super deliciousness the nectat d 39 or is hard to beat  glenmorangie is a wonderful whisky it is very smooth and a great introductory for any whisky drinker that is not to say it is a beginners whisky it is not it is a great whisky in it 39 s own right some people like steak rare some like it medium or well done who is to say they are wrong as i have aged i love glenmorangie as an easy whisky i can turn to any time any place whereas other whiskys that people comment on i have to be in the right frame of mind these days choose a stronger flavour whisky but that 39 s maybis as i 39 ve numbed myself with strong variations of everything from cheese to beer 39 anyway glenmorangie is an all round good 39 en those who don 39 t like it have mostly drunk too much to appreciate anything with a milder taste  no te dejes impresionar por ser un whisky economico este trago es casi perfecto con un color palido asombroso en nariz suave en boca muy fresco algo dulce por la vainilla pero con un balance que algunos macallans no alcanzan sin duda lo tendre en mi bar personal  hey do not know many things about whiskeys but that one had a really smooth taste and it did not leave my mouth for many minutes really loved it  not for me it probably didn 39 t help that i tasted this in the middle of a session of lagavulin and ardbeg but i was not a fan i still have a handful of the big names left to try macallan balvenie talisker highland park but i have a feeling i 39 m forever lost in the islay triangle ardbeg laproaig lagavulin  although i like talisker for a little peat this is a fine scotch smooth vanilla with a wonderful nose smoother and richer than the other glens imo first sip fruity and at the end a fresh sent of vanilla lone this for the price how ever dalmore 12 best for the price  pour it add water and let it sit for five minutes this malt becomes creamy and smooth vanilla and cream dominate the palate nose stays the same don 39 t be fooled into thinking this is a cheap whisky it 39 s a delicate whisky i will buy again it perfectly rings a change from my favorites islay malts glenmorangie 10 is a great single malt  when i first tried this a couple months ago i was happily surprised neat out of the bottle it was finesse delicate superb i thought this is scotch as it is meant to be before i read any reviews sure sometimes i want a peaty experience and this is not but for an every day nuanced and warm mouthfeel this is tops  very fruity full of flavor vanilla flowers medium body a gentle an elegant single malt  taste like a cheap american bourbon yuck this is a very complex scotch there are so many different tastes in each sip i usually sip on islay scotch thus this was a good change in pace  as a bartender i have had the opportunity to taste test many brands of high end and low end scotches for my tastes the only scotch that is better is glenmorangie 39 s 18 year old version which is twice the cost but not twice as good  i 39 m a glenmorangie fan hands up when i smell this i get lightly roasted almonds a sort of smooth creamy nuttiness with a bit of toasted sweetness a good example of how ubiquity in whisky this is so widely available everywhere in the uk in ireland does not mean pedestrian quality  smooth citrus notes are excellent better than average peppery finish a little light but the price is a no brainer got a 1 75 for 63 usa ever since encountering this pleasant whisky in edinburgh it has become my favourite brand very fruity and a hint of spicy for those of you who like a full bodied peat and smokey whiskey may i suggest a talisker for those who like a nice smooth wee nip this could be for you  i agree with the inestimable ralfy glenmorangie is one of the three or four most interesting complex malts out there the other being mentioned was pultney many new to scotch come from bourbon or are peat heads only able to appreciate explosive whiskies they miss the subtle ever changing quality of a malt like glenmorangie bill lumsden is the greatest artist in whisky today  very nice taste extremely smooth the notes of vanilla make it taste almost bourbon like which i don 39 t mind at all if you like smokey peaty whisky stay away from this though it 39 s much more of a lighter clearer flavor  this malt is amazing very smooth  i cannot for the life of me taste any dish soap i find it quite good a touch light but not in a negative way for my tastes perhaps rinse the glasses better  because it was a gift from my son i will give it a star however my first taste was quot hey quot tastes like dish soap check the waterford glass not that but too much alcohol and very little taste not recomended i prefer a little smoke maybe highland park  i 39 m more of a smoky peaty kind of guy but this isn 39 t too bad it 39 s sweet and smooth with lots of lingering fruity tastes on the tongue chilled is much better just one ice cube seems to be right for two fingers worth overall i 39 d say this is worth the 30 bucks i paid but would prefer the peat i love so much  best 10 year but try the 12 year and quinta ruban easy to drink good intro to single malt along with glenlivet 12 and laphroaig 12  i found it to have a harsh alcohol taste and not as much actual flavor  unbeatable at the price if you don t like this you don t like whisky do they even bother to store this in barrels or do they just keep it in a metal vat for 10 years this is better than any of the cheap blend scotches but for a few bucks more you can get single malt that is 10x as good  fruity not terribly smooth hardly any flavor zero mouth feel if i m trying to be cheap speyburn 10 is a better option that s harsher but at least it s interesting  no wonder it sells so well in scotland benchmark malt that never fails for me  i believe this is easy to sip nice citrus notes too but not something that screams quot have another laddie quot  i performed a blind taste test with 4 dinner guests the samples included 4 different levels of johnnie walker and this glenmorangie original 10 year old the guests recognized johnnie walker blue label as being the smoothest and had the best flavor johnnie walker black label came in second johnnie walker platinum label came in third and johnnie walker gold label forth and dead last was this glenmorangie the glenmorangie had too much of an alcohol bite and not much flavor  a very smooth drinkable dram pleasantly spicy fruity and not to creamy just right o k it s not that sophisticated on the palate but still one of my favourites and you cannot go wrong for the price of it  drinking straight up no ice no adulteration and it tastes like a mix of cheap whiskey that you can get for 10 bucks a bottle and a pretentious one that goes at 10 times that applying the laws of averages it is not an auchentoshan or a glenfiddich or a laphroig and neither is it as smooth as a blend from jw unless my opinion changes shortly this would be the first and last bottle  i am a huge fan of the islay s this scotch is of course no peat bog ashtray in your mouth died and gone to heaven islay but it is smooth flavorful and a nice diversion from my norm i bought it on a whim and chose it for the decent rating and good price and was not disappointed my son new to the game enjoys it as well i ve also enjoyed numerous other single malts over the years and this ranks well among them in fact i liked it enough that i was looking for ratings on other glenmorangie products to try quinta ruban lasanta nectar d or when i found this web page i rarely make comments on the quot interwebs quot but i liked this reasonably priced gem enough to do so slainte  utterly reliable you always know what you re getting and what you re getting is something all scots know is great value for money a lovely fresh taste fruity balanced and a nice long malt tang on the tongue to finish a real desert island malt  it is smooth but it well it just doesn t explode with flavors its just one burst of lemon that takes forever to fade away got a deal on this for 40 bucks plus it has 3 samplers of older and different barrel scotches for the same amount of money actually less you can go to costco and get a superb bottle of 18 year old highland single malt scotch ill drink this and enjoy it for what it is and then move on to the next bottle for tasting maybe there 18 year old bottles will fill the palate more  smooth fruity and very tasty  just started carrying at our costco palm beach gardens fl seems to be selling quite well  i heard that this is the best selling scotch in scotland i wonder why i found it to have too much of an alcohol bite to it not smooth and at 43 abv i didn t want to add much water it just didn t rock my world will not repurchase  best i ve ever had smooooooooth outstanding love it the color like lillet amazing floral light yet mature  just got this one as a gift from a good friend a lady having 10y laphroaig in my backpack so we tasted both quite a contrast of course while fulfilling the description above it doesn t lack subtle complexity i m rather peaty smoky fan but this just tasted good and as many have written before it s an easy drink not only for ladies  this was recommended by a lifelong scotch drinking friend i am not disappointed a great value  was browsing the isles at the liquor store not into the peaty stuff like laphroaig yet i have a hard time enjoying that strong islay stuff i like jw black and blue et al and this stuff is smooth and very tasty great price too  very good stuff this will decently be one of my basics you can keep on adding water without loosing complexity impressing for a 10 year old  very easy drinking nice to the palate if you are experiened drinker i can understand the low rating however as it stands it s a very decent piece of whisky love it  there is nothing wrong with the original and this is it s main problem it s ok but bland  the nose is excellent vanilla toffee marshmallow palate is good too with the vanilla and citrus notes i absolutely love the finish as well fairly long and a tiny bit smoky with more vanilla and citrus as well as pepper  tried balvenie double cask glenfiddich 12 glenlivet 12 and now this this is by far more interesting smoother and easier to have a second dram having said that it s also quietly shy in the peat department but i think that s why people love it peat is either entirely lacking or buried under the citrus floral notes overall i d say if you want something easy to drink that l i ve been sticking to the uber peat islay scotches but i picked this one up from a store that had no other selection and don t regret the small peat break i enjoy it especially the price i m still craving a glass of laphroaig 10 yr but i m pleased with this as a bottle to alternate with so that my other whiskies last a little longer for me the orange peel taste is a little too prominent but it s very smooth i drink it with one ice cube found two cubes to dilute it too much  a good everyday dram those with a more advanced palate will pick up the flavours but i think a lot of the reviews on here are from new drinkers or those that don t enjoy a dram and just want to drink  this shit is awful  very good smooth whisky i am a big fan of single malts i have always seen glenmorangie on shelves of the my liquor store but for some reason never bought it my son gave a me this bottle for christmas this year i restrain myself from buying single malts all the time due to their higher prices compared to their american cousins however i can actually afford glenmorangie 10 year old on a regular basis please don t change a thing including the prices  forgot to give stars with previous review here they are always delicious sometimes makes your taste buds work for the reward of deeper complexities sometimes gives up its prize more easily reckon could be down to temperature effecting what it gives off unless of course it s the palate that has moods it s a bright cheerful whisky that d be refreshing in summer evenings or warming on winter nights lot going on for a standard price malt some people don t get it but could be down to temperature or their not being receptive enough  if you re new to whisky i think this is a good starting point as it goes down easy and the flavours aren t too overwhelming for the inexperienced i fully admit to being a complete novice when it comes to whisky though i have tried my fair share but if i was to chose an everyday dram this would definitely be a contender  this whisky is a good starting point for people who like sweet liquor like port brandy etc it is also a good starting point for people who like smoky whiskies bourbons who want to ease their way towards the fruity sweet world of port and sherry cask whiskies or softer maltier speyside and lowland scotches it s the fruit honey and vanilla notes that will excite someone useto irish whisky  fruity smile you ve just tasted the fruits of a love egg it begs the question why when all you have to do is try and fish it out if a can doh idiot first dram in craven a cottages halfway up the an field slope to bedmibgton could you at least try with easing it past the guard talk about albert rn oh at least pretend to enjoy it by slurping hard good night cap  i love scotch more than ron burgundy for my lt 50 choices glenmorangie reigns supreme i d stack it against my favorite 50 75 choice the glenlivet 18 yr old prices in cad  i like this however i only buy it when it is on offer why is that is it not that good is it not as fashionable is it too commonly available i can t figure it out but i tend to plump for balvenie or the lasanta instead  had this and enjoy the smooth vanilla notes  i picked up a bottle here in miami fl for 29 99 a definate bargain this is a very easy drinking whisky i do leave the bottle open for 24hrs cause this 10 yr expression can be a little restless when first opened its smooth sweet and nutty lemons traces of milk chocolate fresh pastry and the unmistakable freshness of florals and perfumes that glenmorangie is famous for if you let it sit in your glass for 15 min the milk chocolate will creep up ever so slightly probably the most complex single malt under 40 00 highly recommended if you are on a budget  haters are always around for the great it s unavoidable however they may yell that someone or something isn t worth your time and money think and try for yourself i personally love this scotch for it s subtle complexity and long spicy finish and no it does not i repeat not need to be chilled to enjoy it s wonderful flavors to you who are looking for a great everyday dram this is the one and to the haters no one is listening  i have never been a whiskey drinker except from winning a bottle after a rugby tournament on islay and wasting it on a drunken night immediately after to numb the pain however after doing some bodywork repair on a colleges car he gave me a bottle of glenmorangie original 10 i have always been a vodka drinker usually drinking it straight expensive vodkas and whilst watching my f1 off a backshift decided to try it wow really surprised nice flavour and goes down well so much so i went online to see different reviews as i now quite fancy getting a premium bottle  a great tasting scotch deserves every compliment indeed first tried straight smokey and hints of vanilla combined with charcoal got to admire the concentration of a wonderful single malted scotch a must buy again type rather than a try first regret later do not serve on rocks but do try chilled and straight or paired with ginger ale  compared with other big name distilleries this is a better entry than most a little more assertive a little more complex but won t blow you away with either as a whisky bar owner i find myself going to this one when i don t want to think too much about nuances but don t want a bland malt either  smooth sweet with a hint of vanilla chocolate got a 1l bottle for 163 35 can t complain  you can always recognize the glenmorangie signature i m really fan of this distillary this malt is a 10 years old matured and you easily feel this citrus fruity with a delicious smell fresh and little spicy great whisky  for a ten year old its good some interesting flavour notes maybe to much of vanilla but that s pleasant comparing to its price point competitors a very very good drop and a staple of any whisky collection always replaced once finished very drinkable dram  easy to drink tastes like vanilla and honey great finish nose 23 delicate but complex creamy with a fruity nose hints of pineapple peach and dried fruit very slight marzipan notes palate 24 creamy and sweet yet very gentle and delicate fruity and floral but neither overstated or understated finish 24 an excellent and gently warming mid finish balance 24 an excellent balance from a complex whisky delicate gentle smooth and soothing nothing overpowering overall 95 an excellent whisky worthy of its price a wonderfully delicate journey from buying the ticket to coming home  its very good experience for the price citric honeyed sweet and vanilla delicate finish i recomend no more of two ices for glass  it s a rare moment to be saying this but having to choose between an unimaginative blend like jw or teachers or this one i d take the blend or maybe just settle for a glass of water instead  a very nice easy drinking 10 year single malt a nice alternative to a blend for every day drinking  fruity it is just malty oaky and very very sugary stuff  i usually expect some peat smoke influence in scotch this one has little none instead it is light and sweet with a creamy smoothness that is so nice this is the best selling single malt in scotland for a reason i love the simplicity that a younger malt offers  i have a major soft spot for glenmorangie and i do not mind drinking this yet i had a serious epiphany when i lined up this version against the previous version wow if you all think that this one is tasty you may not know how much of a let down this is from the much smoother fuller and more delicate round bottle version i m making the old version my bar staple  firstly you have to remember this is an entry level scotch it is not made to challenge bottles of 4 times the price for what you pay its a very easy drinking and enjoyable single malt its uncomplicated and smooth with a gentle aftertaste its a great drink for anyone thats new to whisky drinking in a nutshell for the money you cant go wrong  i dink and enjoy all whisky from the lightly flavored ones to the smoky peats however until tonight 12 1 13 i ve never have glenmorangie man i ve been missing out i enjoyed a wee dram over one rock of ice and enjoyed a quot nice and easy quot drink of vanilla caramel toffee and marshmallow i usually drink the other glens glenfiddich and glenlivet but after tonight s dram i m very happy to have the glenmorangie in my collection  maybe i got a better bottling because for the price i found this to be a marvelous whisky it is wonderfully balanced and full bodied and for a 10 year old malt has a surprisingly long finish marked with toffee and pepper i can not stress enough how much i enjoyed the pepper notes in this whisky truly great and something which is being replaced or superseded by peat nowadays it is still a great fruity malt with apples moldy nutty orange and citrus tastes with vanilla butterscotch aromas highly recommended especially if you can get it cheap in a supermarket nb check out the 18 year old expression very nice  just special enough to be enjoyed by itself and to be savoured quite a closed taste and benefits from ice water toffee and caramel lovely scotch would certainly recommend as beginner s single malt enjoy had a wee dram this am 1900 glasgow hours my first more fruity then glengoyne more aromatic than the glenlivet and more complex than the glenfiddich great to start with before dinner the creamy texture and ethereal fruitiness is as haunting as the scottish cat of the highlands enjoy the pleasantries of this 10yo  girlfriend car etc and glenmorangie was my 1st proper whisky good dependable entry level dram and more refined than the glenfiddich 12 yo and more flavoursome than the glenlivet  nice range of flavors especially when taken neat one of my favorites for the price i do not recommend over ice as you will lose the high notes still my go to from glenmorangie if you like this you will also likely enjoy the d or  samoth taste i found this scotch to be dull and felt it had more alcohol burn than much in the way of interesting flavors not a smooth scotch  glenmorangie was my first initiation into good scotch having worked as a bartender and the awful stuff that we used to serve as bar scotch glenmorangie became my regular and was a great starting point to an almost obscene love affair with scotch it s my personal bar scotch and the better ones are consumed sparingly  glenmorangie original 10 is a decent staple whisky especially on an entry level basis lovely sweetness and honey notes and for under 30 this isn t one to sit down with and explore this is a whisky made to enjoy in the most simple way possible drink it  on first taste i was surprised by the sweetness but this is an excellent smooth whisky i still prefer it to all the glenmorangie wood finishes especially because of the surprisingly complex and fragrant nose  finer balanced whisky good light whisky for person looking to be introduced to the world of malt 92 100 this is a classic whisky the poor reviews here are undeserved 1 out of 10 serve chilled wtf the balance and complexity is what makes this a world class whisky ignore the haters this is renowned for a reason  a great middle range whisky robust smoky rich a great every day whisky  how much i am not a big fan of this particular scotch it is simply overwhelmed with the vanilla flavor and i was unable to taste any other notes except cold temperature seems to bring out the flavors so perhaps if the bottle were chilled it could taste better  excellent early summer dram citrus with sweet cream that becomes peppery spicy pepper citrus aftertaste lingers great on a warm spring day very enjoyable for the price  as far as your run of the mill 10 year old single malts go this one is right up there with the very best love the citrussy notes  i simply just don t like it better to save for 21 years glenfarclas 
1950.0, not sure about this one it 39 s certainly not bad and i 39 m no expert but i get mixed messages on my tongue seems quite sweet perhaps dare i say even a bit fruity  a delicate rounded amp smooth malt i 39 ve been looking for something a bit simpler for a while now for years i 39 d lived the peaty and smoky makes from islay and aran but suddenly they didn 39 t appeal anymore i was looking for something full bodied and dry i really dislike sweetness in my whiskey this was on special at another store and i believe the more mature a scotch is generally the dryer it gets the dalwhinnie 15 yo hit the spot lovely and dry plenty of kick but also very smooth and a great price will be my favorite for them time being  not so sure about this 15 year drinking the laphroig 10 and the highland park 12 along side and the dalwhinnie is not as enjoyable maybe my palate isnt catching the nuance but my lagavulin 16 blows my mind i also love several balvenie double port rum woods coal ila and ardbeg not sure why this dalwhinnie is not doing it for me oh well good for my guests  superb quality at the price the go to whisky if you can 39 t really figure what to drink very well balanced i drank this after having sm lousy whisky and it made my evening great andy silk like smoothness with a reassuring after taste that warms the soul  just put the empty bottle in the bin enjoyed every drop need to talk nice to the wife for another bottle a really smooth easy drinking whiskey recommended for any occasion  sophisticated scotch smooth like the speyside whiskeys but richer and tastier very interesting colour and finish i am impressed by the large array of flavours i sipped this single malt in a glencairn glass with a drop of cold water  very smooth a nice whiskey that s great value for money great smooth taste my new favorite scotch  easy drinking beautiful delicate and refreshing if morning scotch was a thing it might be at my house this would be the one  5 stars simply for value for money this is like that warm familiar cosy blanket that you wrap yourself up with on a cold evening  fantastic whisky and great price very smooth and a lovely honey flavour great neat or on the rocks soo smooth  very smooth interesting sweet flavour which can sometimes feel almost liqueur like in its after taste  i tried this at the distillery after the tour and instantly fell in love delightful on the nose and so easy to drink a bottle of this never lasts long in our house  to my taste this is a pretty old school dram subtle but not overly complex there 39 s just a touch of honey at the finish no water needed with this one it 39 s a great whisky for sharing with good friends a contemplative dram for a winter evening lovely  never tasted a better one for the price first taste subtle nose sweet fruity maybe smokie on the tongue smooth with a slight sharpness as expected from a single malt after taste manuka honey malty not peaty so preferable to my taste  the best nose and flavour heather honey this is a very nice light whisky nose cardamon perfume palate burnt fudge and sweet oak spice after wood spice lingers with hints of sweet fruits  a solid dalwhinnie i am an quot islay and talisker quot kind of guy but i also enjoy well balanced and deep rich high quality speyside highland malts and this is one of them others include glen farclas cragganmore mortlach etc from other regions springbank deserves an honorary mention lowlanders are mostly boring but rosebank is worth a try if you can find a bottle at a decent price every fresh dram of this opens up a flavour which you failed to detect in the previous tasting when you sip this liquid gem next to dalwhinnie winter gold you just cannot stop admiring the quality of this old classic it is a pity that younger generations think winter gold is dalwhinnie talisker too tarnished their reputation somewhat with substandard products like skye storm and dark storm port ruighe is excellent though especially if you like cragganmore port finish  for me it 39 s a salted caramel more caramel than salt smells lovely and very smooth love it  i don 39 t get the gentle smoke at all but it 39 s not what i 39 d class as sweet either not unpleasant by any means but not one or the other in my book  dalwhinnie is simply a delight for the money it s an easy drinking whisky with a pleasant honey smooth taste that had a discreet toffee lingering whilst not overly complex it is nonetheless a solid addition to any collection and something to drink just as a whisky and not because it is a time for a special time for the money i would give it 5 5 but for the taste i would give it a 3 75 my overall score is 4 5 my only gripe is that every time i over excitedly open a bottle i cut my finger for some reason it s more of a note of caution than a complaint  honey mild flavours but still quite interesting easy to drink and pretty good value a great everyday dram  solid long mellow flavour very enjoyable despite not being very complex a good gift gratefully recieved this is one of my favourite whisky 39 s it 39 s delicate and smooth taste leaves you feeling like you 39 ve had a taste of something much more expensive and leaves a smile on your face the sweetness feels honey smooth as it goes down a very good dram which is everything you want and more  nothing of great significance for the nose which leads to a hasty kickoff on the sip front this is where the dram starts to show promise smooth flirtations of caramel a spark and a little bit of an evocative nod to some very well regarded drams however fin there is nothing more other than a trip to the memory bank to try and connect this dram with something more worthwhile no character no age nothing significant other than a creamy first dance my favourite whisky by far the only drawback is once it s opened you ll not want to close it a beautiful dram this 15 year old is a match for single malts that are twice the price great value amp a great dram this is a nice dram there 39 s sweetness honey almost a touch of sherbert too it 39 s like being in an old fashioned sweet shop and being given samples to try the finish has more than a hint of pear drops lovely  so smooth sometime the best things in life are the simplest and most un complicated like beans on toast or darwhinnie 15 you simply enjoy it for what it is which is a mellow amp easy drinking scotch with just enough flavours and notes to explore i had 39 nt had a bottle for 6 months or so but recently bought two after re uniting with it and it never disappoints one word of warning though i personally don 39 t find the 39 winters gold 39 a patch on the 15 even if you can get it for a tenner less during your supermarket 39 rollback 39 for some reason that expression just is 39 nt there  this is amber nectar they also do one that goes in the freezer its smooth out of all the whiskeys i 39 ve tried over the years this probably my favourite what a whisky smooth and beautiful drops notes fruits appel honey toffee and vanilla which i got definitely worth getting it  what a brilliant malt at this price show me another 15yo malt with this quality in this price range fruity confectionary rolling malt considering price vs quality this should be in everyone 39 s collection ian just took delivery of my bottle of amber joy smooth and subtle fruity notes cheers  fantastic dram for a very reasonable price my new go to has been found a very smooth drop and a joy to drink  my favourite whisky  from the nose i get simple fruit with a touch of dusty hay a hit of smoke rising the dram directly fills my palate with vanilla and a few dried floral notes the finish lingers with a few ripe but semi bitter pecans of all things like it no i love it simple with soft complexity  it s not challenging or complicated but it has five or six cracking flavours pear cinnamon honey vanilla and toffee drank 1st time today great taste and lively down the hatch  just had a tasting of 17 whiskys the dalwhinnie 15 was the favourite  i 39 m not a fan of smokey peaty scotches but i love the smokey linger of this bottle it marries well with the fruity aroma and lingering and lovely nutty finish the more i drink it the more i appreciate it  fantastic pour tons of honey nuts vanilla cake and icing just a hint of smoke delicious  this is a rather nice dram it is really quite full almost oily with nice sweet nutty flavours very easy to drink especially in nice weather a great bargain for 15 years old i think distillers edition is better though with more sherry coffee flavours shining through in that one very good value this one and impossible not to enjoy 128526  excellent smooth aromatic and flavoursome clean full flourish this is very simple straight forward single malt aged 15 years only in ex bourbon barrels and it shows on the nose vanilla salt slight hints of cinnamon honey and fresh apple sweetness taste for the first split second you get sweet vanilla it turns into dark heather honey with a little bit of salt slight floral notes in the background maybe a tiny hint of smoke if you really really want to look for it you will find it other than that you won 39 t probably notice any smoke butter cookie walnut and hints of spicy oak finish oily mouthfeel honey hay chamomile and slightly bitter tea in the end to be honest i haven 39 t had the dalwhinnie 15 for some years and remembered it to be sweeter and much more smooth it seems like it has changed a bit i even did a comparison against other similar whiskies that are at my disposal mostly 12years old and it was the harshest of them i experimented with water time in the glass etc maybe i got a bad bottle maybe i need to give it even more time to rest in the bottle and quot breathe quot a bit but at the moment it feels disappointing it is still ok but in my opinion there are smoother more complex whiskies for less money even though most of them are younger  crisp amp clean solid and smooth love the gentle hint of smoke good value why not  caught my attention from the very first sip nice travel in the flavor all the way through without any burn would definitely get it again  odd this one reminds me of an open field very sweet flowery and smooth well the 200ml bottlei bought was super smooth easily a 90 100 if not higher however i got a 700ml full bottle yesterday and that 39 s much less smooth with a kind of a burn to it i 39 d only give that bottle an 80still a good whisky for the price but i as i still have both i can confirm that not all dalwhinnie 15 year bottles are the same one of mine is far superior to the other  this is by far my favourite whisky smooth too smooth sweet and flavorful i would rate this as five stars if it were a bit hotter  very nice easy drinking scotch this is an easy drinking whisky but the slight smoke in the background and the 43 bottling prevent it from being boring it reminds me a little of bushmills 10 so i just poured a drop of that to compare bushmills 10 is more floral tannic like second steeped black tea and thinner on the palate the dalwhinnie has less going on on the nose for me is more balanced toffeelike richer and sweeter on the palate oilier and has the nice whiff of smoke a tiny drop of water brings out saltiness and intensifies the sweetness strong toffee i like both but probably prefer the dalwhinnie  solid highland scotch smooth finish adding a couple drops of water like many highlands really opens it up  this is one of my go to smooth malt whiskies it is so pleasant and drinkable and a delight to drink in my opinion far better than dalwhinnie winter 39 s gold which i don 39 t enjoy nearly so much  a tasty highland whisky my first bottle has come to an end nice crisp flavorful  good whisky and easy drinker simple and not as complex as islay whisky for sure i mean a lagavulin 16yo is far better than this in my opinion the perfect bottle we drink when my dad and mum come around  caramel and toffee easily the smoothest scotch ive ever had not much complexity not good but certainly not bad 3 5 5 easy palette and just a hint of peat my go to  a friend of mine said he hates scotch because it tastes like a band aid to him i don t know what he tried that caused that reaction but sometimes dalwhinnie tastes that way to me i cannot taste the subtle undertones like i can with other scotch it is smooth i will give it that i tried long sessions of savoring as a master taster might do but i still can t taste whats so special about it i know others love it so i wont 1 star it suffice to say its not for me  i apologise for my amateurish review but i 39 ll say as i find a delicate smooth whisky extremely easy and pleasant to drink no harsh surprises no burning of the throat just a welcome warm tingle as you allow the liquid to gently slide down possible note of toffee who knows not me i know little of peats bouquets or notes but i know what i like and i love this and please no ice  excellent malt whisky with the perfect amount of peat for my taste if you 39 re a peat head look elsewhere but if you want a smooth malty whisky with a bit of smoke and a long sweet finish this is a great value  medium body quite classic character of highland whisky plus smoky palate satisfyingly to its finish  i enjoyed a bottle of this for my 30th birthday with friends i decided to pick this bottle because i 39 d heard it was on the sweeter end isn 39 t too complex flavour wise and i was sure that even the non whiskey drinkers in the group would enjoy it i 39 d say it 39 s perfect for that but actually i was quite surprised by how much i enjoyed it it was a medley of grandma 39 s most famous desserts toffee caramel vanilla custard walnut cake followed by a brisk walk around her garden in the spring time all together an enjoyable experience and an excellent bottle to properly introduce whiskey drinking to your friends  i tried this and did not trust the people that says this is for the birds too bad they were right very sweet with a long strong finish reminiscent of something much much cheaper found it completely disappointing and have tried much better whiskey or 20 or 30 less a bottle  i was turned on to this by a liquor store owner then i switched to bookers but while i did drink this i was proud to share this with friends who would compliment its easily noticeable notes scents and tastes  just cracked this one open and it did not disappoint on the nose was cereal balsa wood and peach the palate was stiff with slight hints of caramel and leather but it opened up dramatically with a few drops of water i then got toasted almonds an emerging sweetness notes of fig and a more aromatic flavor the finish was long a spicy and malty finish  one of the best 4 the price if you dont enjoy this your taste buds are gone  those last 3 years make all the difference in the world this is an excellent single malt i 39 m not going to use an scotch snob comments about notes and the like this has got to be one of the best deals on the single malt market at seventy quid a bottle it is a reasonably priced treasure the only reason i didn 39 t give it 5 stars is because i would reserve those ratings for the ultra class of scotch  pretty much individual preference if you talking bout whiskey this 15yrs old is smooth and rich and very value for money will buy again  out of 16 bottles of scotch in my cabinet this is my favorite proof you don 39 t need to break the bank to enjoy great scotch  not good dalmore 12 year beats this hands down just got a bottle as a dinner present had mixed memories of not liking it very much and it being great problem solved i don 39 t like it very much it is like an alcoholic citrus juice harsh finish alcohol very noticable stings the cheeks and lips rather dissapointing  when you don 39 t feel like diving again in a smoky peaty seaweed bliss and instead are in the mood of something fruity honeyed crisp and clean don 39 t look any further  love it  nose rubbing alcohol palate slight citrus with cardboard finish dry long unpleasant very overrated in my opinion it was rated so well and i had high hopes just to be let down the nose was sharp and smelled like straight rubbing alcohol the palate was like cardboard that had been soaked in citrus juice the finish was by far the worst i ve ever had by being a long dry and down right unpleasant one you re better off not buying this bottle the only reason i gave it two stars is because it s scotch and i liked the bottle the bottle even says the gentle spirit that was a lie save your money  i 39 m primarily an islay fan as in corryvreckan and uigeadail and laphroiag 1 4 cask but like all things in life balance is important and this is just great as a juxtaposition to the bare knuckle fight that islay brings to an evening it 39 s also readily available everywhere as discounted prices ok so i prefer something like a 39 bundah as the ultimate destination from corry via oogie but that 39 s not something you can pick up in tescos in the meantime this is just fine  what a wonderful highland warm but smooth finish phenomenal  wife says reading notes above it would make a nice fruit cake the tasting notes i read were most accurate this is a thoroughly enjoyable highland malt the palate is simply sublime  har aldrig tyckt om highlandwhisky till jag smakade den h 228 r den 228 r fantastiskt god  wish the finish is a bit longer the nose and palate is wonderful  very smooth with a great nose and hint of smokiness  1st time i ve tried this great tasting malt will definitely be having a few more tipples  excellent single malt with array of great flavours my friend bought a round of drinks in a pub consisting either of brandy or single malt whisky of dalwhinnie i had the whisky and drank it with great reverence this is a very refined drink where the flavour and alcohol were fused impeccably most of all when i drank it a warm glow spread throughout my body i have drank the more common type of whisky 39 s a lot in pubs but this dalwhinnie has opened a new gate for me in regard to single malt whisky  i have been a single malt scotch for many years at a recent gala which i attended dalwhinnie was the only single malt scotch available it was my introduction to dalwhinnie single malt and i was pleasantly impressed by it 39 s delightful taste i usually pay much more for single malt scotch whiskey  great value for money a great highland whisky can really get the toffee and at the moment this is my favourite whisky i got my bottle at as a gift although it is a great price for the quality of the whisky well worth it  from the reviews below it seems that the dalwhinnie 15yo inspires strong reactions in both directions personally i love it it s my go to default evening dram i won t pretend that my taste buds spot each and every one of the myriad flavours that the chaps at master of malt identify but it s a fascinating melange once i d worked out what it was the background to me is marzipan overlain with tinned fruit salad mandarin oranges with an occasional but not always lovely shot of aniseed and weaving softly through the flavours a gentle shy wreath of smoke like a wisp of mist in the glen i m not a fan of heavily peated smoky iodinised western isles whiskies but in the dalwhinnie 15yo the occasional hint of smoke helps create something special it s one of life s small pleasures that a whisky of this quality can still be bought for a relatively modest sum  whisky delle highland meravigliosamente buono mi immergo nell 39 assaggiare questo dalwhinnie la sensazione che lascia 232 di essere immerso in campo fiori con la sua giusta dose di dolcezza un 15 anni di ottima qualit 224  at the price point it is among the best single malts around and one with genuinely unique complexity starts off with a hint of spice and malty character but finishes with a hint of smoke will no doubt be a staple in my collection  great yum  i prefer a teachers or an ordinary blend than this nothing interesting about it and nowhere peat or smoke  first taste turned me in too a true whiskey lover yuck the alcohol taste is overwhelming i don 39 t know if it 39 s just me but i didn 39 t taste any of the flavors in the description disappointed but glad i just got a sample first  this one seems like a watered down highland park or benriach to me it 39 s okay there 39 s nothing wrong with it just nothing terribly inspiring either i say quot watered down quot but maybe it 39 s just that there 39 s slightly less peat but i think it 39 s still more peat than a glenfiddich or a jw or a hakushu i 39 m weird i like either a ton of peat islay or just a waft this one was slightly more than a waft so ick ymmv  let it sit in the glass for a bit if you 39 re drinking neat it 39 s not the best scotch i 39 ve ever had but this is an excellent fruity scotch to enjoy there is more alcohol than i expected on the nose but the amazing range of flavors makes up for that it 39 s soft to me overall and fruity and floral with a touch of honey suckle vanilla and toffee it has a warm finish i wouldn 39 t call it long however bottom line this is a good scotch  simply delicious an elegant delicate would you hate me if i said feminine palate it begins sweet and honied then politely gives way to a nutty spicy gingered fruit that lingers just long enough to introduce a whiff of smoke and peat that languishes on the finish it is quot the gentle spirit quot just like a lady  i first tried this in 2009 on a trip to scotland and loved it i even visited the distillery after tasting it at a bar it was smooth enough to drink straight i hadn 39 t had any for a few years and bought some recently it is definitely not the same drink it is way harsher and i can 39 t enjoy it without a little water makes me wonder what changed  simple with a clean finish i expected something more interesting for the price not worth the but worth a taste once  great dram you wont be disappointed  such a nice bottle will get another 1 soon and rich white bottom  this is a very good single malt well worth the money  it 39 s great  realy like the taste and it stays in your mouth for a long time  don 39 t forget to give it time in the glass very flavorful big juicy sherbet note in the palate  this is one of the nice single malt i have before value for money in malaysia this is selling expensive cost 163 50 envy you guys enjoying much resonalbel price  while it is very good it lacks what the dalmore has rich deliciousness  i 39 m surprised by many very high scores and it being widely seen as smooth i was instantly struck by the harsh palate and alcohol for a single malt and unfortunately left unimpressed  if you want to get a pie for a party you get apple pie not cause it is really anyones favorite but because no one really hates it dal 15 is like that it plays it safe it is still scotch but takes no bold stances slightly peaty and virtually no smoke but the value in this scotch is its timidness it is a great beginners scotch if you look at any blog or info on beginners scotch drinking this is the 1 recommended i have one in my cabinet always for the scotch dabbler that comes over now and again  don 39 t like the style at all taste is terrible for scotch whisky  any complexity this bottle has is lost with its rubbing alcohol finish not very enjoyable spend the few extra bucks and get something worth your time  its the sooo smooth and with a drop of water it is magnificent very smooth easy favors continued to please through the mild aftertaste  dalwhinnie 15 is just so smooth and balanced it is sweet and soft and great to give those who say they don 39 t like scotch i 39 m on my third bottle rich with the toffee and honey influence  honey vanilla and toffee are the flavors i liked it but after it a gentle smoke is coming i didn 39 t like it at all i think a sweet and a smoke are two components that can not be combined it 39 s like drink a sweet tea with smoked salmon  tastes great with cookies  pour three fingers in a crystal scotch glass add three ice cubes and walk away good stuff  i tried it for the first time this month and i fell in love with a glass bottle and smooth scotch  it 39 s good  honey vanilla and toffee are the prominent flavours for me very smooth and drinkable so would be a great introduction for non whisky drinkers others have mentioned smoke but if it 39 s there it 39 s extremely subtle compared to islay malts such as lagavulin and laphroaig an excellent whisky for the price  intense flavor this is my favorite highland whisky and i 39 ve bought several bottles not particularly smooth at first for a 15 year but a splash of water makes all the difference honey and sweet grasses followed by burning hay and a slightly salty finish this is a classic malt of scotland and represents its region perfectly this stuff is great the sugarbear delightful sipping whiskey silky and smooth as butter restrained notes of smoke and peat warmth spread quickly from my chest through all my fingers and toes bought for me as a birthday drink but will treat myself to bottle today  great flavor warm finish i used the last 250ml to soak a medium toast american oak to add to a aging a test batch of braggot made from golden promise malted barley chilliwack thistle honey and a dry ale yeast  perfect smoky finish not rough at all found it all too easy to drink will most definitely buy again very soon  not a fan bought this as it stated its got smoky finish of surprising intensity and i love peat it just wasn 39 t there hints of honey rather weird palate quick dry finish no clue why high scores poured me some laddy instead  nice delicious aromatic a given this is a done deal  . clean and very flavorful very smooth single malt honey and vanilla hint with a light smokey finish delightful  this was my first scottish single malt and i daresay that i picked a great one the honey and vanilla sponge flavour descriptions are spot on and the finish is exquisite  absolutely gorgeous first time and i love it i 39 m a relative newbie to the wonderful world of single malts and this was my first taste of a highland whisky had tried the island pete bombs so wanted a whisky that offered a 39 counter 39 to this type wasn 39 t disappointed it 39 s light fruity and as is often said really does taste like malted honey very unlike blends and other malts i have tasted i think this is more of an 39 occasion 39 dram but is very exciting on the nose lots of butterscotch fruit and honey for me not a really long finish but more crisp and refreshing would go very well with rich sticky deserts or rum and raisin ice cream  really nice whiskey this isn 39 t a criticism but i didn 39 t find it massively complex what it does it does very well indeed lovely  super  smooth warm flavorful the best scotch for the money a real value  rather pleasing to drink for a whisky not harsh as i expected bought the 20cl bottle as it isn 39 t cheap but might i say will be buying again in the future for the price range this is another solid performer nice clean crisp taste  irrespective of the remarkably low price dalwhinnie 15 is by far one of the finest single malts in scotland this simple clean albeit elegant and unpretentious highland whisky composes an equilibrium of honey the master of malt chaps here are spot on in terms of identifying manuka honey taste it 39 s dominant cinnamon in tandem with the buttery notes of walnuts and almonds there is also an unobtrusive flavour of citrus more gentle lime than overwhelming lemon the peat and smoke are just as subtle and contribute effectively to the overall elegance of this superb dram  i enjoy this fifteen year old dalwhinnie in the late afternoon before dinner  one of the very best singles i have ever tasted not too smokey just right i love it it will be my single malt to go to from now on  definitely more money than my regular dram johnnie walker gold but absolutely worth a try smooth many flavour profiles which reveal themselves each and every sip i usually stick to blends for the robust big flavours but this delivers with undeniable balance and full nose  a fine aroma brings me back to mucking about the moors i have recently tried dalwhinnie and very impressed i myself am a fan of simple flavours and find this tastes like a whisky should there is nothing too complex going on just simple subtle flavours as i sip this i am alternating with jurah elixir these are world 39 s apart jurah has far too much going on for my tastes while dalwhinnie i find is a perfect light subtle drink if i had never tasted whisky this is exactly how i would imagine it would taste delicious i have fond memories of my last fairly recent purchase strictly an aperitif it 39 s so light one needs to have a clear palate and be in an optimal tasting nosing environment to fully appreciate this beauty the only thing i don 39 t like about it is that it can be a little bit too oaky but there us so much to love about this whiskey it 39 s 59 99 where i live light but very full of character endless notes i 39 m a fan  dalwhinnie has a suburb taste i first drank this on my visit to scotland and the distillery also visited oban  just convinced  this was the first dalwhinnie i 39 ve tried so had no expectations i 39 m a big fan of highland park hjarta dark origins are favorites so expected something along the lines of the other highland whisky labels honestly this reminds me of bushmill 39 s honey whisky rather than a scotch really strong honey overtones decent finish not a bad whisky but for the price i feel a little ripped off  tremendous value tremendous taste i love the quote below it has a lovely quot feelin goin doon quot  an old scotsman once said to me quot whisky you drink it not for the taste but for the feelin goin doon quot in this case he was wrong not only has this whisky a fine taste but a lovely quot feelin goin doon quot unfortunately the cost makes it only an occasional treat but thanks for that oh the ladies love it  i think whieky beginners wouln 39 t appreciate the subtletly and quality of this it has a wide range of natural flavours rich honey and crisp purity with a quiet depth properly made properly aged feminine style highland malt  a supremely smooth and easy drinking whisky at first i found it a little basic for my tastes but over time i 39 ve grown to appreciate dalwhinnie 39 s classy understated charm a whisky that would be equally at home in the collection of beginner and experienced drinker alike in my opinion murray 39 s 95 points are fully justified  great scotch whiskey very smooth and enjoyable taste on a six hour drive from louisiana to dallas i asked my daughter whether she had any scotch for a nightcap arrived at 10 30 pm through stormy weather she broke out a full bottle of dalwhinnie and i drank it on the rocks wonderful we consumed 1 2 the bottle with some cheeses as a snack while we talked woke next morning with narry a hangover and feeling great  great whisky for beginners very easy to drink and quite light and smooth some might argue that it 39 s too light and simple for experienced malt drinkers but i disagree especially the nose has an interesting complexity to it and the smooth long finish is very enjoyable  it took me just about 40 years of being married to a scot to acquire a taste for scotch it wasn 39 t until we bought this for our daughter 39 s wedding that i finally decided i did like scotch  great value 15 year favorite smooth and light love the taste of toffee if you prefer sledgehammer fire amp brimstone islay 39 s this is not for you if your tastes run to more subtlety and especially to the more sweet end of single malt welcome to one of the finest for those with a great deal of experience and a more refined palate slowly picking out the various notes and nuances is one of it 39 s many charms  it 39 s a basic young highland malt nothing special but easy to drink  tastes like a blend thin reedy one of those lowlands you just don 39 t taste this doesn 39 t even have the citrus boom headshot of an auchentoshan and its 15 avoid try a bruichladdich or a singleton 12 instead  light but complex nose silky smooth on the palate and an extremely well balanced finale for this price the best  uncomplicated easy drinking this is a whisky for tuesday nights  after xmas new year balvenie the contrast is tough so overrated indeed i first time tasted famous grouse amp my stomach felt fine dalwhinnie gives me burns  nice pretty whisky without excessive splendor luscious honey with heather a hint of apple and a bit smoky in nose malt with fresh grass in first taste fruity clean peat and spice appear after that palpable almond taste as finish nice and smooth finishing glad to meet it at such a tranquil night can 39 t wait to try it again weeks later  love love love it we must take the long view of any scotch ever notice how when you first taste a new brand it may not taste the same several days later the palate environment changes day to day so the true test is the test of time also each batch varies slightly let 39 s be honest dalwhinnie is a great scotch because it has passed the test that matters also if you can discern 18 different flavors in a drink my hat 39 s off to ya  i will buy this one again best smooth single malt  perfect for those wanting to try a single malt neat beautiful apricot and light smokiness smooth flavor adding water takes too much away from the flavor on this one i like to vary what i keep in my cabinet and this is one i will keep for myself and also to serve to guest from now on  i don 39 t get all the flavours in any of the scotches but when lucky i can get some of what they describe in professional tasting notes i get the apples here in nose and palate and has a little smoke which i like a lot of smoke is not my taste but this whisky is very nice one i 39 d be heppy to serve to anyone  a malt of two halves i bought in on offer in tesco 163 10 off for a wee treat after spending a few days working on slate roof in front of a roaring log fire there were strong hints of apples and cinnamon almost like a mulled cider i was mightily impressed with my bargain find but in the absence of a fire it taste rather run of the mill not a bad whiskey just not as special as i first thought but never mind i 39 ll just keep it for those nights in front of the fire  hit by a terrible bug i staggered into tesco s for some cheap generic ibuprofin weak and sweaty i wandered around before drifting spaced out to the booze aisles where beer and wine held no attraction but for the first time in an age i decided upon whiskey which despite having become too heavy for me to stomach brought a fantasy of warmth and comfort to mind a small bottle of dalwhinnie 15 caught my eye and was purchased with little pocket indentation for a single matured malt it was a winner surprisingly light mellow and smooth i drank it straight over ice over two evenings appreciating its lifting of the spirit and warming of the soul  overrated in my opinion ok in the mouth but the finish fails me completely for the same money i can get an entry level macallan or a singleton both far superior  a lovely taste of scotch not daily but a whisky to let go over your tongue and really enjoy on a quiet evening it used to be a must in my drinks cabinet for many years i haven t bought a bottle for three years which i think i should make good  bought this on the strength of reviews and it s appearance in ian buxton s quot 101 whiskies before you die quot pleasant enough on the nose inoffensive but rather bland taste and a weak finish but it is rather at the inexpensive end of the scale so i m not complaining just won t make it my quot go to quot scotch of choice perfectly pleasant and undemanding like a radio 4 afternoon drama  working in a maltings i am developing a taste for whiskey the dalwhinnie 15 is so far the simplest single malt i have had in my limited experience however simple is not bad as a beginner its simplistically is a good way for me to test my nose and palate and so i am really enjoying the experience fruity and slighty smokey nose malty honey almond and spicey on the palate i agree he also needs to get some perspective just because he or she cannot express what he is tasting does not mean the rest of us need to be so limited i have been drinking whiskies for nearly 50 years and usually prefer more smoky peat flavours but find dalwhinnie to be a clean simple dram with lots of character that develops as you savour it you can decide for yourself what particular tastes you find it does vary so much between individuals doesn t it not everything needs to hit you like a mack lorry  this dram reminds me of a first gf delicate and sweet i prefer a dram that is more dominant in smoke and fruit that being said dalwhinnie distillers edition is a great dram for one who is developing a palate for whiskey light taste of apricot peach peat vanilla and light smoke make this an enjoyable introductory single malt previous reviewer needs to relax try and find a dram that is enjoyable enough for you so that you are not so concerned with one another s spelling  i always wonder how many train spotters just say this is great because of it has a reputation in some quarters oh yeah tasting notes what a load of old cobblers nectarine and custard yeah ok and a dash of emerald and smidgen of tiredness please spare me i personally believe a lot of people like this because its inoffensive it has always disappointed me it is very neutral safe ground but crucially for me lacks any real character its just not really worth any critical comment about as dull and bland as it gets there are much better highlands out there oh and why can no one spell definitely properly yes i m talking about you mr previous reviewer  mellow round subltle honey lemon rind tea medium finish with a slightly smoky flavor simple flavors but pleasant and flawless i would definately buy another bottle  best i ve had a little bit of a step up in price but well worth it learning to drink scotch this will keep me coming back  well i had a shot for my 53rd birthday when i was in loch laggon on the 11th may a couple of weeks ago i stopped drinking whiskey because of heart burn but a shot of dalwhinniw 15yr whiskey was so smoove that i was shocked how good it tasted even my wife had a little and she was shocked too amp said quot should i were to buy any scottish whiskey it should be dalwhinnie 15yr whiskey as it is worth the cost quot but wait i have been told 24yr old dalwhinnie whiskey is even better and smoover mr pcd shaw from south africa  a very nice dram which delivers all that the tasting notes claim except i didn t get the gentle smoke they promised however the malt amp fruit are outstanding my only complaint was the 29 year old is so special for the soft notes of heather which are so pleasing unfortunately not so present here but that s ok a nice addition to anyone s collection  one of the classic malts for sure i love islay scotches but i also know what to expect when i choose dalwhinnie and i m never disappointed  please read everybody has a different palate what tastes sweet to you mite taste bland to me so when buying whiskey whisky whatever try something that you think that u wont like u mite just get a nice surprise back to the whiskey smells wonderful but the taste a let down for me drinkable  i was in scotland for the first time in december and developed a taste for the whiskey upon returning to hong kong where i work i bought 13 bottles of various types of scotch 21 and 12 year old balvenie and various others i also brought 6 bottles of 25 year old macallan with me so far i have tried the ones above have quite a few others to test yet but by far the dalwhinnie 15 yr old is the best of the lot and it s a fair bit cheaper than the others to boot this whiskey is outstanding value i will try the others of course but it is likely this will be my chosen one going forward  highland classic an extremely clear expression of what the highlands offer single malt connoisseurs won t find anything new here but that isn t necessarily bad the dalwhinnie 15 is a great back to basics highland that will remind you of what makes a highland single a highland single just enough peat on the palate to remind you you re drinking scotch but mellow and light enough to sip casually when you don t want to work for complex notes have a friend who quot doesn t like scotch quot yeah you do this might not turn them but it s a good weapon to have at hand for those who had a run in with dad s laphroaig 10 year as a teen and think that s all scotch has to offer 8 10 as it shouldn t be missed and no bar is complete without a bottle but not adventurous enough to warrant the final 2 stars  after many years of wondering what was missing form this scotch i finally realized that it is not a bad scotch but not worth the price point especially when the macallan 12 will blow it away in price complexity taste and finish  as a malt maniac of many years there are very few single malts i haven t tried this was one of them and i was bought a bottle for christmas and was so disappointed it s probably the most ordinary malt ive ever had along with the glenlivet 12 the finish is woefully short and the nose and palate remind me of vomit a dreadful dram  excellent dalwhinnie 15 yr is a great scotch to bad they use e 150 colorant and chill filtering but it is still my favorite along with lagavulin 16 yr that has the same process to bad  had far more flavour smooth and fulll of interest this is a great malt at 15 years and 43 highly recomended one of the best  i have not had scotch in a while probably because i enjoyed a good monte cristo no 2 with it so when i gave up cigars the drink seemed to naturally follow i normally enjoy johnny walker blue label as well as glenfiddich 18 year as well as the occasional lagavulin 16 that being said i am delighted that my first dram of scotch in a while was this fine dalwhinnie they say it is not an overly complex scotch but then simple is sometimes the most enjoyable  didn t give me any joy i find it lacks character i drink it when i barbecue if i could use one word to describe this whisky it would be quot meeeh quot  delicious subtle perfection nectar wise the dalwhinnie 15 is 86 proof genius  the taste is great and for that alone it could be put down on a list of amazing whisky however the delivery is something to note too dalwhinnie do a 20cl bottle for approx 163 13 and you can find them on the high street this is ideal for when your nipping round to a mates or on a night away stuck in a hotel room who wants to humph a 163 35 70cl around unnecessarily  as a neanderthalic drinker of nothing but light lagers from south america albeit i massively enjoy the complexity and depth of the world of wine i ve never ever been a lover of anything whisky i had a cocktail in gleneagles called the 80 which contained 15yo dalwhinnie the only reason i bought this was to recreate the 80 at home and boy was i in for a treat for anyone out there with any bad memories of whisky or a fear of trying a single malt this is truly delicious light interesting lingering smooth and gentle insight and introduction into a whole new world of deliciousness now i ve dipped my toes in the water the world of malt is there for the taking try it  a wonderful light flavorful sweet scotch if you are not in the mood for laphoraig try this very nice  dalwhinnie 15 has been on my bucket list for a long time for one reason or another i ve never had a chance to try it i have to say i was disappointed i found it rather bland carrying some subtle syrupy sweetness and a long slightly uncomfortable papery dry finish not every dram can be suited to every palate but i found this one disappointingly characterless  christmas pressure fro daughter loved it best i ve had better then some 17 year old that i ve hadvery smooth very rich one review i read said that this scotch is quot remarkable because of just how unremarkable it is quot and they re right whenever anyone says that they don t like scotch etc i usually have them try some because it just a nice mellow scotch that i can just slowly work my way through  i have been a whiskey drinker for for over forty five years and tasted them all in my humble opinion you will not get any better i am a scot and now will not buy anything else very smooth and won t burn on the way down try it  so smooth first time i ve tried it taste so smooth i have had an obsesion with good wiskeys i started with jack and jim gross but worked my way through many grate burbons up to the pappy had a burbon collection that fill my bar top 100 and i had dabled in scotch trying blended like cutty sark up to jonnie waker blue all i found gross drinkable not enjoy able my friend intoduced me to glenlivet and i was hooked i started trying anything single malt and all were good but this was the best thing i ever put in my mouth i have a collection of scotch 60 and have bars that i try a lot of others and have friends that have collections of themselves but by far this was the smothes best tasting stcotch i have ever tryed it is the only sctoch i can drink neat there is no harshness and no tast of alc just pure clean fawless tast of butterstoch toffee almand chease cake buttery carmel with fresh cut flowers and finish with nutty toffee amazing common with the reviews this is a good whiskey real vaule for money easy to drink not coarse not bitter in ur mouth what a choice of drink 10 10 i just had my first dram of this i find it very subtle and very easy to drink but keep in mind that it lacks the complexity and kick of other malts so it all depends on your mood this is very light and subtle for a second i wondered if this is indeed a scotch or a liqueur of some sort a wonderful experience dalwhinnie will be one of my favorites from now on occasionally though i enjoy something stronger with a little more kick to it  always have a bottle in  you get what you pay for solid single malt  awesome value for money real quality malt i brought this as one of my 1st whisky s was no disappointed lovely colour and smells great my favourites rated 95 and worth it m j harris very good on the top of my list let s face it it s a matter of preference i like beer do i like them all of course i don t it s no different with whisky but some on here take it as a personal affront if a dram has the temerity to affront their personal taste i don t get seduced by price either i reckon if you pay more than 50 quid for a bottle the taste won t get better you re just paying for the exclusivity anyway dalwhinnie 15 would be my desert island malt i have tried hundreds and will keep trying but it s fair to say in my opinion i cant find anything better  ok maybe not just like jameson but definitely tastes irish  tastes like jameson i guess i could leave it at a friends house or mix it with ginger ale not worth the price  un whisky non whisky senza personalit 224  un whisky non whisky senza personalit 224  by comparison to other whiskeys this has in my opinion a very gentle yet full flavour honestly i dont know a lot about whiskeys but i have tasted a lot of expencive ones and this is definetly one of my favourites  the first and still the best malt i ve ever tasted such an excellent starter malt and one you ll keep coming back to if only to remind yourself of the bencmark you set others malts just brilliant want to like whisky try this then embark on your journey but don t forget your roots  it is called quot the gentle spirit quot for a good reason i found quite tasty with a light smokiness that was balanced with a honey like sweetness it is relatively smooth to drink straight and i prefer this one without ice or a splash of water adding a bit of water makes it softer still for a relaxing drink after supper it is reliable when you re not after a punch of flavor smoke  один из моей любимой 6 ки классик молт чемпион хайленда сначала нотки хереса потом сладость верескового мёда как у an cnoc 12 просто симфония вкуса шедевр солодового виски один из немногих виски что считаются с десертами translation using google translate one of my favorite 6s classic malt highland champion first notes of sherry then heather honey sweetness like an cnoc 12 just a symphony of taste a masterpiece of malt whiskey one of the few temples that are considered the dessert  i really like dalwhinnie 15 not only for the smoothness but because of its unpretentious simplicity and because that what it does it does well on all accounts the cost is good the nose is lovely the taste is smooth and the finish gently fades in a way i immediately want to have another sip straight away  introduced to this initially through my mum her favourite whisky and her dads as well will always have an important place for me and is a classic that holds a dignified and deserved place in the world of whisky and on many a shelf nose wonderfully aromatic pears apple blossom apple almond peach i could go on honeysuckle and honeyed apricots with a hint of spice and a gentle almost elusive whiff of peat palate cereal sweetness toasted oak and more of those floral almond and apricot notes melts into honey and spice with a thread of peat deftly woven in finish resolves into more spice than sweetness becoming more nutty but maintaining the honey notes toasted malt and a long lingering warmth  sent a bottle to my father in spain his palate is not whisky educated he can t afford buying scottish whisky or any here again he noticed the smoothness of it and the flavour in his language it means real good he got 2 samples of blanton bourbon i sent after reading the reviews he said blanton burned his mouth too happy he forgot it all with 15 years velvety dahlwhinnie  if you like a lighter whisky you can do better the only thing letting this down is its finish a little on the harsh side i would really rate tomartin or tormore for a or subtle finish  very good stuff recommended the chaps at master of malt have this one pegged perfectly very aromatic nose lots of fruit and light smoke the palate has a lot of walnut and spice but it s not overpowering and the finish goes on forever i love this one definitely one of the better light single malts in its price range  a very smooth and delicate one one of my favorites soft on the tongue but sofisticated on taste  spectacular as whisky and so smooth and fine that i don t need any cognac or brandy  nose honey salted butter touch of smoke toasted walnutstaste the softest bite followed by honey caramel applefinish long vanilla marmalade more honey walnutsa classic and great value for the money  i set down strong drink nearly 40 years ago but missed my scotch recently i decided to return and wanted to try a traditional single malt absolutely loved it perfect to the nose palate and resonance for me i might shop a bit more but i m sure i ll keep coming back to dalwhinnie 15  a buddy of mine and i have been slowly working our way through all the different single malts at a local store and so far this is the winner i was surprised a 15 year old could taste this smooth but it does really a beautiful scotch at any price  i don t concider myself a connoisseur of fine whiskies but i know what i like and this is my favorite good to the nose gentle over the tongue easy finish i love it if there is something better poor me a wee glass  i bought a bottle of this over the christmas holidays for only 25 pounds it truly is wonderful stuff nose vanilla toffee marmalade marzipan apricot jam creamy oak egg custard tarts and just a whiff of smoke taste goes from a wonderful rich double cream with fresh walnuts into a rich apricot conserve almond like dry smokey ending with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg this is wonderful stuff if you see it on offer at a supermarket or available you owe it to yourself to buy some truly delicious stuff  in this price range i prefer the talisker 10 year the laphoaig quarter cask glen garioch 12 year or slightly more especially ardbeg uigeadail the tasting notes from the chaps at master of malt will bias you to imagine a sweeter whisky but i find it spicier though it does initally hit you as sweeter you must experience it somehow perhaps a shot in a bar somewhere because it is a classic scotch but i think there are better finds if you want a whole bottle of something  a perfect age for this single malt you have to commend diageo here for allowing that extra few years to mature it really shows and if this was bottle at 12 years it would not be of the same quality but it is priced as a 12 year old one of the cheapest 15 year olds you will find and it is stunning the nose is tropical matly tons of honey apple peels toffee in fact the master of malt tasting notes are pretty much spot on this whisky is consistent through bottlings and at 43 offers that little extra richness that most 40 malts do not highly recommended at this price a great stepping stone from 12 year olds to 17 18 year olds if you like this try the more complex hibiki 17 year old which is quite similar in nose and much more complex in taste  bought two bottles of dalwhinnie but don t drink scotch so will i i have to be a william wallaceto delve into the taste of scotch only and very rarely drink spiritsalfie t as a lover of the single malts this is the one i always come back to as my standard to rate against there is better and lesser but dalwhinnie is a great measuring stick but as i say there are no bad scotches just ones thar aren t as good as others  x i just got lucky in picking this one up i was buying a friend a bottle of macallan 18 and wanted to grab something for myself it s easy to pay top dollar for excellence but just like in buying wines i decided to walk away from all my top dollar favorites and venture over into the under marketed 15 amp 18 year section in an effort to discover a new and more practical favorite this is it the nose which is fruit a hint of smoke and what i thought was carmel but i guess is honey or custard just when you think it is about to bite you it backs off and is smooth with a sugary but clean finish it s a good one while sitting by the fire  this is a nice whiskey especially for the price last one i bought was 163 28 in a supermarket its just i have others i favor more such as tomintoul 14yr or 12yr portwood finish though this makes a good collection filler and everyday whisky if you drink a lot of whisky this can seem somewhat bland and boring almost  herr schnelli hat mich 252 berzeugt dalwhinnie 15 year old is the best  fantastic nose very pleasant lingering taste my staple will always be talisker but this is a very welcome break  just bought my first bottle of the dalwhinnie 15 and am enjoying my first dram immensely very smooth and as others have said it is very quot floral quot very nice  wasn t that impressed read the reviews on here and thought i d buy a bottle as it was on special offer at the super market so far my favourites are talisker 10 singleton and laphroaig this in my opinion just couldn t compete  hunajainen tuoksu pehmeä makumaailma erityisen pehmeästä viskistä pitävälle must ostos  yes i like dalwhinnie 15 very nice and not too complicated for the beginner i often start new whisky drinkers off on this as it is so smooth not my favorite but damn close for regular drinking struth  extraordinarily smooth it does taste soft in the sense of not overpowering any particular dimension but has exceptional balance and range that linger on the palette you have to spend a lot more money to get anything even marginally better clearly a highland if that is your taste this is an exceptional example of that genre at a very very fair price  first tasted this at my first malt tasting session and preferred it to the others tried as it was the smoothest of the bunch having been hooked on malts since that session i have found a only a few that suit my taste buds better dam good that like got my taste for whiskey back with this  this is a nice creamy honeyed dram always a reliable choice  maybe it s just me being lucky with other whiskys but i expected more from this age of malt don t get me wrong it s a good dram but i was glad that i bought a taster before deciding to buy the bottle as it s not quite for me i guess this is a good advert for the samples offered by master of malt  i adore this whiskey i was sold on the first sip if you like this you ll also love the distillers editions imagine you re favorite thing and then they go and alter it slightly so you can have 2 favorite things thats the distillers editions i have tried the 1992 and 1995 both are outstanding enjoy  be patient with this one warm it your hands in a cognac snifter and enjoy the aromas for a couple minutes to unlock the flavors and reduce the burn after 2 or 3 slow delightful sips the burn reduces unlocking more subtle flavors nothing unpleasant at all on the back end a fine choice for the price  this is the softest whisky i have ever had lets get this straight by soft i do not mean this word negatively by this i mean it is gentle and smooth it is not overpowering on the tongue but still complex beautiful and rounded in nose taste and finish i wish i had tried earlier as its a great starting point and reference point this is one i will always keep going beck to and one i would buy anyone as a present because its not one that could cause any dissatisfaction  this is an excellnt malt wonderful on the palate and a smooth finish if someone wanted me to introduce them to whisky this is one i would pick i really don t know how one could fail to enjoy it visited the distillery after having had a couple of bottles over the years a fantastic place to visit and a wonderful whisky some of the flavours are a little confused mid palate but the warm sharp honey finish is excellent in my mind a perfect whisky to drink having walked in from walking on a freezing cold night sitting by a fire or radiator adam  this whisky has amazing flavours for how young it is and for the price too for people who hate scotch i d recommend this hands down  dalwhinnie 15 year old is the best value malt currently on the market if anyone says they don t like whisky they should try this  can t say its the best i ever had however it is for the money pretty darn nice neat with a water back smooth and great sipping with a cigar  was offered many whiskeys for my 65th birthday and i chose this one because it is the best i have ever drunk a close second is brewed in tain say no more  after many fore s into the world of whisky and a long and disappointing search to find a single malt that hits the spot i was finally introduced to dalwhinnie as a 50th birthday present by a friend who obviously knows his whiskies have to say that this scotch is a delight to drink and will without doubt become my first choice easy to drink smooth and uncomplicated perfect  this was a disapointing one for me it wasn t particularly bad but it was just bland and tasted branded at fifty bucks a bottle i wish i would have tried somthing else my most unsatisfying buy in awhile  for years i try drinking scotch both blended and single malt and had reached the opinion that i was not a scotch drinker then came my first shot of dalwhinnie i now only drink scotch although i have tried over 100 different scotches dalwhinnie is and will remain my first choice there is nothing that compares to it s wonderful taste i will admit that i try others and some very expensive single malts but have yet to find another i like as much  i tried this 15 and found it smooth on the nose with spirit and sweetness and balanced floral like crysthymums don t believed i typed that but sharp fragrant and floral it is plus medium flavours of salt smoke and sweet tastes of vanilla and honey i tried tasting laphroig 10 and bowmore legend after a dram of this and they seemed a bit brash and rough by comparison different style i know but islay malts have maybe distracted many from other malts this is a good dram it includes lots of flavours in a subtle way withought being light and legless re review manuka honey  cannot seriousley be bettered my last bottle just 23 00 from my local supermarket  from the highest distillery in scotland this malt remains a marvel always classy never overpowering with overtones of apples pears orange peel and honey the slightest of smoke and a nutty finish completes the experience well worth a visit and just off the main road to the highlands  bought this a few weeks ago i wish i d discovered it earlier this is a very easy to drink whisky a gentle sweetness on the finish and a nose with a hint of creamy toffee the only reason i have not given it 10 is because i have many whisky drinking years in front of me and want to keep seeking 10 
1854.0, a well rounded islay whisky a bit smokey a bit medicinal but doesn 39 t really have a prominent character of its own nice to drink  too strong notes does not come out i think i wasted my money buying 2 x 75 cl somehow i feel 12 yo does not taste like this just had a glass of bowmore 12 year old waste of 26 pounds at tesco definitely wouldn 39 t recommend it i find this better then laphroaig 10 ardbeg 10 is still better than both  not very good sorry not for me tcp comes to mindthere is a chemical kind of after taste to me im not into smoky whisky tried this based on some good reviews to try something new there are definately vanilla honey and other nice elements but they are overpowered by the smokiness and chemical taste i got for me anyway  a lovely bold and rounded whisky a strong smell of oak smoke and vanilla and honey hints a great smoky taste with a pleasant warm after taste  absolutely delicious in an easy drinking and sufficiently complex way lemon cheesecake notes with subtle smoke and peat a lovely everyday dram  bowmore 12 captures the essence of the typical smoky whisky that is characteristic of scotland 39 s most famous island of islay softer smoke dark fruits caramel hints of peat and vanilla notes with barrel char makes this a great dram for the price  a beautiful dram all round it is ridiculously smooth it easily puts to shame many 15yo and 18yo s it s by no means a peat monster like a laphroiag the smokiness is moderate but still imparts a lasting impression truly one of the best whiskies in its class that puts many much more expensive bottles to shame an absolute steal when on deal  as an old moonshiner i m not that easily fooled by certain flavored liqours hipster whisky s the new japanese influenced bowmoore is a tragedy while this old original is a treashure just as a whisky should be full bodyed smoky and balanced still after many years i ll come back to this one as one of my favorites and at the same time it is a good beginners whisky  smokiness was charcoal and not the pleasant wood smokiness of older bowmore or ardbeg and certainly miles away from a lagavulin the oily mouthfeel on the palate is also interesting but not particularly pleasant aromas and flavors of orange and honey are present overall this is a disappointing bottle from an otherwise quality producer  totally support a scotsman 39 s view below this is a great whisky for the common man ok so it 39 s not going to stand up to finer whiskies of greater strength and smaller batch but it is better than most in its price range especially if you pick it up discounted this 12 year old is streets ahead of your glenlivits highland parks and glenmorangies ect a lot of poor reviews seem to be unfair in my humble working class scottish opinion it is what it is a great honest affordable dram for the workers of the world  this islay gem has a tempered peaty note that balances well with the malty toffee and woody nuances that satisfy through and through at this price point the age and complexity make it a great experience slange var  i have to say this is one of the worst i 39 ve had from islay bought in on offer at 163 25 and it just sits on the shelf it 39 s not a terrible whisky but i wouldn 39 t pay full price for it when for a few quid more you can get a caol ila or ardbeg it has a strange off taste i can 39 t quite describe and is a bit watery  this is a great whisky for the common man ok so it 39 s not going to stand up to finer whiskies of greater strength and smaller batch but it is better than most in its price range especially if you pick it up discounted this 12 year old is streets ahead of your glenlivits highland parks and glenmorangies ect a lot of poor reviews seem to be unfair in my humble working class scottish opinion it is what it is a great honest affordable dram for the workers of the world  i was impressed mixed with a drop of tap water it compared very well with much pricier malts of the same vintage  well rounded islay scotch smoke peat sweet grass heather deeply satisfying  this is quite strange very strong citrus and a strange taste i just moved from a bowmore no1 which inloce and this is totally different it s noticeably different from the others islay malts i agree with the other comments of an oily taste don t think i ll bother with this again  i never really got into single malts especially with a bit of smoke in them i 39 m more of a bourbon guy but this was surprisingly good tried this at my friends place and enjoyed it quite a lot not too much smoke could actually have been a bit more in it but still a really solid single malt especially for 40 bucks where i live i usually drink speysides and love the sherry and port finished whisky 39 s picked this up for 33 us on a whim this is an amazing whisky to start a journey away from speyside and highland towards islay not overly in your face but for me a wonderful lingering taste of smokes almonds  i know whisky is subjective but i struggle to understand how the dreadful old pulteney or glenlivet 12 can average 4 5 stars and this 3 5 for me this is streets ahead not as strong as ardbeg or laphroig for smoke and peat but certainly has its own distinctiveness for an islay often can be snapped up for 163 26 this a must have giving it 5 stars just to level up some of the previous reviews  its actually not bad if not wonderful in sa its also well priced always been a bit puzzled as to why ralfy who i rate hates the stuff but i buy the odd bottle its no ardberg 10 though  highland park was my tipple of choice next came laphroaig talisker and lagavulin then i discovered bowmore 12 yo and it has the best characteristics of each of them it 39 s now my first choice of single malt  lovely islay whisky just a drop of water is all you need  very disappointing it tastes like a mix of sweet oily peaty islay and a low quality whisky no body no balance sharp unpleasant burn in palate at first it 180 s truly great in the nose but after you taste it greatness disappears immediately very lame aftertaste a bit like the whisky would turned suddenly into a water difficult to explain i 180 m not a native english speaker but the taste disappears soon not even near for example ardbeg 10 or laphroaig qc i 180 m quite sure that this whisky suffers much because of chill filtration 12 years old really  i ve tried many bottles of bowmore 12 and my tasting notes were always somewhat different but the conclusion was always unsatisfying there is something to this islay that is just not on par with other islays sometimes its too sweet and unbalanced other times i notice a very unpleasant plasticy smoke or taste unlike wood or charcoal smoke in other peated islays it s a more affordable islay here in canada and i would love to like it but unfortunately i find it simply unpleasant to the point i can t finish a bottle something that would never happen with laphroig ardbeg or lagavulin  a very easy drinker smells great it 39 s light and sweet but still packs plenty of flavour  my favorite among the cheaper islays my go to whisky so rounded and balanced but still enough body for a lagavulin fan fantastic whisky great balance and wonderfully peated easily one of the best islay whiskies i 39 ve tasted  what a lovely dram she is absolutely bang on the button for a beginners whiskey as we know we whiskey drinkers know we all have to work a little to enjoy the whiskey as a drink itself if you ar dipping your toe into the world of whiskey then this is a very fine malt tae get ye started on this amazing journey enjoy bye an open fire and yer good tae go a great whisky for a the non peat lovers to explore a balanced rounded scotch it suits some occasions perfectly  i laugh at some reviews a different meal or the amount left in a bottle can effect the taste of any whiskey i opened this bottle tonight and it 39 s my new favourite over lagavulin 16 and laphroaig 10 its just the right amount of peat it is light bodied and slippery lovely after taste  i am a very olde fart third generation canadian grandfather was the first born here in 1885 we hail from scotland i don 39 t care what the snobs say this is my uisge beatha give me a dram a piper and i am almost home  quite thin and lacks character speyburn which is less than half the price in the us is comparable to this 50 whiskey  i have tried many bowmore ages and find this to be my favourite it has a smoky finish which gives way through ice cube to a beautiful almost sweet raisin taste with a washed pear treat the best i have tasted in my short time of relishing my taste for scotland 39 s best  there are an enormous amount of better whiskies available for the same price or a few quid extra it 39 s still a good introduction to peat as it 39 s not got anything overpowering except the overshadowing taste of old cigar ash in stead of pleasant wood or meat smoke but it 39 s an overall disappointing one  a great intro for islay neophytes if you really like this then you may be ripe for some even more intense islay offerings from the bowmore line and others temper with water sparingly as it takes very little to expose bowmore 12 39 s many delights and only a little more to push it over the edge into dishwater a great whiskey to have handy for guests offering a pleasent intestity and depth of flavour at reasonable cost  very very weak it mentions peat smokiness but there 39 s almost nothing in my bottle it strangely has almost no scent just a bit lemony you take a sip expect some flavour get nothing wait a little while and nothing arrives no particular whiskey flavour just a faint lemon taste  still good but seems to have toned down the peat a really enjoyable malt and for the price very good too nice and rich peaty though not in the lagavulin league of peatiness warming yet exciting  ok here goes as a big fan of peated smoky scotch whisky i find this to be an excellent dram and excellent value bowmore 12 is a fantastic way to introduce those with a shy palate to peated single malt overall a smooth whisky with mild smoky peat flavour its great neat and also really good with sofa or mixed into a rusty nail for 48 at superstore in alberta i would take this over a glenfiddich 12 or glenlivet 12 any day  pleasant and lively on the palate 12 it is and given time it will be the ambrosia you asked for  very enjoyable and easy drinking to me it feels like a bit of a cross between a sweeter highland style and an islay well balanced would be so much better bottled a few extra percent higher but you know what i found is a nice trick throw a few drops of something massive like ardbeg uigeadail into your glass along with the bowmore to make your own blend you end up with something very complex yet super drinkable also in china where i am this is available for around 20 quid sterling not bad value at all though admittedly for not much more you could get laphroaig quarter cask a more interesting malt but also not as quaffable  well it is not bad a kind of fruity with some gentle peat but not great at all drinkable obviously will please your none whisky drinker friends just ok actually  good example of islay flavor at a reasonable price more of the floral and sweet character of a decent speyside than say laphroig which seems much more to be the essence of peat smoke kind of a poor man 39 s lagavulin maybe with that broader flavor profile above the smoke i like it at the price  usually love this but was very spirity and peatiness almost totally gone half way down the bottle can only assume it was a bad batch as bottle only opened 3 weeks and stored correctly peaty and smokey but not overwhelming at all lots of flavors come out as you sip it delicious on a fall night by the fire you can t go wrong with this at this price love this scotch  very well balanced smooth with some sweetness and soft peated finish a real easy sipper and will be replaced quickly due to its value for money  i 39 m a fan of many of the classic islay whiskeys in the below 150 range bowmore strikes me as a terrific bargain granted not for the intense peat appreciator this whiskey is balanced flavorful not simple minded and eminently drinkable i 39 m amazed at the harsh reviews i 39 m not a novice to good whiskey bowmore will become standard fare  a lovely medium peated dram for a winters evening smooth and fruity pleasing to the palate as someone who enjoys other flavour in whisky than simply peat i really enjoyed it a deep and rich whisky with plenty of peat and fruit notes quite unique actually  drinking scotch is like art you may not know what the experts and connisseurs think but know what i don 39 t care i like it and one of my favorite evening pastimes great scotch  a great value standard islay malt it lacks finesse and complexity but for the price it is a reasonable buy it has been discounted in the uk recently so there are good buying opportunities  recently had a bottle of bowmore no1 and very nice too noticed the 12 year old had discounted heavily so purchased a bottle very nice too as the sun rises after 6 nightshifts have had laphroig lagavuilin and of course ardbeg this is very mellow  i unfortunately paid 57 plus tax for this in my area i was debating between trying this or ardbeg ueigedal boy do i feel like an idiot there are so many better options in and under this price range it 39 s okay but it lacks body i agree with other reviews that it 39 s thin and the smoke is artificial tasting it 39 s just not that interesting and i get heartburn after drinking this almost every time not so with other good whisky lagavulin 16 is a wonderful islay try that if you haven 39 t and you like peat this tastes like a dollar store generic version of an islay whisky i read one glowing review about this somewhere last time i 39 ll trust an online opinion i should 39 ve read more reviews now i have to either drink it and try to like it more or give it away  didn 39 t much like it at first the smoky peat tasted too much like liquid smoke came back to it about a week later and those flavours seemed less pronounced not a bad bottle but i won 39 t be going back to the well first single malt i drank in years better than what i drank years ago i normally drink beer or bourbon stuff the majority here looks down upon as for this whisky 39 s the taste is like mentioned on the bottle which is awesome regarding the heavy smokey taste at first i agree with the reviewer before me lots of people with no taste seek that in whiskey  if you are completely new to peated whisky you have no business reviewing this i am so tired of seeing people say they don t like this and they give it a bad rating and say acquired taste if you haven t acquired the taste of peat then you have no business reviewing it  one of the best 12yr malts on the market subtle peaty notes in aroma and taste which is ideal for the un schooled beginner in islay whisky 39 s a great first buy quality colour for the age and smooth for a peat malt i compare this to bunnahabhain 39 s 12yr although the latter is not for the faint off heart i give 4 stars five would need it to be stronger on the peat and lasting slightly longer on the palate  watery thin harsh 56 99 on sale 3 00 off for xmass here in b c i 39 ll stay with entry level mcclelland 39 s islay and 10 00 cheaper heavier smoky salt air it is the taste of the island and more a sailor 39 s brew i 39 m looking for more smoke salt and smoothness as i get older tried them all and go back to the bottom to get any taste at all and live with the harshness to get the taste and bouquet it seems the more you age this drink the more it tastes like canadian rye w v williams vancouver island british columbia canada  so much smoke not for the faint of heart very nice to finish  i was fortunate enough to get a bottle of this locally for 163 20 must have been an error i reviewed this positively a couple of years ago and this bottle did not disappoint ok so it 39 s not one of the south of the island peaty monsters but the islay trademark peat is still there just more subtly which isn 39 t always a bad thing it 39 s very smooth and perilously easy to drink and there 39 s a beautiful floral lavender finish well i think so anyway  feels a bit unbalanced on the palate fruity and light initially then smoke takes over but the finish feels watered down i find caol ila 12 to be quite a lot better  i m no scholar nor maker of single malt scotch but i ve managed to consume my fair share of the finer 1 s and this is by far my worst experience in the 12 yr old or older scotch s i ve ever had definitely an aquiared taste good but lacks and is boring bowmore needs to bring this up to a minimum of 45 bowmore continues to hurt themselves by bottling at 40 the quot light peat quot dominates the cask and spirit influences because of the lack of proof the nose is beautiful but it falls apart on the palate best value of all the islay single malts i have tried excellent balance  what a beautiful whisky my first islay and i am really really pleased with it the smoke is not overpowering it is a smooth and well rounded product no extremes but complex enough to want you to go back to it i got some sweet notes with first tasting then saltiness with the second one the empty glass was smelling earthily then wet peat into a medicinal ointment like smell i am very satisfied with the whole experience  the bowmore 12 is a fine scotch whisky and i wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to beginners it s not as smokey as others of the region and it has a very balanced finish it s good to drink neat because it isn t as harsh on the tongue at the beginning as some i ve had possibly due to it only being 40 i keep this whisky available for when friends come over  do you enjoy the smell of a forest fire ever wondered what it 39 d taste like in liquid form well here you go alternatively if you 39 d like to save a few bucks buy yourself a bottle of liquid smoke then mix it in with some cheap scotch to be fair glenfiddich india pale ale is my usual go to but thought to venture out for once i just didn 39 t realize that venturing out would mean i 39 d find myself in the middle of a california wildfire with a thick layer of soot coating my tongue and cheeks  this dram is a little portrayl of what all the islay bottlings feature on a smaller scale unlike the giants of laphroaig lagavulin and ardbeg bowmore holds its own with hints of islay smoke peat sweet and savory palette at a much smaller price my everyday go to scotch repeat summary title here  simply put this dram captures a little bit of what all islay scotches are noted for peat medicinal notes smoke and the sweet and savory long finish i say a quot little bit quot because unlike bottlings from the big islay distilleries ie laphroaig lagavulin and ardbeg bowmore 12 is a gentler animal it is much tamer on the palette and on the wallet this is the islay scotch i would first introduce to friends before a taste of other giants it is my everyday go to scotch an excellent scotch from the oldest distillary in islay they know what they are doing slangevar  bowmore was one of my first islay whiskies since then i 39 ve been to islay spent nights in bowmore and tried them all this is a distinctive islay whisky that among my others always has my heart  i like peat monsters such as the laphroaig quarter cask and pretty much every other laphroaig too compared to those this is sort of a milquetoast islay i keep it in my collection because sometimes i don 39 t want such an aggressive charcoal burned house finish the bowmore 12 is much more mild while retaining some of the same flavor notes it 39 s not my everyday drink but it has a place  this was my first bottle for smoky and peaty whisky and i really loved islay every since the smokiness is very light and tasty i got citrus sweet and of course light smoke at the end now inhave tried bowmore 15 laga 16 and ardbeg i am more into the big smoky drams i would recommend this one to anybody who wants to try smoky whisky  beautiful scotch very palatable taste wife likes it too  along with johnnie walker red label the two worst whiskies i 39 ve ever had tastes of burnt plastic horrible stuff i 39 m guessing these peaty whiskies are an acquired taste certainly not for me  received this bottle as a gift now it is my favourite scotch slight medicinal flavour typical of isley scotch sweet apples and caramel notes with a complexity of much more expensive single malts from the region caoll ila meets highland park here awesome dram  this is really is a delicious single malt flavors of woody toasted oak with a subtle infusion of peat fresh fruit and marzipan in the background are noteworthy may not be the right for those who dislike a quality peated dram with a rubbery note they should stick to sweeter less complex whisky which they can enjoy like a fine port and avoid upset tummies cheers  really good isley lots of depth smoke and peat daily drinker for sure  very weird tasting single malt i feel like i just tried to chew burned rubber soaked in iodine seriously very unique and unforgettable experience in a negative way won 39 t buy this again a staple in the cabinet can be enjoyed by those who are not peat fans has a fantastic maritime taste sea spray honey and vanilla with a small peat heat finish would definitely recommend but would value the whisky at 163 25  nice beginning and nice finish no overwhelming smoke or iodine long finish at 40 a bit thin so avoid water  before drinking this whisky i didn 39 t really like whisky now i do  the whiskey that was used to launch of carrier queen elizabeth in 04jul 2014  i 39 m on a quest to find a peaty scotch that i enjoy and this was a wonderful experience the mild peaty smokiness provides a perfect finish will absolutely drink again  very pleasantly surprised by this one i initially bypassed it choosing numerous other malts even though it was lower priced and readily available after i finally got to taste it i took to it right away i really like the nose and it has a nicely balanced and interesting mixture of flavours from arrival through the to the finish it just so happens to have the right combination for me and 204 i have since gone back for a second and third bottle i have ardbeg laphroig abelour benromach and other single malts in my collection but with its lower price and lower pedigree bowmore 12 is my favourite i hope it can maintain its quality and price if you like a bit of smoke with honey vanilla and zest give it a try it might be the one for you pei canada  the price does not justify this whisky  my first smokie first taste confused me a bit but after 2 3 glasses understood what it was about after experimenting a bit with other smokies beyond its price range i decided that this was the thing for me the only whiskey i buy from duty frees when i 39 m on the road  this is one of the best smokies i 39 ve tried in it 39 s price range it 39 s complex in how the flavours unfold and release on the palette smooth amber followed by sweet heather honey complimented by a slight citrus zing then a peaty smokiness that doesn 39 t steal form the prior the key though is how wonderfully balanced all the notes work together the overall tone feels deep and complex just an absolute magical pleasure to drink i must admit i have bias to the notes in this one which is in partly why i love it so much but the overall balanced and complex nature to which it delivers to the palette really brings it home as an absolute winner for me really is a love and for any whisky drinker who loves a smoky where the smoke doest steal the show but works in balanced accompaniment with the rest of the notes it 39 s must try  i 39 ve drank bowmore 12 over the course of the last 18 years back in the days when jim mcewan was in charge releases from 12 years and over it was different more salty briny pungent and it was also different before him i 39 ve had amazing bowmore 12 15 18 i 39 ve had pretty normal ones then tonight i went to the liquor store to buy a bourbon and left with a bowmore 12 which was on sale tell me about incentives i thought quot oh well it 39 s going to be ok quot but no i was simply amazed by the highest quality of this batch dark honey citrus notes long with lingering peat smoke ash heather oak sea salt leather after taste i was like quot wow wtf did happen with this new batch quot then i went to read a few comments here to see if there would be such delights recently online but no when you read through the comments some say it 39 s great some say it 39 s disappointing i think it 39 s the problem with the quot whole quot whisky industry drinkers are not educated to learn batches differ sometimes greatly from one another this is not beer vodka or gin this is whisky no two barrels are alike the climate changes from year to year the position of the barrel in the warehouse will influence the taste of whisky etc bottomline you can 39 t replicate the same exact taste over and over again impossible yet we live in a marketing world where folks believe they will get the exact same tasting profile from bottling of different years this is insanity ignorance look at older pre 1990 39 s macallan 39 s long luxurious then 2000 39 s were more disappointing then today they 39 ve dropped altogether the age statement and surf on the brand 39 s reputation and they are tripling production think whisky taste the same year over year think again you might fall on a stellar batch like you might fall on a disappointing batch like wine or anything vintage give it a try year over year you never know stuff gets better stuff gets worse unfortunately we live in the dark ages when it comes to whisky i don 39 t know which batch of bowmore 12 i 39 m drinking tonight but it 39 s downright amazing better than the ones i 39 ve had last year or before eddie macaffer current master distiller is retiring soon after over 30 years working at the distillery and expect more change in the taste of bowmore in the years to come like any other whisky brands in the end tonight right here right now regardless of the low price i 39 ve paid the complexity and balance found here is phenomenal  i didn 39 t give a rating because this is my first experience with an islay i 39 m more of a bourbon fan but i do enjoy single malts typically those that are finished i read quite a few posts about which islay to try first so i wouldn 39 t be consumed by smoke i 39 d have to say that this was a great starting point the smoke ash is there but it 39 s definitely not overpowering and once i got used to it i was able to grab some citrus notes palate was quite similar to the nose citrus with a salty smoked ham note the finish was warm and nice and long i 39 m intrigued and will continue to taste this whisky  newer releases are losing the cloying speyside garishness that spoiled them for the past six or so years they seem to be harkening back to bowmores old glory somewhat more smoke and more complexity is what this ob needs along with three percent more umph 40 percent makes it a bit flat and simple if you ask me  my girlfriend bought me a bottle of glenfiddich and a bottle of bowmore 12 for christmas at first i thought smoky whiskies weren 39 t my thing but i was wrong although i do not know much about whisky yet i must say that the bowmore 12 is the best whisky i have ever drank i love the sweet and smoky side of this whisky i can 39 t wait to be done drinking my bottle of glenfiddich 12 to concentrate a bit more on the bowmore  i really like this new to whiskey tastes i love gin from islay the botanist and saw this option from islay i love knappogue from ireland and this is completely different i do taste peat with sone floral notes and a bit of bite wish bartenders would understand what a really warm glass does to open up these beautiful notes  lots of subtle flavours combining with enough peat to create a very well balanced and enjoyable dram would buy again  nose presents a burst of islay sea breeze and iodine overtones not as much citrus fruit and honey as described by the distiller 39 s notes on the box although such flavours become somewhat noticeable towards the throat the palate moves away from an initial saltiness towards a honeyed floral state the whisky then transitions into a long smooth delightfully peaty finish overall good value but not peaty enough for those who enough far more phenolic drams such as laphroaig and caol ila  compared to the 18 year this is a little bit rough but for the price yes please i 39 ve tasted both 12 year 15 darkest and the 18 year old this dram takes the 2nd place  great wee dram could take on any other single malt from islay love how it moves from sweet to smoke  for me the bowmore 12 doesn 39 t seem to be able to make up its mind what it wants to be it doesn 39 t know if it wants to be a peaty islay or a speyside if it were more lightly peated the sweet honeyed citrus notes wouldn 39 t be overshadowed and if it were more highly peated the background sweetness would be a nicer contrast nest time i want some of this i 39 ll mix a little glenlivet 12 with some laph 10  big disappointment not really smokey or peaty nose very sweet reminding low quality spirits honey maybe somebody said paraffin palate is were the peat and smoke comes in but it is overwhelmed by the excessive sweetnesess very lite and fast vanishing finish i completely disliked this whiskey especially the nose i actually tried to sip it with my nose closed as i wright this i switched to laphroig 10 and my god these two dwell in different universes i honestly do not understand how someone can mention them in the same sentence  this dram was one of the best about 3 4 years ago what happened it used to have a super long iodine finish now it is just average something has changed bowmore better get this sorted loyal customers are noticing  just doesn 39 t compare to a typical islay less of everything sadly likely makes a good introduction to islay but why not just jump into the pool  this one is a bit hard for me to pin down it 39 s got a bonfire nose and initial taste but that quickly fades into a smoother only somewhat smokey but overall pleasant finish the less time between sips the quicker this occurs it 39 s a fun one but i don 39 t know that i 39 ll be buying another bottle any time soon  i can 39 t figure this whisky out on my first pour i would have described the flavor as quot stagnant seawater and varnish with an overpowering hint of sweatsock quot i am a fan of islay whisky but i put this bottle away and vowed not to allow it near my lips again a few short weeks later i was persuaded to try it again the second tasting was completely different a balanced honey sweetness a bit oily but not unpleasant and that lovely smoky finish a third taste and even more new flavors were in the mix butterscotch and citrus and oddly the quot sweatsock quot was back again too although not as overpowering tasted again and salty and sweet flavors come to the fore followed by smoke this bottle of bowmore 12 yo may be the most mystifying and thoroughly entertaining bottle of whisky i 39 ve ever had  discovered islay single malts about a year ago absolutely love the bowmore 12 2 oz every night whether i need it or not with a small splash of water dave in nova scotia smoked apple juice theme seems to be bowmore trademark too light on palate and seriously underpowered at 40 i like islay malts but this one doesn 39 t impress me  if this was from a fancy name distillery it would be rated much higher maybe some of the fancier name products are better maybe but almost certainly not for the price  i usually like whiskey but this brand is terrible i have asked my husband wether it could be a bad batch  what i most like about this whisky is the quality of the spirit beneath the soft smoke you have the perfect coastal whisky briney citrusy salty with the addition of some sherry character nice and long ending no bitterness i would love to find a whisky like this but without smoke i tried old pulteney and i like it but its different i know bowmore did get a good amount of flak in the past for uneven quality but i find this one superb for the price  no water just neat i like bestbthatvthere is no 2nd flavor sm like this  so i bought this at my local liquor store the other day because they had run out of port charlotte and actually turned out to be a good buy not as smoky as id hoped but still satisfies my need for peat with some nice honey citrus and vanilla notes as well as has that sea salt i love all in all not bad would probably buy this again once i have tried everything i can  this is a islay scotch that isn 39 t quite an islay scotch it 39 s not that peaty it 39 s rather sweet and it 39 s surprisingly smooth at 40 in fact it 39 s too smooth so don 39 t add water it will kill your drink nose is a bit smokey a pit peat a bit citric too mouthfeel is very silky it misses punch a bit smoke salt lemon is there i recon this is a good one to use at a beginners tasting event and put it after the speysides but before the big islay guns finish is rather short but pretty ok for a young one it 39 s no match for the almost double priced 15 yo bowmore but at this price range this is a top ten finish  you like smoke and peat this one is really good no medicinal note small hint of fruit bold and smoky scotch one of my favorite right behind lagavulin 12  i have had the bowmore 12 15 and 18 and they are all good laphroaig or a lagavulin good no of course not but this is definitely an islay single malt you should have if you like peated whisky i actually like bowmore 12 quite a lot and for the price it is well worth it where i live laphroaig quarter cask is ten dollars more expensive and 6 out of 10 times i would go with laphroaig but that still means that 4 out of 10 times i would get bowmore  i hadn 39 t had this malt in my cupboard for a while so i thought it was time for a re acquaintance and i 39 m really glad i did i really enjoyed the more subtle fruit and smokiness than some other more heavily peated islay malts i 39 ve been drinking lately and there was a lovely floral note in the finish something like lavender or the old parma violets taste if that makes sense also at just under 163 30 for a 12y0 islay is this the best islay buy the only thing that would improve it is if it were a higher proof and non chillfiltered but then of course the cost would go up  i should acknowledge for those that may not know that bunnahabhain is the exception to the rule for the traditionally peated islay whiskies  smooth sweet and a touch of peat i enjoy 39 coastal 39 notes salt and cold smoke but the complex nose and the smooth palate weren 39 t enough to overcome the underlying base of a lingering antiseptic iodine taste and smell i enjoyed sampling this and will try the bowmore 15 next but for now if i want a 12 year islay its got to be bunnahabhain  love laphroaig ardbeg caol ila and lagavulin bowmore 12 no so much i couldn 39 t believe how quickly the taste fades from the tongue if you love a peaty islay skip bowmore and stick with the islay powerhouses  id agree with the commenter who talks about blind tasting i bought a bottle of bowmore mainly so i could complete my sampling of all islay distilleries it was bottom of the list and almost felt like i was buying it for the sake of it i was surprised from the first whiff of the nose im pretty sure if this were from one of the big name distilleries everyone would claim it was the finest scotch you could get wonderful well balanced consistent and with a really solid offering from nose right through to the excellent finish delicious indeed a must try in my book as other reviewers have said bowmore 12 year old offers one of the best values on the market gentle smoke and peat and a whiff of fresh sea air honey and vanilla flavours make for a very pleasant dram there is also a slight metallic taste that for me is oddly appealing it 39 s rather subtle i am from a coastal region of canada but have been living far far away from the ocean for several years now and this drink always brings me home  this is my go to dram having often been enticed by the charms of others i find myself frequently returning to that warm enbrace of a slightly hefty buxome well known friend enjoy  i love scotch and i have almost 20 bottles in my collection i especially enjoy the islay scotchs and so i thought i would buy a bottle of bowmore i was pleasantly surprised how smooth this smokey whiskey was the peat levels are around 25 ppm thus i could definitely taste the peat i invited some scotch friends over to take a blind taste test of some of my scotchs to see everyone 39 s favorite in the taste test was laphroig 10 highland park 12 talisker 10 ardbeg 10 ardmore macallan 12 johnny walker double black and oban everyone had bowmore in the top 3 of these powerhouse scotchs i then showed them that bowmore was one of the least expensive ones of the bunch it then started to taste better  my december 5 advent calendar dram what a great treat one of my all time favorites from the islands lovely smoke flavor  day 5 of the advent calendar and we get the first properly peaty single on the nose it 39 s strong peat and woodsmoke with an undercurrent of something almost antiseptic but some sweetness and fruit as well i 39 m not a fan of peat and this is about as much as i want in a whisky however although only the standard 40 it lacks smoothness and feels much stronger and very raw in the mouth the peat and smoke continue but struggle to get past the alcohol when it does die down the it blends into leather and there is an acrid tail reminiscent of tcp antiseptic again a splash of water helps calm the alcohol but leaves the same acrid tail peat lovers will probably like it a lot more than i do it hasn 39 t converted me i 39 m afraid  someone was asking about wether this is gluten free yes it is anything that is distilled such as whisky despite being made from grain destroys the protein that affects us so you are safe to drink and enjoy i just wish real ale was too  good value smokey but not excessively so a distinct metallic taste from the geology of the water source to the the distillery worth a try  tried this a few weeks ago quite smooth for a single malt peppery taste slightly citrusy get a sense of honey as well perfect for the winter sat round the fire with a cuban cigar i have never been a scotch whiskey drinker i do like a good tequila like don julio 1942 but all beer and wine for me i am really a huge wine fan but looking to try new things store was having a sale and i picked this bottle up very delicious just had it neat the nose was quite powerful at first but it was so smooth and tasty surprised how much the nose and the flavor are different to me this bottle may have just made me become a scotch drinker too  if you 39 re heavily into smokey whisky and i mean heavily this might be up your alley i found it quite overpowering but mellows slightly with a wee drop of water  i 39 m a highland park 12 lover and the store i visited out or town did not have the hp so i thought i would try this always wanted to try the bowmore 12 well it 39 s good but not great i enjoy it but don 39 t love it as one reviewer said if you 39 re looking for something to spend the evening with its uneventful still a good whisky for the money  very good but only second to lagavulin 16 years old for me smooth for a single malt  i was long put off by the relatively low score this whisky has here but since it was on sale for a very low campaign price in our local supermarket i just had to buy it and honestly i don t really understand the modest reviews this whisky is often getting sure i can think of a handful of islay whiskies that are better but all in all and especially for those loving a bit of peat in their whisky this is a very good dram the price performance is among the best and it is very very easily drinkable and you need those in your cabinet something that you would just like to enjoy and not think too much about so i wouldn t be surprised if i will always find a bottle of bowmore 12 in my store from now on maybe it has to do with the fact that this was my first islay in 10 months and i had forgotten the taste of peat but who cares really any whisky that makes you feel like coming home again deserves a clap  pretty damn good and it doesn t give you a headache or hangover providing you don t drink more than 700ml in a 12 hour period  its an alright dram nothing special but fair for the price i found the finish to be very drying besides that i agree with the mom chaps i didn t hate this just would go for something else in the future like a talisker maybe i just like them sweet and salty cm mmm it doesn t get much better than this  if you re new to islays this might be a good dram to try because it is simple and not strong on the mouthfeel that said if you are looking for a dram to spend some time with i find it pretty uneventful the nose is great savory peat and sweet fruits with spices and if you let it sit in its glass for ten minutes the flavors do come alive a bit more as the peat recedes but the flavors are still weakened by the processing making it a frustrating experience at 46 non chill filtered and reduced caramel it would be a fantastic dram  i do like the nose and finish but found on the palate it was too sweet for me i ve never been a sweet tooth so was a shock to my system tasted of burnt caramel to me  honestly i adore bowmore it does have a strong peat taste but this is blended with a really really nice honey and lemon taste it is so easy to drink and for me a wiff of an empty glass is almost as pleasant as the drink itself  i reviewed and reviewed then reviewed some more this had decent reviews and for the price i must say not bad you can definitly taste the quality and if there s a better islay scotch at a better price 39 99 then id like to know  this is just right for me the balance is right and it is very well made johnny norfolk never tasted anything so wonderful given to me as a gift and was the perfect antidote for my cold slept like a baby p s any other licquor gives me quot crazy legs quot and scotch is so pure it never happens  all whisky is gluten free during distillation the gluten are left behind while the alcohol and some vapours that give the whisky a nice flavour passes through so you don t have to worry if you are sensitive to gluten  light peat heavy smoke not subtle just yummy perfect when the wife or the law won t let you light up a good cigar thank you god for islay  this is one of my favorites definitely the best scotch at this price range and probably up to double the price very smooth and just the right and of smoke to sip on over a long period of time am trying to find another that i can add to my quot goto quot list but without luck so far treat yourself and try this gluten i am a coeliac and extremely sensitive to the tiniest gluten contamination whiskey and other spirits do not contain gluten as the gluten protein can not cross the distillation process however it is possible for cross contamination in the aging process through barrels etc which is a long story i love scotch and after many many different ones have only once or twice been contaminated and even then it could possibly have been something else i can tell you i drink this particular bowmore ever couple of weeks and have never been contaminated so i can vouch for it being safe  bowmore was the first islay malt i tried and i am still very fond of it the perfume aroma of the past has now gone and been replaced by toffee but the beautiful bowmore smoke remains not at all complex but a lovely dram just the same toffee and smoke great  as we speak i m sitting at a bar sipping a glass of bowmore it reminds me of burnt urine i love smokey flavor in my whisky but this is not good i well maybe il get laid tonight and if this flavor ever subsides i ll order a glass of something else bowmore has a unique style and if you like it you will like this personally it s not my favourite among the islay whiskys but that s not saying it s poor just that it s different to most other malts on the island  got my first bottle today and it s a nice sip i am used to laphroaig and ardbeg so this bowmore is a little too tame for me it lacks the taste explosion what you would expect from an islay whisky but once you ve adjusted your expectations it s a really enjoyable drink wonderful nose toffee fruity and very mild peat and smoke taste wise oak licorice peat sweet malt and some soft fruits but very too mild medium long finish with slightly bitter marmalade taste  i couldn t drink it just opened the bottle and after several tries neat added touch of water and finally poured it back in the bottle aberlour has spoiled me  take your favorite perfume and and spray it in your mouth then set a match on fire let it burn out then eat the burnt match then you have an equal taste this is just so good not the most well known and not as heavy taste and all the beter for it you will not find better at the price i strongly recomend it and hope it is to your taste johnny norfolk  smooth yet complex mild yet fiery lovely stuff  true its made from barley but my understanding is that the distillation process denudes the gluten protein which is not the case with fermentation to produce beer which does contain gluten so chaps i think you need to do more homework why not ask the distilleries to clarify this issue and have their whisky tested for gluten so it can be categorically stated that would be a great service to the gluten intolerant and also business wise  nose flowers perfume citrus seaweed misty smoketaste smoke perfume soapyfinsish smoke seasalt citrusoverall an ok whisky soapy at first but lessens when the taste mixes with the long finish so first sip not good 2nd and the rest ok i much prefer the 15yo darkest of bowmore i much prefer a glenfarclas hi there unfortunately as whisky is made with barley it cannot be classified as gluten free the chaps at master of malt hey is this gluten free whisky  my kitchen will always require a bowmore more 12  the single bottle of bowmore 12 i ve ever tried tasted rather like the distillery burned down and some charred casks were recovered from the wreckage heavy smoke but of unpleasant flavor as if wood smoke not peat smoke had been used but then single malts are often quite varied in their flavors the standard lagavulin purchased in canada and italy tasted like completely different whiskys one bourbon smoked fish and the other huge persistent phenolics so i d be willing to try bowmore again and see if the one was an anomaly or even undeveloped taste on my part at this cost what did you expect this is just a nice wee dram in fact it is one you will ask for again i m sure of that give it a go  its a good scotch good value and i ll re visit it in future no doubt but hard for me to get enthused now ive tasted ardbeg amp lagavulin im afraid as these two are what i want from islay whisky  quanto e esse whisky the lemon is what gives t his whiskey its finish for the price you cannot go wrong  i must say i get great pleasure sipping on this whiskey while looking at the sun set  very tasty islay whisky a wide palate and nice complexity it s a bit underrated a perfectly balanced dram  this is a reference in taste essence and overall character from my limited experience of tastings the best quality for price especially balanced taste and aftermath each glass offers novel developments in tastes  while there are some good qualities with the whisky it tastes as if it were aged in old wood as there is a lack of freshness also bringing it to a higher proof would help the flavors as this tastes over diluted this is a great introduction to the islay style the smoke is there but develops subtly and doesn t overpower the other flavours however the 12 year old enigma is even better look out for it in duty free shops  bowmore is the range that gives you the peat flavors without them overwhelming all others the 12 is a great daily dram but the older ones get progressively better with the peat evolving delightfully  excellent balance between dryness sweetness peat and smoke after a while the taste becomes very oily and dry like it it s perfect everyday islay dram ps caramel added but it does not matter for me  my regular sipping choice great value and great taste not too peaty not too smokey not too sweat with a good nose to it and with a great price can t go wrong here 
2082.0, the pinnacle of generic malt if you find gf12 bland and boring it 39 s your palate that has the issue not the whisky there 39 s plenty there for an experienced palate  boring limited average nondescript disappointing i agree that this glenfiddich has taken a decided turn for the worse very disappointing it seems to have been totally emasculated i hope glenmorangie and highland park don 39 t go the same way  now i really have my own hotel lobby inside my apartment with this glenfiddich 12 on the nose very light hints of flowers minerals orchard fruit even weaker hints of malt honey and orange peels a little bit spirity on the palate green grass sweet candies and malt minerals some memories of smoke too finish with sweet light hints of oak specially when i 39 m breathing in oily smooth mouth watering not dry and with medium length no bitterness this whisky isn 39 t meant to be a complex carousel of an islay dram so the credits shouldn 39 t be put in comparison with those whiskies that are in other categories this is the hotel lobby whisky for the broader range of consumers and i think that it 39 s a very good whisky for beginners good value for the money  very bad especially it lessens the whole field of single malts simply blown away by the likes of laphroaig and talisker for the same price even black label is far superior it is very harsh with a compacted palate associated with blended whiskys i have found superior blends in budget supermarkets for less than half the price  classically reliable i always return to glenfiddich 12 year old good value nice smooth malt but the 15 is just that bit better not that i 39 m complaining having consumed 8 bottles over two years  smooth drinkable one of the few whiskies i want more than 2 glasses of in an evening just good quality  fresh light floral and in my opinion a bit boring  a classic gentle speyside really easy to drink sweet flavours with a strong pear note that s there from start to finish ive bever been more disappointed really really boring glad it was 25 off but would never buy again  very good whiskey great value smooth and nice flavours  on the nose the smell is light and all i could smell was apple the taste is smooth and the finish is quite nice and full of malt i 39 ve always had the best of glenfiddich the aroma of pear that bursts at the beginning is always a distinctive taste it 39 s great fun when enjoying it with the addition of ice cubes or even neat one of the best single malts  this is an excellent standard single malt which fits to any moment smooth but has a character  been drinking this since i turned 18 love the fruity notes and warm body excellent to relax with by the fire  nose sweet woody lichen palate dense flavours that bring into robin hoods sherwood forest whilst in hiding there is an odd metallic note on the sides pleasant after the after is a subtle all but absent phrenolic heather classic  whats happened to this classic speyside i 39 m usually a jura origin or chivas regal man but someone recently gave me a bottle of glenfiddich 12 i remember it smooth and creamy with hints of honey and easy to drink what i 39 ve got is little nose a huge whack round the chops of alcohol with a burnt malt aftertaste this was my first single malt and i absolutely loved it very smooth and nice sweetness doesn 39 t have that burn that other whisky has i really enjoyed it  glenfiddich 12 introduced me to malt whisky long long ago i revisited and purchased the new bottling to see what 39 s changed not much still a good dram a little more apple than pear this time malty sweetness not too much a little more quot bite quot than i remember could be the glencairn glass not too complex but very consistent and a good reference quot standard malt quot with an easily recognisable character  agree with others that say it 39 s changed for the worse i used to drink this in the late 90s and again in early 2010s and it was always great since 2018 it is way inferior to other brands for the same price even the longer aged bottles i got a three pack up to 18 year all bad  i always think of glenfiddich 12 as the benchmark speyside to compare all others light floral and sweet and very smooth with definitely a lot less burn than the glenlivet 12 because it is so ubiquitous i think many whisky drinkers are just a bit snobbish about it however it is easy drinking and still a good and classic speyside single malt whisky recent reviews below seems to think it has changed but my recent purchase april 39 20 is as good as i remember  yes i have a bottle of glenfiddich 12 which my mum gave me just before she passed away on christmas eve 1998 i have that original bottle and i have a dram in her memory each year recently i bought a bottle of glenfiddich 12 and was surprised to find how much it has changed and not for the better  i first tried this around thirteen years ago it 39 s changed slightly and although i still buy it occasionaly i think it 39 s lost a bit of those pear apple notes and is slightly more bland than before  they ve definitely changed the taste bitter now with a taste of raisins that you get in cheaper whisky used to be one of my favourites not now  it was not the same as it was a year or two ago completely basic taste like they were trying to be a basic as possible without being innoffensive problem was that i got harsh grain alcohol notes in a few sips that made me wonder if it really was a 12 year old none of the fruity estery goodness i remembered good for alcohol effect but not to enjoy at least for the 2019 bottling hope it goes back to the old way  recently bought my first bottle in a long time the taste is harsh with burning and not smooth glad i didnt pay usual price excellent whiskeyno more options i remember it smooth with a hint of apple and sort of creamy finish my bottle is bought in january it 39 s taste is rough and burning it has a sharp finish too this is not the same dram it used to be  i member this smooth and rounded with hints of apple and soft of creamy taste now sort of burning taste and has some rough or hard edge not the same dram it used to be  mmmm  i think the recipe has changed drink it for years and bought a bottle just before christmas it s a paler colour and tastes different no comment superb i also purchased a new style bottle a couple of weeks before christmas noticed something off in the flavor immediately harsh finish seems like one other person here had same experience i let glenfiddich know but i have not heard back anyone else experience the same i am in nc  i duno i have never drunk it but i know that my dad loves it so i am buying him a bottle for christmas  is the new glenfiddich 12 year different or did i get a bad bottle i purchased one last week and it was just flat kind of a harsh finish and no hints of pear or fruit that is typical of this single malt just curious if others have experienced the same  for a common whisky you can pick up at any local shop this is great it has become my go to whisky over jamesons i know a bit of a clash and for 163 25 its a steal  nosing is fresh budding flowers slight vanilla and oaky woodenness honey on the very edge taste has that honey show up very short and sweet almost tastes sherry cask ends with a nice wooden bitterness would be a great quot go to quot cheap choice light floral dry and a touch of spice i like it better than glenlivet 12 only because it is a bit more complex overall not bad but spend the extra 5 to get craigellachie 13 same profile only fuller richer and a little more sweetness  brand is brand i absolutely love this stuff for 163 25 still think it 39 s nicer than the 18yr old glenfiddich and the 15  nose floral with touches of apple and cinnamon palate very smooth with a creamy malt aftertaste laced with sweet fruity flavor finish still smooth with more cream and oil notes coming through great for under 50 bucks but leaves one curious about the older offerings  i 39 m no expert but this is definitely my favourite scotch around the 163 30 price range  sweet fruity and a decent speyside not the best but not the worst cheap and easy to find for the occasional drinker or beginner a good starter scotch not a fan of the low abv chill filtration and added color i wouldn t buy again due to so many better scotches out there but i wouldn t turn down a dram if offered either  after being disappointed by numerous once classic whiskies which have been deliberately ruined by despicable ceos i took a chance on this it has a an oily backbone which is sadly lacking in many malts these days at 12 years old it cannot be expected to have the oomph of an 18 nor does it try to instead it is light floral lemony almost like a white port the finish is in the mouthfeel which is buttery and quite long very dry with a hint of saline for the price it 39 s very nice a great original which remains unscathed in these dark times  after reading many popular reviews of this single which was the first scotch whisky i ever put in my face i must say that this is a different animal it used to be raw spirit and inferior to many many good blends well it seems that someone at grants copped on and it now tastes like a respectable 12yo entry speyside pleasant sippablr straight or with a splash of water but it is still only decent nothing more at below twenty quid worth a punt but not a penny more enjoyable 12 year old malt good prices at the moment around 163 24 for a 70 cl bottle lots of whisky snobs will tell you it 39 s awful but that 39 s not so it 39 s a typical decent 12 year old speyside yes their are plenty superior malts to this but nevertheless it 39 s a pleasant inoffensive amp easy whisky to drink ignore the half a star reviews i think it is popular for people to bad mouth a classic to help them feel more discerning and special but this is a good whiskey it s light and refreshing palate cleansing i can taste malt cream pears and soft banana with a nice oaky finish it s not the most complex whisky but it is smooth and balanced and for the price is quite extraordinary  ambrosia relax enjoy and thank whoever you think is responsible for a small amount of you time at its best  great my son gave me a gift of quot dice rocks quot to put in the freezer i like neat have to say though the glenlivet faired better on the rocks quite simply it never fails it is smooth drinkable and enjoyable there are other whiskies that stand out more and do more for me but for general relaxed drinking the glenfiddich 12 year old is reliable and pleasant  nose apples sweet pear apricots green plums green berries citrus taste fresh fruits lemon dried apricots honey grapefruit slightly bitter on the finish not as sweet as expected finish refreshing palate cleansing fresh cucumber taste short to medium finish obviously it is not for people who are looking for great complexity smoke or peat but if you want fresh fruity light whisky this one is most definitely for you sometimes you just want something refreshing something lighter and this one fits that task quite well in a matter of fact it is so good at what it does i always keep a bottle at home  not a fan  terrible dissapointment feels unfinished rough amp young plenty of better alternatives in this price range  hi i 39 ve drank a glenfiddich for nearly 8 years when i first drank it i thought the nose was exquisite but as the years go by i find it to be a sticky sweet whiskey and moving on to other whiskey the nose is what i like but not the sweet taste as is too much this scouser s opinion but if it wasn 39 t for glenfiddich i would still be drinking blended whiskeys  generally this is where everyone starts or with glenlivet 12 mostly because of availability and price the 2 are very similar it 39 s drinkable and average every year it 39 ll taste a little different  nice light tasting scotch good for beginners as it s not an intimidating strong taste perfect for a starter glenfiddich 12 39 s aroma is simply amazing fruity floral hint of pear in order of prominence it really brings you to a sweet orchard the palate though good in its own right is quite disappointing compared to the aroma sweet spice vanilla and oak in order of occurrence it just doesn 39 t quite match the aroma the finish is even more bland there 39 s nothing to pick out and it goes away rather quickly pros great aroma very smooth floral and fruity perfect for beginners good value for money cons disappointing palate generic and doesn 39 t match aroma flat out boring finish verdict this is a good speyside in its own right there are a few better ones and a lot worse ones  i quite like the nose but it promises a lot that it just doesn 39 t deliver on the palate some people say light but i 39 m saying thin empty lacking flavour and body i find the finish slightly bitter and chemical i bought this to start of the evening before moving on to more interesting bottles and i guess it 39 ll do that job ok people say it 39 s a good introduction to malts but i think it would have put me off trying more try bunnahabhain 10 instead you can 39 t go wrong  i m giving this three stars because i honestly don t know how i like it i m a bourbon sipper and this is my first scotch i get a lot of apple as others have said but not much sweetness and i find the finish very dry and bitter i don t know if that s a scotch thing or if it s just this one but i don t love that part otherwise i think it s pretty enjoyable  very fruity apple pears bit of spice not too harsh perfect for a beginner in the single malt world i prefer glenfiddich 15 solera over this one but that 39 s my opinion when you don 39 t want to drink something too much complex heavy this is the perfect choice if you want something simple light  fresh fruit particularly apple pear and melon with hints of oak wood very balanced and approachable 5  i sipped the glenmorangie 10 year immediately after trying this and thought that was of much more depth and flavour i know which one i would choose out of the both  it s a classic and very enjoyable fresh fruity smooth don t add ice to it the flavor just vanishes best enjoyed neat even in a tumbler  i was given this 12 year resecial reserve bought thrifty fine years ago good bad indifferent or all tha same not much to complain about here its light and refreshing not too complex for a beginner i get a lot of apple  my first gf12 was about 6 years ago when i had a surprise bottle given to me for my birthday and i really enjoyed it its not a complex brew but its a really pleasant one i now get one each year which is great  i very much enjoy glenfiddich 12yo over everything else i 39 m not a 39 must have every night 39 drinker more like 4 5 times a week will i relax with a 39 two finger 39 glass during the evening with 2 3 of those nights i may do two glasses in the same evening but during the years of many brands of scotch glenfiddich has a flavor that makes me strictly a scotch drinker when i have other brands of scotch in our home they 39 re usually given to me as gifts i have yet to try the 15 or 18 yo glenfiddich offers but christmas is just around the corner  my first fiddich excellent taste not sharing this one  nice light smooth 12 year if i have to buy a 12 yr  absolutely flawless fruity and honey smooth with something like a champagne scent great for and introduction to whisky  very good good not too intimidating nose is light first floral then a bit citrus y some spice at the end perhaps it 39 s just my bottle bought in 2017 but all i got is spice the upside is that it just goes down no aftertaste no kick which is good for new drinkers i suppose i typically prefer smoke but this is okay if you want something lighter nothing amazing but i 39 ve definitely had worse i 39 m sure there 39 s a reason it 39 s one of the most popular in the world good for a starter if you 39 re new to the scotch game  when i drink glenfiddich i am reminded why it is the worlds best selling scotch malt it is far more that a begginners drink  remember my grandad drinking this as a kid my kids now buy it for me a nice malt not too expensive a pleasure to drink over a good book  it 39 s fine quite fruity and floral not that interesting though  am i the only one that gets heartburn from every sip  i 39 ve bought about twenty bottles of this in 2017 i think the quality has changed during this time it seems it has become too liquoricy and has lost some of its other subtle flavours lately small sips remind me of the famous grouse eeyuk i think i must have got a bad batch but i 39 m sure it tasted better in january late last year i think i 39 ll have to make certain by buying another bottle on friday  very fruity hints of pear floral and freshness i was not able to pick up the sweetness i am giving this a 2 stars because the alcoholic taste is very dominant  i 39 m no expert to me it 39 s sweet and creamy very easy to drink definite hints of vanilla also for me very light floral honey malty amp a little oily this whisky is very smooth amp extremely easy to drink you hardly notice you 39 ve swallowed it  very light floral malty amp a little oily this whisky is very smooth amp extremely easy to drink you hardly notice you 39 ve swallowed it  beautiful whisky it 39 s one of the most famous single malts world wide given to its strong vanilla and creamy nose crowd pleaser nice flowery and honey pallet with hint of spices and smooth regular single malt lovers won 39 t appreciate it much but i bet you can please crowd who are new to single malt world i have had better scotches this is more floral and honey than i expected but not overwhelming overall it is palatable i prefer more smoky scotches and i only bought this because the liqour store did not have my go to i give it 2 stars  after enjoying whiskies for some time now i should note that this is far from a favourite of mine however at a cheaper price of around 25 quid you really can 39 t go far wrong with this it 39 s a decent sip on any given weekday and i 39 m only rating higher as the low ratings are just a mile away  i love everything from nikka whiskey to moonshine but i don t know if i got a defective bottle but it literally taste like the first breath exhaled right after a strong verp throw up burp i will try another bottle for finalization but wasnt impressed on from go around  not far enough from mixtures of alcohol color and flavor like johnnie walker red label for example  i 39 ve tried a fair few malts but have only just tried this one i didn 39 t expect fireworks but what i got was a pleasant sipping whisky quite fruity and some nice vanilla oil flavour coming through a touch of honey and spices and i 39 m sure there 39 s a faint whiff of smoke in the background for the price and availability it 39 s fine stuff not too sure why this can get such a bad rep based on my experience agree with poster below very nice with cheese  its a simple drink with nice crispness and pleasant smell its not fashionable but ignore the snobs this is an inexpensive option and nice with some cheddar also unfashionable and pickles  smooth and silky texture and soothing taste very pleasant drink funny how the worlds most selling scotch dosent really taste like scotch should if this is u first experience with scotch know that it can only get better from this alot better find urself a cask strenght independent bottler thats where the good stuff is ofc if u prefer light almost tasteless spirit by all means go for glenfiddich 12 this is not the most exciting scotch you can get it is not peaty or maritime and it is arguably watered down however it is very nice to drink some fruity notes with a real honeyed malty taste similar to jura but better in my opinion opened a bottle last night a present from my wife to celebrate me passing my driving test and am looking forward to more drams in front of the fire  way too harsh  i am a huge peat fan normally i can 39 t go past a ledaig or lagavulin but to have something on hand for guests who don 39 t like peat or a break from the norm i always have a bottle of this on the shelf smooth sweet easy drink  for something you can usually find in most corner shops and supermarkets it 39 s my go to whiskey for when you need to sing and fall into a stupor dash of water if you 39 re a bit weak but it goes down a dream sometimes you don 39 t want to sniff and swill and dissect you just want to get drunk and this is 10 times better than any blended rubbish and pretty well priced  my first and still one of my favourite drams having built up a good collection of various scotch whiskies and trying many many others i can honestly say this has always remained one of my favourites it 39 s easy to drink yet complex enough to make you think you are drinking a whisky above its price bracket will always be welcome in my collection  i ve always loved scotch and as a youngster i drank this whenever i could afford it instead of cheaper blended but it s only when you get older and have a tad more experience and money that you realise that while its always been a consistent amp great scotch it doesn t hold many surprises anymore it 39 s like an old girlfriend who you still have fond memories of but dont love you move on  yes this is my starter drink when someone introduced whisky to me since then i barrel aged a litre for 2 weeks and it definitely mellowed out got darker in color and a definite burnt wood as you bring the glass to the nose i have another barrel aging hopefully i can wait longer than the two weeks to have this batch to mellow out let you know in another 3 weeks  great drop of classic speyside malt very clean balanced notes of oak and orchard fruit really enjoyed this one  good pears vanilla and apples in the nose more vanilla orchard fruits honey and heather in the palate medium finish all in all a perfect beginners scotch or an everyday scotch a word of warning once you 39 ve sampled this it will lead to the 15 18 19 21 year old expressions it only gets better from here lads  don 39 t disregard this wonderful scotch as a 39 beginners 39 single malt every time i revisit glenfiddich 12 it reminds me just what a fantastic whisky it truly is among other single malts in its range  drinking this feels like time with your best matesome things aren 39 t going to change thank god for that bonus points for the memories associated with this one  goes without saying that this malt is good whisky for 39 beginners 39 simple pleasing easy very enjoyable for people with more complex and experienced tastes once in a while nothing at all to write home about  great for the price something i like to sip on in nice weather not too strong or thick  good taste but i still like glenlivet 12 years this really is a poor whisky i first tried this 10 years ago and being my taste of whisky i remember it as quite tasty back then however having tried some of the finest single malts since such as lagavulin and laphroaig make revisiting this one a shock there is so little flavour and i completely agree with other comments about the thick oily taste and texture i even threw away the remainder of the dram at 25 pound it is 6 pound more expensive than a bushmills and nowhere near as good  good nice whiskey but twice had terrible experience with glenfiddich 12 yo take more than four to five units no hangovers but a terribly listless feeling and feel sick not good without water loosening it my colleague felt it too so it s not my metambolism why to spend money for expensive whiskys its the best for the price  excellent excellent excellent like others i didn 39 t bother with this for a while because you see it everywhere so i assumed it was rubbish it isn 39 t  i had this neat on a transcontinental flight quite refreshing to be honest light floral with a hint of pear it is quite easy to drink would prefer it neat i added a little bit of water towards the end and it weakened it a lot  go 39 s slightly cloudy though  i 39 m reliavely new to scotch amp frightened i might not like peaty islay versions so am easing myself in this is my 2nd i 39 ve tried after being a sipping rum drinker for over 10yrs after the mineral kick this has a nice creamy mouth feel amp butterscotch taste wen u add cold water go 39 s slightly though it 39 s less ripe peaches n 39 vanilla ice cream tasting than glenmorangie 10 it has more of a poached pair with butterscotch sauce taste amp oily mouth feel non cold chill filtered for the win i do prefer both whiskies i 39 ve tried so far with water to loosen them any1 points below who calls non islay whisky bland amp blended should read amp they 39 ll quickly find out that all single malts are blended even their precious peaty 1 39 s just that the casks all come from the same distillery a blended whiskey by defenition is also blended but from many whiskies from many distilleries  i avoided this dram for a long time because of it being so common i just assumed it would be bad much like budweiser being the best selling beer in the us and also being disgusting horse piss when i finally decided to grab a bottle i was pleasantly surprised very smooth very fruity and light and if you wait about 5 10 mins between sips your mouth fills with butterscotch or toffee don 39 t pay attention to the scotch snobs this is definitely a good drink i actually prefer this over highland park 12 or caol ila 12 and not because those are peated laphroaig is my favorite distiller  the worst worst whiskey i have drunk bought a bottle one i will never do it again this is the only whiskey of the 25 i have tried that i dislike the oily taste is awful for me it tastes more of rapeseed oil than whiskey to me  f 246 rv 229 nansv 228 rt d 229 lig whisky bland de v 228 rsta jag provat konstigt att den blivit s 229 hyllad eftersom ingen faktiskt gillar den  as a scotsman i can say i ve tasted better that being said it s reflected in the price pay more money and get a better whisky simple it is quite a nice flavour i like the after taste  just love the taste name label and color of bottle  step dad is a huge chivas regal fan and got me into scotch i still enjoy cr but have come to love glenfiddich is there better scotch yes is there better scotch for the price no  is good with 2 cubes of ice reasonable price  been drinking it for over 50 years best medicine i ever had i got a bottle of 12 year old single malt nice whiskey but i much prefer dalwhinnie much smoother  a definite starting point for scotch in general agree slightly with the bourbon comments but this is still a great pleasure to drink   good quot all around quot scotch especially for the price here in quebec many if not most single malts are priced in the stratosphere to decide if i prefer it to its arch rival glenlivet i 39 d have to have a side by side taste test a great project for a cold and snowy day lt g gt  this is the first single malt i 39 ve tried and its so much better than the bells i used to drink when i was younger so smooth but still feel that alcohol kick great to drink at home whilst watching the snow falling outside look forward to the next drink in my single malt adventure  good stuff this was the dram that got me hooked whisky it is the perfect whisky to enjoy everyday at a price you can not argue with  fantastic so i have been revisiting a lot of the classic speysides and found this to be quite enjoyable super smooth with a delightful green apple flavor finished by a clean oaky tang a little boozy on the finish though i think that glenlivet 12 is just a little better on the aftertaste but this was surprisingly pleasant look forward to trying more from glenfiddich the sugarbear not a bad whiskey but very uninspiring imho glenfiddich is wonderful but you need to treat it carefully add a dash of water to your dram and then leave it at least 15 mins if you don 39 t it has a harsh scent and though nice toffee taste again has that harshness that splash and wait is worth it then you have a true sweet and caramel experience  why would you buy this over an aged bourbon its sour flavourless and has the most revolting mouldy after taste stop buying scotch because its scotch soaring bourbon prices and demand are because its better and costs less the death knell for any industry is when someone makes something better for less  bought a bottle of this to try scotch my first time ever after buying this i was disappointed in spending 40 on some revolting scotch essentially tasted like some cheap ass bourbon jim bean was better then this sh t long story short you get what you pay for if your looking to get some good scotchbe prepared to spend 80 a bottle or maybe going to a few different bars and seeing what they got to see which brands you would be interested in but i stick with what i said tasted like some cheap bourbon had some jim bean and i drank that instead i drink anything and everything but this is scotch is terrible sweet lovely smooth malt it is my new favourite possibly the worst whisky i have tasted overly sweet on the nose and taste even with water added it gets no better this bottle will be in the cupboard for a very long time  i think of glenfiddich 12 year old as being very special and will advise my south african friends to try some sometimes  the whisky is amazing very smooth and fine the best part is u dont get hang over the day after taste best with chilled soda  it 39 s a great restaurant bar single malt scotch nothing i 39 d go out of my way to find but it 39 s available most places it 39 s a safe choice  me encanta este junto a strathisla son de mis whiskys preferidos son whiskys de 12 a 241 os que le otorgo 9 10 un escal 243 n abajo de la excelencia muy buen whisky  can 180 t get any worse it 180 s like buying an empty bottle there is nothing there  always loved this stuff and always will this is the malt that started my scotch whisky journey  anybody who gives it 1 star is a snotty upper crust wanker all of the glenfiddich scotchs are great for their respective price points goodish starter whisky that is easy to quot get quot when you 39 re just starting to try out single malts it is not something i 39 d buy on master of malt where i 39 d tend to go for something that is not so widely available if you live in the uk this is widely available at corner shops supermarkets etc very palatable with some honey fruit and flowers in my opinion it is worth forking out the extra for the 15 year old if you are a more experienced whisky drinker as i think it is better value for money but that depends on your budget i 39 m not going to pretend that i drink this outside of the setting of a bar restaurant with a poor range but when i do it seems alright to me not excellent but alright  i wasn 39 t a fan  this is a very light whisky i 39 d prefer coke  ett litet p 228 ron men inget mer finns ingen kropp utan kropp inget att bygga med tr 229 kig  on par with canadian fourty creek except that this is double price of the fourty creek i am just very disappointed at this but i am may be biased as i have been drinking only the higher end single malt but either way this was an unexpected journey with gelnfidich 12 years if you don 39 t know any better you might give a high rating for this but you will be disappointed if you had anything better  it 39 s a great whiskey i have ever had i have been drinking whiskey for the last 45 years gf is the only one i enjoy and price very reasonable  like many i started with this one since then i 39 ve had many still consider myself a student of malts not a master having said that it 39 s simple for me when in doubt get the green cardboard box you just can 39 t go wrong i live in a hot country and there are few pleasures of life that cannot be surpassed by a glass of fiddich with a cube of ice and a few drops of water after a hard day 39 s work screw the snobbery this one is a malt for every season and for all ages  an easy drinking malt with some subtle and interesting pear and spice flavours one can always easily recognise the 39 fiddich 12 excellent value from mom and better than most similar priced premium blended scotch just don 39 t add too much water or ice  i really like the mineral limestone ish flavors can anyone recommend another reasonably priced scotch with similar flavors  gf 12 was the first scotch i had ever tried i 39 ve drank dozens since and at a recent tasting we did a flight of gf 39 s and nearly everyone there was surprised at how good it was for the price 40 in america yes the 15 is better but this is a good gateway scotch  light smooth with subtle robustness and richness glenfiddich 12 was the first malt i ever tried back in the 1970s it was recommended to me after i said quot i don 39 t like scotch quot having tried only bad blends until then of course it did the trick and i became a confirmed whisky drinker after 25 years or so of rampant rambling through various malts blends and irish whiskies i was diagnosed with a medical condition that required a complete stoppage of imbibing poor me nevertheless i still need to have a malt around for friends and family and with the holiday season upon us i chose the gf12 for this year it will appeal to the widest range of malt drinkers and best of all it was on sale for only usd 35 i may just cheat a little and try a teaspoon perhaps one of these days i 39 ll be able to indulge again for real happy holidays to all  i came to scotland on vacation and had the time of my life after looking at many different whiskeys i decided on glenfiddich to take home as a keepsake for a very special occaison it made it all the way back in my suitcase i had a what i thought was a good friend stay with me for a few months to start a career in a new town so she could save up enough to move her and her husband here to savannah georgia to make a long story a little shorter i found one evening my special bottle of whiskey not only was open but was half gone i needless to say was furious and heartbroken so much so i told her to take the rest of it because all i would do is get madder every time i would have to look at it its a classic case of no good deed goes unpunished so my treasure from a magical vacation is gone and i dont have a clue what it tasted like  about a year ago i gave this an 39 8 39 based on memory i remembered it as having an interesting hint of pear and a definite taste of scotland since then i had occasion to taste and found it unpalatable mineral and metallic and with very little flavour beyond that the whisky must have stayed the same so i guess i changed sorry glenfiddich  good to taste i generally prefer richer and more complex whiskies but glenfiddich 12 is great for a lighter scotch for the price it is extremely difficult to knock  i literally have to spit this in the sink when a friend poured me a dram i drink scotch btw this is utter pish and not worthy of the name buy yourself a decent malt like pulteney or acuhentoshan  sorry for my english it 39 s not my first language i 39 ve been reading the posted comments and in my opinion anybody who compares this whisky to a cheap blend or say it 39 s not wort tasting doesn 39 t know anything about the subject at hand this is a perfect whiskey to get into the world of single malts not overpowering smooth fruity and delicious also one of my first single malts along with singleton this is not supposed to be a overly complex peaty rich whisky but a youngish fresh crisp malt that can be you everyday dram  great one to start will make you start enjoying scotch whiskey glenfiddich 12 year is consistent and good quality its my quot go to quot whiskey more and you the 18 year simply cannot be beat but its also a pretty penny buy a bottle of the 12 year you won 39 t be disappointed  great for newbies same as aberlour 15 and singleton gets better at 18 and 25 years  i like my whisky powerful and intense so this isn t for me it s very light smooth and bland  it was my first single malt and it raised the bar very high the glenfiddich whiskies are generally my type of malts as i don t really enjoy the strong peaty flavour they are just perfect starting with this one and the price is really affordable so every malt lover can have a great drink in his glass every day cheers  reading some of the comments looks like many try this as their first single malt guess when i randomly picked this out yesterday i did the right thing i just tried it and it was my first single malt too it tasted like just an above average good blend i m no expert but i didn t taste anything special i believe all you seasoned drinkers can either detect very very very subtle notes and can hang on to that or you just appreciate anything thats not complete rubbish at any rate this was disappointing but as i m no expert im rating it a 7 same as it is now so don t hate me  not a bad dram has a nice finish to it but can be a bitter start best served neat with some whisky stones obviously there are smoother whiskers out there but some of you folks need to get over yourselves  a fine 12 yr old whisky safe amp always consistent  a perfectly decent single malt enjoyable chilled over ice  this is on a par with the cheap blends boring nose almost flavourless very short finish induces a nasty headache and general feeling of malaise after only a dram do yourself a favour and get a talisker on offer for the same price  a classic reliable old friend which is always worth having around  glenfiddich 12 is not bad whisky but for only a little more glenfiddich 15 solera is so much nicer like many others i started my single malt journey with glenfiddich 12 but find these days i am more partial to the islay whisky s such as ardbeg lagavulin and laphroaig guess i m a peathead i also enjoy whiskey from the other distillery area s but never buy glenfiddich 12 any more i am not trying to slag this whisky and they do have some fine whiskies other than the 12 but my tastes have evolved away from the 12 year old expression a fine starting point to the world of single malts but you will soon crave something more if you start trying other varieties of whisky  honestly if you have an aversion to alcohol why would you muddle the overall rating with your judge mental biased views get over yourself and stay off the boards glenfiddich 12 year is a solid single malt scotch with all the characteristics thereof don t listen to the haters  someone bought me a bottle and to be honest i do not take drugs i mean drink social brain washing that one is any different from the other i digress to be frank not sure why people drink the stuff so if you took the alcohol out no one would drink it and say it tastes like crap prefer a cup of coffee so ultimately all it is is a flavour to allow you to ingest the alcohol for the kick it gives pear and toffee my a55 if i ate a pear like that i d puke i won t make a whiskey drinker still ill probably remember what i did yesterday a re visit nose is sweet caramel apple and young whisky and grain spirit quite harsh palate sweet and one dimensional flavours do not linger watery aftertaste no oil nothing very average considering it isn t that cheap   but i ll give it five stars anyway to offset some of the snobbish reviews here this is a perfectly fine 12 yr old whisky consistent and it tastes nice  cheap amp dale  if this product emerged from some garage distillery in a scottish backwater within the past few years and had a limited supply the snobbery would snap it up imagine the reviews quot lovely pear quince apple and toffee quot or quot a delightful mellow honeyed dram quot etc etc i think you get my point this is a very solid and interesting whiskey it has its own character it s own interesting flavor and a very good quality  good entry bottle most people start to drink with something god awful and then say they ll never drink whisky again this bottle assures that they don t say that  it s not the best of the cheaper or younger single malts but it is an excellent whisky we all have different tastes so of course there will be people that won t like it but anyone that says this is a poor whisky frankly does not know what they re talking about or is probably just getting too caught up in what whisky enthusiasts regard as fashionable rather than the appreciation of the spirit  i chose this as my first foray into the world of single malt scotch i have few options where i live but boy am i glad i went with this one my first dram has opened my eyes and has gotten me all hot and bothered to continue exploring the vast world of scotch whisky  must say i was expecting some snobbery but not to this extent this and glenmorangie 10 year old have started my love affair with malt whisky and while i develop my pallet i will not forget where i started from and nor will i stop recommending this fine drink  because people know i like single malt scotch and it is cheap i keep getting this as gifts even free i can t drink it neat like i do higher quality scotches i save this or company or for making godfather s  very nasty stuff and overated it made me make a face off a sip i never make a face this stuff is disgusting brothers stay away glenlivet12 tomatin 12 highland 12 old pultney 12 try something else lol oily jam rags cinnamon thieves a shoulder to cry on custard flancies sump fist of fury and domestic violence to name but a few of the tasting notes emotions evoked by this exceptional bellend of a whisky  i have been drinking whisky now for 20 or so years now amp trying over 20 diff single malts even though i find the glenfid 15 smoother amp more mellow i still come back to the 12 because of its more robust experience very nice whisky smooth and very fruity for me its good recommended  we are a big wholwsaker in holland and europe i am visiting scotland next week and looking for special deals overaged stock cheap prices big volume prices please and a tour at yr companygerald boomgaart jerry  it s a very nice and easy whisky to drink not challenging at all but really pleasant  light and fresh nose but compared to some other bottles in this price range somewhat uninspiring great everyday dram or first glass not complex at all and i guess that s what some people like  been using this to clean and alleviate the pains of a wisdom tooth works better than salt water and tastes better too but it s a single malt whisky  amazing scotch admittedly it took me a few days to start to appreciate it but when i did i d found a new love in my life i d go as far as to say this is my favourite whisky although i do plan on treating myself to another glenfiddich 15 at some point  not bad not good has so e complexity but not enough it s a wee bit harsh but compared to other singles at this price point it s not to bad at all the standard one to have in the cupboard for others but not one i would personally have unless my options were limited  personally i think it s fine although i am far from an expert though if you re into something different try it with fire roasted marshmallows around a fire pit leave an interesting finish something like caramel and coffee yum  light and floral not my type of single malt this is boxing above its class the glenfiddich 12 has more in common with j amp b rare blend and cutty sark blend the nose is just harsh and unappealing like someone squeezed a tiny bit of salted grapefruit into a dirty rusted can full of grain alcohol the taste is like i said above tastes like a low cost blend flat uninspiring and just plain bad and the finish is actually alright with little oak and a bit of citrus zest but that equates to someone giving you 5 dollars after punching your baby in the face i have no idea why people love this scotch so much  it s hip to bash glenfiddich but i enjoy a good dram of it starter malt maybe but 10x better than islay jura for roughly the same price oily on the palate but not overtly with sweet tones of flowers fruit and tobacco base moderate finish with a kick of damp oak leaves just enough fire in the belly what more do you want from a cheap single malt  this was the first single malt i ever had and i really liked it then i had other singles now i would never drink this again they re better at selling scotch than making them  drank it last week at a friend s place just to be polite never was a scotch drinker not much of a drinker at all as a matter of fact after 3 glasses my husband was wondering where his wife went lol i was flying and loving it bought a bottle the very next day and drinking a swig right now  i liken this to johnnie black the same in so much as they are perfect in their smoothness and so drinkable for their fineness and neutrality this is the best single malt for me i drink woods 100 for a strong hit  mmm i have always been a blended whiskey drinker for a first time a friend had me try this 12 yo and i truly think it was a delight that is all i drank the rest of the weekend it might be quot bottom of the barrel quot to some itch more developed tastes but to a newbie i thought it was great definitely will have it again and looking forward to trying others  it s not bad it s just not interesting if you re not a single malt drinker you can start here without fear but just know there is a big wide world of intense and complex tastes awaiting you this is pretty much scotch with training wheels  great start to the world of single malt scotch classic try it in preference to blended scotch av rampersad trinidad west indies  easy to understand sweet and mellow good to start with if you are new to whisky i would like to try the other expressions of glenfiddich to  my thoughts have already been summed up it s very pleasent but that s it sweet and simple no complexity and too alcoholic to drink quickly i would agree glenmorangie for this price  i m giving this a 10 to compensate for some of the ridiculous criticism on here actually it is an 8 but an 8 for less than 163 30 is remarkable very good whisky lovely hint of pear as one reviewer notes here and slightly mineral taste fantastic all rounder in most corner shops and high street wine stores this is head and shoulders the best product of any drinkable kind on the shelves  i know this glenfiddich 12 is often called the ideal starter single malt for beginners but i have to disagree to me the glenlivet 12 is better qualified for that and i am sure some others i ve not yet tasted would as well this glenfiddich is okay but has a cheap finish and lingering aftertaste that is something between cut grass and tabacco and not in the right fashion i suppose the price is what breeds the popularity but i d rather pony up for a bit better quality  yes this isn t the most complex of single malts but i actually think that adds something to it a simple fine taste that you can enjoy on any day at any time if you want to try something unusual then don t go for this but it is the world s best selling scotch for good reason  after last holiday in philippines i have brougth various whiskys brandy includes bushmills corvoisier jack daniels white mackey chivas but glenfiddich tasted the best my brother liked it  the green card tube is on every shelf that sells whisky its so common it must be rubbish its the xmas present for grandad etc this is a high quality 12 year old speyside malt whisky light delicate nose lovely fruity honey pallette a great bottle if you just want a bottle around and a must as part of any bigger assortment enjoy not very adventurous not much character but all this is overlooked for the smoothness much prefer glenlivet 12 yo same price but more of an experience  a great 12yr old single malt lovely taste one of the best  absolutely fabulous i drink at least a bottle a day and particularly love it poured over fried bananas what could be better for the real drinking man screw aroma peaty flavour and all that other bullshit this stuff will make your hair stand up and makes a perfectly good anti freeze for your car on cold canadian mornings and i have loved it goes down nice and smooth hits the spot after a long day at work or on a friday or saturday night relaxing really enjoyed worst single malt i ve tasted so far found it extremely conservative and devoid of any complexity exchanged it for the aberlour 10  well worth the price great for beginners like me nice everyday whiskey when your not looking for anything complex great to share so you can keep the good stuff very crisp and refreshing lacks the warming refined taste of the 15 and 18 but a great afternoon sipper it has such a fun palate and such a nice finish that i can t see why people hate it better then glenlivet 12 better then all the blended whiskeys i have tried except green label spend your money on it it s a treat i would go with highland park 12 though but you should try glenfiddich 12 to  incredibly well balanced light flavors but a full creamy body nothing at all wrong with this whisky floral with light sweetness but heavy and malty at the same time just lovely  people like to knock glenfiddich because it s the most popular malt in the world but it remains a safe pair of hands so to speak fresh fruity aromas dominate the nose and the palate doesn t disappoint a good introduction to the light speyside style  taste is a subjective matter this one is a safe play in the world of scottish single malts what they should do is cut the caramel colouring unchillfilter it and amp it up to at least 43 per cent alcohol would be a much improved and different whisky but money rules  of all the single malt s i have drunk to date this is without doubt the worst if this was all that a single malt had to offer i would drink something else how it ever won a gold medal is beyond me  a decent sipper i keep a bottle in the bathroom so i can have a dram whilst sitting in a nice hot bath bliss also good to have on hand as a general sipper to share with those that might like a whisky but aren t worth wasting the good stuff on keep a bottle handy i say this would be my pick for a general purpose whisky  i dont knowwhether to be flippant but rubbish equates to tripple redistilled cameldung ex gaddafi s back yard can ye no be a wee bit mair specific  i personally think glenfiddich is over rated but this is a fine whisky smooth and sweet can t beat the 18 year one though  this stuff bought at the heathrow airport gave me sense of being home even in germany ie frankfurt great stuff great quality great britishness thumbs up  a very basic scotch the finish is not what you would expect from the aroma or immediate touch to your tongue leaves much to be desired and reminds me of something one would make in their home who has not mastered the art price is not proportional to flavor or proportional to others in category many others in same price range that are far superior such as glenlivet unanimously it s better than a blend though i ll give it that but could use some evaluation from the maker perhaps some tweaking kind of like buying a car and getting the most basic model without power windows locks and some of the features commonly found in all cars now but again beats riding a bike  also enjoyed my visit around the distillery ar and my favourite is the 18 ye all love them all delicious well worth the money my favourite is the 12 year old enjoyed our visit round the distillery  much better than glenmorangie which is far too sweet for me i have tried most singles and unless i want to pay near twice the price i don t think it can be beaten no i don t much like peat i prefer whisky balvenie signature might just beat it though  overrated and simply man hanldles the palate for the price i d rather go with glemnorangie 10yo heck i d drink cutty sark before i drank this again   all of the above it has a lovely bitter taste up front that might put some off but then the taste develops it did not get to where it is in terms of popularity on the back of the 10 reviews here i d rather go by the mom notes if i were looking to buy  better than lambrini a good place to start learning whisky it s where i started because it doesn t have the sharper edges of the cheaper drams and it s not overly expensive this was a good benchmark of how far your palette has grown it was nice to begin with but now i can see that it is uncomplicated and a bit too flat for me nice nose but way to much caramel which spoils any other tastes that may but i don t think do exist underneath it s toffee sweetness in short poorly balanced and a bit uninspiring but a good beginners malt oh and the guy that said it s better than a blend doesn t quite get the point of whisky this is more artificial than any blend see above  the most adorable facet of this one is the nose some sweet and slightly bitter fresh green pear not too intense but very inviting on the palate this dram feels quite fresh a little bit juicy medium oily what it lacks is complexity and development the taste remains almost flat from the first sip throughout the finish being of short to medium lenght no peat or smoke whatsoever no burn efect also a good easydrinker and a quality malt for the price  this was the first scotch i ever drank as i tried more and more scotch whiskys and comparing it this inexpensive bottle i think it has as complicated tastes as more expensive brands i would definitely buy a bottle of it it s not peaty which i don t like so it s a great buy for the money you can t go wrong  its a very good single malt for this price id say one of the finest  it is mellow and oliy on the palate with a quite aromatic nose based on fruits and maltiness not a complex malt but much better than even good blends  it is mellow and oliy on the palate with a quite aromatic nose based on fruits and maltiness not a complex malt but much better than even good blends  flat and uninspiring money better spent on the 15 or better yet another single malt altogether  extra
2604.0, the 10 year is very distinctive doesn 39 t hide its rawness i can 39 t think of any other malt that achieves that salt and pepper taste the sweetness pears is there but at least in the 10 year it 39 s a backstage and there is no pretence that it is balancing the salty peppery phenols and to be frank the bite of the alcohol  good malt whisky i have tried nice smokey smells smokey nice amount of warmth could be longer and more complex but it is what i was expecting for the price it 39 s still ok but quality has gone down hill lost some of its sweetest as has gone a bit 9 volt battery flavour will enjoy my bottle but dont think i 39 ll get another i generally dislike peaty offerings laphroig jw green etc but i absolutely love this just the right amount of peatyness to make it different to my usual speyside preference when i want to change things up or a guest prefers a little peat  with the same money and compared to the ardbeg 10 this would be my choice at least there is a bit more going on to compliment the smokey punch is it brilliant no but it 39 s got a rightful place in any cabinet  tastes like drinking deli ham at least the alcohol content is high so if you drink it quickly the taste matters less and less wow kippers and popcorn on the nose spice and chilli sweetness delicious and intense this was one i was looking forward to trying for a long time whilst i wasn t disappointed i was a little underwhelmed by it it s harsher than expected and not as complex the smoke is noticeable but could do with being cranked up a notch in my opinion that said it s still a very good dram but perhaps not on the god like pedestal many put this on or maybe i just got a bad bottle would probably buy again on deal to test that theory out purchased for 163 30 so no major complaints  always in stock on my whisky shelf  talisker single malt scotch whiskey 10 year fresh on the nose smoke peaty apple on the nose oily thick seaside tobacco honey mineral musky meaty note on the nose peppery what can i say that hasn 39 t been said before this is quite possibly my favorite scotch its salty sweet amd smells almosy like grilled sweet corn its savory and just the right amount of spicy  17 talisker 10 the look 160 light amber and caramel like apple juice and seems to have an almost lightly unfiltered lookthe nose smokey light wood campfire but not earthy dark fruit cocoa powder and vanilla with a very slight smell of sea water the taste sweet smoky chocolate milk with a dash of vanilla syrup 160 the finish 160 stays for a while about 45 seconds 160 leaves a dry but not too chalky taste but the good news its delightful 160 much like drinking chocolate milk the bottle and box beautiful photography on the box the bottle has no frills and the text and font are straight forward 160 some nice cartography on the bottle and cursive text the verdict 94 ptsabsolutely glorious  sometimes enjoying a laphroaig 10 or ardmore 10 after a long day of work can be slightly arduous if you 39 re looking for peat but don 39 t want to be punched in the mouth by peat bomb like ardbeg or laphroaig then this is the best of best each sip will welcome you back like an old friend its the most well rounded peated scotch i 39 ve tried so far  the best  amazing never gets old so easy to drink go back bottle after bottle was a very welcome xmas gift  and the love never dies fantastic peated briny sweet whisky  after the sweetness of a malt such as glendronach and canadian irish offerings the first thing that struck me was the smokiness lapsang souchong is the closest description but that doesn 39 t have the following orchestration of sweet fruit notes and saltiness vale david john moore cornwell and thank you for guiding me to this one  smokey peat malty goodness salty i get hints of coconut and toasted marshmallows as well as orchard fruit beautiful  perfection loved every drop exactly what i like fantastic nose the nose is a poor guide as to what is soon coming palate toasted spice hints of orange mild underlying peat clean coal after temperature fixed peat with sherbeted spice  scotland in a bottle can t fault this malt when i first got into whiskey this is what i expected it to taste like unfortunately they all don t but i guess that s part of the adventure as princess kisses a few frogs to find her prince i have had to kiss a few glasses of the golden nectar to find my queen a great tasting dram  really a great bonfire peat with nice tones of salt and fruit lots of taste but well balanced  this is a great bottle for getting into peat smoke whisky on the rocks every night  so been into this single malt business for the last couple of years gathered quite a collection of single malts but keep coming back to talisker whisky is a very personal thing but i like the slightly peaty malts that taste of the sea and talisker always fits the bill to me the best whiskies are those that you can afford for your budget on a regular basis talisker skye has always been my go to just lovely and can be found at a decent price but always wanted to try the classic talisker 10 hubby bought me a bottle for wedding anniversary and just tried tonight and what a gorgeous drink the same mild peaty saltiness but a a richer sweetness too that it just perfect talisker 10 is worthy of the hype this will always be part of my collection now cant wait to visit talisker distillery next summer saving to just splurge in the shop because love the drams they produce  it is truly one of the greats unique in its balance of flavors as if it is the ultimate marriage between islay smoke and spyside sweetnes truly belongs in the hall of fame of whisky is there one  problably ralfy is right this wishky is younger than 10yo one dimensional and the nose doesnt traslate to the palate have bought a bottle in 2017 and didnt convinced me this year i gave it a second chance and nono sir it 39 s not nice i rather have a caol ila 12 or glenfiddich 12 instead of this one  beyond the horizon of oak comes a hint of apple peel sipped outside the talisker distillery with el boys sublime  the best full stop  very different yet enjoyable malt my go to malt is and always will be glenfiddich 15 for peaty notes and flavours my go to is jura superstition the best way to describe talisker is happy medium of the two where jura leaves a very peaty and smomey after taste this talisker leaves a slighly less harsh oceanic salt flavour behind its not neccesarily a malt i would drink in abundance but certainly will sample on occasion worth a go  this is the best single malt i 39 ve ever tried so far the smoke smell and taste is distinctive but not as dominant as laphroaig it is just as it should be the smell is also so fresh there is a huge salty peppery flavour beside a taste i can not describe clearly which i think is seaweed and it is absolutely delicious  first time i try any island brand and this was a bit disappointing whisky i 180 m not saying that it s bad not at all but as a great fan of laphroaig qc to me this is a very very watered down version of qc instead of oily it 180 s soapy and sugary instead of strong well balanced elements it 180 s weak it gives me the feeling that sweetness is there only to cover everything that it lacks possibly i will give talisker a second chance but definitely not with this  awful taste like something seriously rotten this must be the smoke i guess i can taste salt too possibly kippers but absolutely no fruity flavours what so ever i would give it zero stars if i could  one of the best if u like try a scapa brown guy below don t like go back to my gentleman jack as a review says it all  just cracked this one off fantastic the peatiness compliments and doesn t overpower the flavours of sweet and spicy oak plus the apple like fruitiness strong flavoured without being offensive this and glen moray 12 are my favourite 2 mid priced single malts i ve tried  i keep coming back to this one and sure it changes a bit over time but all whiskies do very distinct distillery signature that i happen to like a lot also very competetive price point i wish they would drop the caramel colour it would make it even more respectable all in all one of my go to single malts  the reviews below make me laugh for gods sake some even think it is an islay whisky anyway this island malt from skye is and always will be simply superb smoky peppery sweet full bodied an exemplary single malt  this is a very nice whisky it is not an islay like some reviewers say it is from the isle of skye and it is lovely  one of the isley 39 s best dram it 39 s now regular with me very rich fruity with a tinge of balanced peat smoke i am yet to taste a better scotch than talisker 10  give the billowing smoke in the nose some time and more zesty salty notes do come through the taste is explosive hard hitting peppercorn and chilli no alcohol burn though and then oaky fruity flavours ease their way forward beautiful peat smoke encases everything the finish is brown sugar caramel sweet with a soft smokey haze it 39 s a great islay malt  ocean of flavours in one beautiful dram this is a nice whisky but it 39 s not talisker corrupted for the damned american market where they have cake with their beef diageo you are going to hell  salt smoke herrings hard to beat  the best dram period not as peaty and smoky as the islays but mush more flavorful and complex than a speyside as some single malts change for the worst i can only say that the talisker 10 has gotten better in the 30 years that i 39 ve been drinking it  i am sorry but this whisky tastes horrible it tastes like some medicine with salty sea iodine water mixed together makes me wanna puke seriously i go back to my gentleman jack this is some over hyped glorified horrible tasting scotch horrid  heavy peat to the nose and somewhat complex definitely some brine and sweetness that i cannot make out as complex as it is to the nose i find it simple and straightforward to the palate the finish builds on the back of my throat a little wind and about to rain as i watch my garden grow perfect for the occasion and after a long day  very similar of skye and storm in gentle salty taste i quite like the aftertaste nice wee dram  smokey peaty yet a saltt sweet tinge  i tasted a glass of talisker 10 yo up at bc sun peaks a coupe of weeks agowhat a fantastic weekend it was amp i still remember my drink of tali 10 wow what an awesome whisky i will definitely be adding a tali 10 yo to my collection as soon as possible if only one then as a drinker  always one of my favourites a touch of smoke a puddingy chewy whisky very long finish a classic big dram  it 39 s definitely lost some of it 39 s edge over the last 10 years like laphroaig has the oloroso cask feel sweeter and the maritime brine seems more subdued still an ok dram but lagavulin and ardbeg has aged better  the smoke peat pepper it s all there eating dark chocolate really amplified the pepper at the back of my throat i love it just a fantastic dram  smokey peaty on the nose persistant peat and smoke on the palette which is most enjoyable  i must have had a bad batch because the bottle i have can 39 t be the award winning whisky people have been raving about i got it straight from diagio so i know it 39 s the genuine article but it just tastes like jack daniels at the end of the night harsh grain alcohol with a tiny hint of smoke i can 39 t believe the whisky is 10yrs old as i 39 ve had nas whiskies that tasted smoother and more interesting than this adding water brings out the sweetness from the american oak barrels but it 39 s still a middling whisky i 39 ll give it another go in the future because such a famous whisky must be better than this bottle  way too big bold spicy and smokey like sucking on wet bonfire embers dipped in fermented chilli sauce for a novice like me i 39 ll save this for friends with a more educated palate and keep on enjoying the more subtle fruity and mildly peppery flavours of cardhu gold reserve i tried perfect scotch for people who love smoky and dryness very posh i was bought this as a gift and honestly i was intrigued having not tried talisker 10yr before unfortunately the nose did not live up to the palate far too sweet in the mouth with a sour after taste relegated to the back of the cupboard along with the other sub par bottles to be used for other purposes in my opinion nffhc not fit for human consumption  this is not a beginner whisky but that said i will never understand how some ultra boring whiskies like balvenie 14 ancnoc 12 and so many others get such high praise or higher than this whisky well gentlemen and some ladies let me tell you this whisky unlike the ones above and most is a gem an absolute gem it is pure quality in a glass it 39 s an exciting and intoxicating whisky it 39 s like an exciting dystopia to the imagination but a blissful utopia to the palate the nose is very salty sweet spicy slightly smokey briny big and bold just wonderful it let 39 s you know quot i 39 m here and you 39 re in for a treat quot the palette is attacking but wonderfully so it is bold rich sweet spicy somewhat fruity the mid palette blossoms into malt chocolate and spice the aromatic long lasting finish resolves in smoke sweetness and the desire to repeat the process and have another sip if you 39 re enjoying a whisky like this that means you have graduated and are officially a connoisseur in your own right you can not go wrong with talisker 10 best scotch for the price and perhaps one of the best scotches on the market those at the talisker distillery really got it down to art what a treat  proof that a whiskey need not be aged forever to be great you want smoke check you want malty sweetness check you want salty check you want strength it is almost 46 abv this one offers so much flavor and at a fair price despite its power it is good neat or with a few drops of water  i buy one bottle of whiskey a month and building a little collection this one was the first one that did not last a month lovely taste  good entry level scotch don 39 t expect much and then you will be happy i find this a serviceable dram its not an ardbeg but then again that is at a much higher price point i get smoke and salt so i am not sure what others who don t taste that have been drinking i would buy it again and give it at least 3 5 or a bit shy if 4  it s ok has potential with some small changes but there are much better 10 year olds for around the same price ledaig 10 is miles ahead of this and with the same brine and smoky profile except they don t load it with artificial coloring and they put quality into making it i prefer ardbeg 10 to them both though  i bloody love it this is a whisky that satisfied all my fetishes my very first single malt whisky i initially wanted to buy an islay single malt but finally bought this gem from the isle of skye due to the unavailability of any islay scotch in the store on the nose after removing the cork and pouring in the glass i definitely got a non overwhelming smoke delightful medicinal peat live barley and chocolaty smell after a few moments the tobacco note was the best thing i experienced in a whisky maybe some seaweed later representing all the seaside characteristics after 24 hours one can discover that the sweetness profile of the whisky develops over time on the palate the chilli spiciness is just amazing definitely not a sharp whisky as it went down in a dead smooth way neat you can get the beautiful subtle barley taste initially some fruits chocolate exceptional tobacco notes some vanilla seaweed subtle brine just the right amount of peat etc the sweetness became more prominent after 24 hours the finish is exceptional as well you will get the meaty sulphury thing coupled with that tobacco that lingers for quite a time this part was heavenly and finally when you nose the glass after finishing that cigaretty tobacco smell lingers i was sold after that very part ps the most amazing part was when i went to sleep after finishing the whisky the meaty sulphury part was still lingering in my nose i could feel it it was there for quite a time and unaware i went to the dreamland quite a beautiful sleep to be honest this whisky can be best enjoyed at night time after finishing work and dinner as mentioned by jim murray  i really like how the brine and smoke compliment each other very well the slightly higher abv does help it s good for a ten year old but there is much better out there not much depth unfortunately this looks like it s got the typical diageo e150 overload which i can t stand but all in all it s ok but not good enough to buy again stop loading it with e150 and i d probably try it again  really a mediocre whisky for the money i 39 ve paid no complexity at all after 5 min that it takes to open up doesnt evolve nothing very weak character in the nose and in the palate dont buy it  excellent whisky very well balanced just enough smoke amp peat lovely maritimes amp sea tastes and pepper can find some sweetness notes as well fruits and sweet only whiskies just boring for me my first talisker will definitely try some more from them  honestly if this wasn t a typical diageo product loaded with artificial coloring to the point it doesn t even look anything close to real i would say it s a fine scotch however that just isn t the case here a touch of e150 not ideal but ok this thing is loaded with it to the point it looks like it s spend 18 years in a first fill sherry cask but an honest scotch at a decent price is not what diageo is about so as far as the scotch goes very salty some spice to it lacks complexity a little smoke decent but not great and far better options from much better companies out there for the price  haven t had a talisker in eons so decided to pick one up as a daily dram lovely whisky on the nose peach pit cresols and cereal the palate had warm smoke cocoa and almond paste medium calm finish with sweet almond and smoke that creeps up after a while after a few drops of water fruit and more sweetness and no you cannot compare this 45 8 abv to the likes of a cask strength corryvreckan but at half the price it is a well balanced and delectable daily dram in my opinion  decent but overall i find it falls short of expectations based on positive review and tasting notes i had it having recently had ardbeg corryvreckan and lagavulin 16 maybe an unfair comparison as a 10yr but much prefer the ardbeg and lagavulin in the peaty smoky category  unique whisky at a reasonable price definitely worth trying strongly recommended  i love this whisky but i do not get the smoke that so many describe instead i get beautiful minerals brine some cracked peppercorn and a nice pear and caramel finish it is a nice and long finish that makes for a nice long sipping session if there is any place i do get smoke on the palate it is the finish but it s not nearly as pronounced as many of the islay juices highly recommend cheers  affordably nice whisky my favourite at the minute tastes like the sea great value briny full flavour so tasty first tasted it in a small pub in a quiet welsh villiage while on holiday and i made its acquaintance every evening with a chapter of a book for the whole of that week now whenever i taste it it takes me right back there just perfect  if this is a genuine talisker 10 year old it leaves me cold it 39 s more like a bad copy that you would buy in tenerife and have the miss fortune of giving to a very good friend and wondering why they don 39 t talk to you anymore having visited the talisker distellery on the isle of skye i must say that this is a very good quality single malt of course there are other single malts made by talisker that are better however at a higher price but for an all round single malt at a reasonable price it is a quality whisky i m in agreement with the last review that this whisky is better than that of the normal talisker and talisker storm my preferred is the talisker double matured in amoroso cask wood  very good whisky  talisker 10 year old just never fails always enjoyable and heart warming and much to be preferred to talisker storm or talisker skye  not what it used to be this was a lovely scotch in 2005 but nowdays it lands closer to islays in the 35 40 range really nice 10 year old whisky best on the market amazing flavours of peat chilli pepper sweetness really gorgeous stuff though the talisker 18 is sublime  it s ok the peat is there and the salty taste is there some sweetness at the beginning and too peppery afterwards the taste is a bit complex  a hint of smoke but on the whole a very uninteresting taste sorry over priced for me  just rated powers johns lane few min ago 1 5 stars from middleton pernod ricard can 39 t go any higher with this one unfortunately 10 years old right probably in 4th or 5th filled casks it tastes young immature poor some sweetness vanilla wood no improvement with time in the glass and water peat is dominant but not pleasant avoid if you can  there are currently two single malt scotch whiskies that i would not order in a bar this is one it 39 s too much for my weak palate to contemplate it 39 s as if someone has decided that tcp flavoured whisky isn 39 t enough that they 39 ve added a pound of mud to each bottle to give it some body ok that 39 s a total exaggeration but it is far too overpowering for me it 39 s probably an acquired taste but i 39 m struggling to get passed the initial hit  disappointing rough and poor whisky smoothness and sophistication seem missing and there is little nose the lack of any mellowness and pungent phenol flavour are unattractive finish is short and adds to the bad impression there are several smoky and good drinking malts and this is not one of them no we didn 180 t change simply because once you fell in love with this dram there was hardly any quot better stuff quot having similar taste profile in the days of quot great talisker quot i drank quite a few older stronger and more expensive whiskies but still this one was my love for a lifetime one i kept going back to without a hint of disappointment sadly for a crazy someone it wasn 180 t enough to launch the bland nas expressions on top of that they destroyed the 10yo talikser as we knew and loved it what happened is that profit and simplification became more important than quality or customer satisfaction these days there are not many whiskies as good as they were in 1990 180 s or early 2000 180 s i suggest trying ardmore triple cask or ledaig 10yo instead both are miles away pure art of whisky making i think i 180 m done with talisker my heart is now sold exclusively to ardbeg  i m not going to say i don t enjoy this and i m not going to rate instead i m going to ask a question has this whisky changed or have we so much of what i drink no is unchilfiltered and uncolored hell even macallan doesn t use coloring can it be that we ve just all gotten used to better stuff  talisker was my first love my introduction to single malts for years i swore by i took a break from it for a few years wow heart broken what has changed me or it it didn 39 t display any characteristics of a quality single malt had i received it at a blind tasting i 39 d have guessed 39 islay mist 39 i miss my old friend talisker if you 39 ve made changes plz change back way 2 much e150 i feel i must agree with the review below talisker is for me and will most likely continue to be my dram of choice for big meaty meals especially game but i do not drink this on its own any more it 39 s just been too softened up and has been diminished too much for that i will also say that i personally am beginning to find it very hard to take these over produced artificially filtered coloured mega corpo malts seriously any more would love to know how the production of this has changed throughout the last ten fifteen years not for connoisseurs excellent dare i say cooking whisky  not too bad whisky unless you were lucky to know the older style bottling it used to be my no 1 dram complex and a smoky punch in the teeth but in current product i would not even recognize it is a talisker very sweet and tamed on palate with somehow artificial aftertaste i am so sad to say goodbye to this distillery after so long term relationship not to forget i started chasing the 2000 2010 bottles in auctions which is the only way to taste the real talisker as i know and love it  back on 17th march i tried talisker 10 for the first time and accused it of not offering even a hint of smoke peat or brine well i was wrong as a fan and regular drinker of lagavulin 16 machir bay uigeadail and tastival i m afraid the softer milder notes of talisker 10 just plain failed to register on my palate now with the arrival of spring and early summer my beloved winter heavyweights have been moved to the back of the fridge and their places taken by lighter malts including talisker 10 and what a lovely dram it has proven to be smoke and peat are there with maybe a late hint of wood ash but their presence is a quiet and gentle one and free from the medicinal notes of islay the soft smoke flavours are nicely balanced by sweet fruits principally pear with a hint of barley and a dusting of pepper for anyone who has yet to try peated malts this seems to me a cracking way to dip a toe in the vat and at the price being offered by mom this talisker 10 is an absolute steal  either i got a duff bottle or someone somewhere within diageo has decided to alter the taste profile without telling anyone not a hint of smoke peat or brine just oloroso sherry smooth almost sickly sweet with flavours of raisins toasted brown sugar and white pepper if you like bland uncomplicated sweet sherry whisky this might suit you but it s not what i was expecting and it s not why i bought the stuff if you re looking for a smoky peaty malt then delete talisker 10 from your shopping list  i say is that resin and are those pine needles yes  leading whisky in its price range a classic  complex er than lagavulin richer than caol ila fiesty where ardbeg keeps it mellow not as outrageous as a laphroaig the perfect amount of peppery sour and sweet moreishness itself this is what you serve with a steak the ultimate smokey whiskey 4 5 out of 5  absolutely amazing whisky works great as an all arounder for someone who loves whisky in general and is also a very good option to offer for guests as it has character but isn 39 t overwhelming for someone who 39 s not that much into whisky peaty fruity sweet with notes of honey or dare i say even a bit of a vanilla fudge at the side just perfect when you don 39 t want a peatmonster like laphroaig but also not too smooth  a delicious taste with much fruit flavor i would rate it 7 on my 0 to 10 scale it s a hamburger you 39 ve got your beef you 39 ve got your pickles you 39 ve got your mustard greens pepper fancy sauce burgers very savory medium rare  amazing my favorite whisky smoky peppery citruces awesome i get the distinct impression that this latest batch has been nudged in the direction of the peat monsters like ardbeg or laphroaig this has always been a smokey malt with notes of cured pork and a hint of campfire but it has stayed away from the medicinal oceany tastes that taste like a tarred railway tie set ablaze until now i get that the islay flavor profile has been growing in popularity i 39 m a fan myself but i hate to see skye follow suit for what i fear to be marketing purposes  a flavour profile different from anything else i 39 ve tasted it 39 s in the peatier spectrum but not too deep like laphroiag smoother than oban etc and slightly sea salty keeps me coming back   further notes 120369 120358 120369 120369 120358 120371 120378 immediately fresh and peaty aftertaste fades to faintly aromatic tobacco leaves finishing up as nectarous eucalyptus lozenges sacchariferous throughout  vegetal yellow fruits pomegranate honey melon cloudberries pineapple peels medium peat smoke light on the oak quite sweet slightly drying very similar to the caol ila but lacking the tariness of its islay cousin the peat is also more upfront in this one due to the slightly higher abv 45 8 good on them only complaint i have here is the chill filtering and the use of artificial coloring grrr how unnecessary  not what it used to be back on 2000 2010 now talisker 10 is just too sweet and glowing the complexity is almost gone so sad this whisky boom is disasterous to so many distilleries growing volumes lower quality there 39 s no way getting around that  more gentle than laphroaig but with a fine peaty intro oaky and apple taste lovely  ive had the talisker 10 many times but i cant get past the fact that its just a little lacklustre its not as punchy as an islay or even an island malt like ledaig and its also not as complex and fruity as something like arran macallan or some balvenies it doesn 39 t really combine the best of both but achieves it to a certain extent its just ok not bad but really not really great either  my entry into the world of whisky tries it eventually on my 3rd visit to the beautiful isle absolutely fell in love with it and talisker bay beach  i hesitated to purchase based on many reviews some simply categorizing it as complicated some seem to fear talisker i am pleased i made the purchase definitely a full flavored dram the smoke and underlying sweetness are there as is the pepper at the end that rushes through then fades  its a special drink i remeber my times on the isle of sky as a youngster when climbing soft with a quot bite of its own defines itself beyond others but clear apperance taste of smokey peat flavour strong and powerful heart warming and a real feel of the of the scotish iles this a drink to savoir and lingers on a man size drink but sexy for the lady in your life  i really liked the way the smokiness lingers as the dram hits bottom nice bloom fills your chest gently not overwhelming first sips makes the second one a given  this is a lesson to all distilleries on what 10 year whiskey is capable of i 39 d put this up with springbank 10 as one of the best values and smoothest drams for the young malt that it is i can 39 t help but laugh at the negative reviews especially ones that say they have ties to skye but are only trying talisker for the first time in mid 2017 ridiculous this is a standard against which other whiskies are judged and a key component to many famous blends  sorry but i could not get the hang of this whisky flavour was far too strong and reminded me of creosote i 39 ll stick to my tobermory in future  balance is what makes talisker 10 so good it 39 s smoky but not like an ashtray it 39 s sweet but not too sweet it 39 s peaty but you can still taste the underlying honey and malt and the finish long amp peppery fading into clean pure maltiness is unique and satisfying it 39 s both heavy and light at the same time i love it i like many whiskies but i always keep a bottle of talisker 10 on hand  the perfect breakfast scotch  very good strong but f 233 ria like smooth good smoky like it so much  absolutely awful i only drink neat scotch but i 39 m going to have to water the hell out of this or drink it with lots of dry like it 1st glass oh no then in the morning again and oh dear it 39 s a nice one not so strong smokey as laphroaig px cask 48 and stronger than glenfiddich cask collection 40 a very nice superb whiskey 45 8 just perfect  a very good single malt with a fantastic balance thick and well rounded like having a sea breeze in a rainy day smokey but not like laphroaig add few drops of water and let it be few minutes then start to drink you won 39 t be disappointed  it 39 s a good scotch very good but to say it 39 s like no other tells me you haven 39 t had much scotch every palate is different but you have a lighter scotch with tastes of barley malt peaty and smokey it might be the most common description used for the a scotch try some scotches with sherry or port and then say it 39 s like no other so much flavor as apposed to your typical coastal scotch  good and doesn 39 t taste like any other give your self some time to adjust  my brother gifted it after 3 pegs it looks pretty great loved it bought a bottle early on my malt journey about a year ago it was ok i revisited talisker 10 recently and quot wow has my palate evolved i absolutely love it quot  i just bought it first glass i 39 m having really not good  great whisky in the beginning it 39 s smoky then it becomes like cold damp rocky beach smell very thick oily after taste it returns very sweet and cold aroma reminds me cold black tea with a lot of sugar very long and sweet finish fantastic whisky  best drink for me balanced smoky smooth my go to scotch which is getting harder to do now that the price is 75 in the us the best balance between peat and malt you will find what 39 s not to like i visited the distillery many years ago before i was a whisky drinker oh how i wish i had been a whisky drinker peaty and full of character lovely stuff from one of my favourite places in the world skye  my new favorite doesn 39 t seem very smoky to me nothing like laphroaig or lagavulin anyway reminds me of a cross between highland park and aberfeldy two of my favorites  i 39 m sorry lads but this scotch is odd just purchased the bottle a few hours ago i have been sampling different regions recently and heard good things about this talisker 10 from skye i 39 m tasting a full bodied peaty slightly salty scotch followed by trash fire and iodine soaked bandaids the bandaid flavor sticks in my mouth for a long finish all but ruining my seaside retreat in my head someone mentioned this iodine note in a previous review but favored it i do not as a highly favorable biased reviewer with ties to skye i don 39 t favor this whisky at all  i have been enjoying whisky a long time and this stuff is without a doubt the worse whisky i have ever tasted it smells and tastes like dettol and after the first taste i poured the remainder of the contents of my glass and the rest of the bottle down the sink this whisky probably explains why there is only one distillery on the isle of skye  excelente malta ese humo volc 225 nico que desprende de sus notas pero a la vez muy fragante y medicinal recomendablemente bueno  very disappointed i used to be a huge takisker fan but after a decade or so away i came back to a rather thin and harsh welcome  wouldn 39 t buy again strong chemical taste to it like dettol disinfectent  i got married in 1991 and we honeymooned on skye my dad being an aficionado of good scotch you 39 d think i would know my stuff but no i drank teachers the cottage we 39 d rented included a distillery tour i proceeded to drink every dram as offered and finish off the daintily sipped drams of the americans too it 39 s 25 years on and i now know my whisky talisker stands up amongst them great great whisky  fruity combined with nori seaweed and betadine flavor just plain awesome nuff said  talisker 10 is the whisky that got me into whisky my first taste was quot this is it mind blown quot to this day it 39 s still one of my top favorites it 39 s one of the best balanced from a sweet smoke peat and phenolic standpoint malt sweet delightful smoke and peat brine sea water pineapple slightly bitter orange old wood saw dust with that peppery finish i love it  this is a re review of this lovely 10 year since when i first tried it a few years ago and reviewed it i forgot to add my signature now this is not the first peaty whisky i tried but it is the first i bought and learned to love this is sort of where my love affair with peaty whiskys started i love the simplicity of this just tastes like the deep cold seas around the isle of skye with some pepper and a perfect balance of peat smoke and rich oak really one of the best 10 years around it 39 s a real shame that it is becoming so scarce and expensive here in the states otherwise i would drink this everyday guess i 39 ll have to pace myself with this one cheers the sugarbear the tasting note by the chaps at master of malt is spot in but i also find oranges and earthiness a very good whisky for it 39 s age 91 out of 100  presentation classic scotch whisky bottle shape with a traditional style label in attractive navy blue and gold on off white the label contrasts well against the colour of the whisky inside the uncoloured glass bottle bottled at 45 8 abv appearance bright orange gold colour with consistency maintained through the addition of e150 caramel colouring and chill filtration a common practice with larger distillery s flagship expressions such as this aroma far off beach bonfire brine addition of water brings out a scent of sweet vanilla flavour spicy pleasant smoke finish long lingering smoke building to peppery punch would i buy it again yes i would buy this again but not for a while i would love to sample a cask strength version the talisker 10 year old is a great whisky to introduce to someone who only drinks islay malts it has a pleasant smokiness and a very obvious peppery finish which is a good indicator for anyone trying to learn how to identify whisky flavours for critical tastings whiskydad the nose transports you to the rugged coast of scotland but the first taste comes on abit strong on the smoke and peat but becomes more enjoyable as the dram goes down the finish however gets progressively softer an pleasently lingers on the tongue  very smooth an acceptable whisky not a wow  altijd al een van favorieten geweest sedert 1968 en ik ben heden 66 jaar super   maltmondaysthe nose fresh thick spice it s very pungent intense peat and old cellar smoke this is a real sinus opener every little nuance implies the sea oysters seaweed and crab all the good stuff the taste the intense pepper returns and lingers this whisky has a heavy body it would be a 15 aussie shiraz in the wine world dried figs oranges and grannie smith apples appear as the aftertaste talisker 10 is a beautiful eruption in your mouth the finish you ll have the taste of this dram on your tongue an hour after you ve walked away spice and pepper remain dominant the malty ness lingers and caresses your mouth with comfort and nostalgia for the maritime era a real delight  i 39 m an islay devotee so never thought to bother with talisker 10 but i was very pleasantly surprised nose thick spice peat intense white pepper sea airtaste intense pepper again sea salt dried figs orangefinish long and spicyfor the price point this is one of the best peated whiskies around  enjoyed many single malts but talisker always stands out in my memory i love the salty undertones and fresh taste maybe it was because it was just a 3cl sample but the advertised and eagerly anticipated thick pungent smoke was noticeable only by its absence especially when compared with talisker storm that 39 s not to say that i didn 39 t enjoy my first taste of the 10yo but i was left slightly confused as i brought the glass to my nose my senses were dominated by seaside aromas sea salt seaweed salted kippers wet hemp rope with hints of apple and finely ground charred oak swirling around the moment it touched my palate i could feel pink amp black peppers dancing with salted caramel and the charred oak all vying for my attention the pepper and char won out staying the caramel and giving a long warm tingling finish i added a drop of water which brought a sweeter edge to the aroma popcorn and brown sugar becoming equal partners with the previously dominating saltiness the palate was smoother with the pepper gang giving some ground to toffee caramel notes with the charred oak lingering in the background sensory journey tying up the lobster boat and unloading the creels stretching the arms out wide and taking in the sights and sounds of the gulls calling and the tide lapping against the pier nose 3 out of 5 mouth 3 5 out of 5will revisit and try a 70cl version at some point  bought a small 20cl bottle of this to try for to wet the baby 39 s head just had a baby boy and i 39 ve nearly emptied it already beautiful stuff only really tried glenfiddich before 12 15 and 18 year old so i 39 m new to whisky but this is very enjoyable can 39 t think of a better way to celebrate the birth of my little boy  one of favorites so far you heard the man this is a volcano ash explosion yet lacking the medicinal very peaty taste that accompanies islay whiskies like laphroaig i 39 ve had bottles that were better and some were worse but they all carry that distinctive smokey and peppery taste with some sweeter caramel and malt elements the 10 year old is my favorite talisker compared with some of the nas ones this one is just better rounded and has more depth to it than just the smoke pepper talisker flavor they try to deliver more of in the nas ones  its like i drink sand from a volcano i would never buy it again  the second scotch whisky i 39 ve tried and surprisingly i have made it this far without it  my first foray into single malts turned out to be my benchmark  fairly new to scotch drinking but i know one thing talisker 10yo is my favourite so far and i haven 39 t tried a whisky i didn 39 t like  first thing that hit me is the smokiness followed by peat for me not a hugely knowledgeable whisky drinker i can tell it has some complex flavours but i couldn 39 t tell you what they all are it 39 s a whisky that makes me want to learn more about scotch and the subtle differences between distilleries i prefer something smoother like glenlivet but it is still very moor ish and a single ice cube in a large glass softens the rough edges nicely without diluting the taste  this will be some peoples perfect whisky but for me there is a bit too much of a salty aftertaste still a nice sup for the price  call me biased but there is always a ready bottle in stock in my kitchen cupboard  my favorite peated whiskey i don 39 t believe that you need to spend more money for a lagavulin for example love it to  a distinctive singular malt as others state with an elemental earth and flint character moderated by heather and leather black tea and coastal notes just delicious as good as a 10 year gets and challenges malts half again it 39 s age it 39 s what highland park 12 should be mopping the floor with that dram and as sippable though different than the benromach 10 another must try current batches are good indeed share with discriminating friends confident of the comraderie it 39 ll infuse your gathering with see 2014 review at whiskyfun com serge nails it a quot wildness quot but a focused quintessential spirit lovely  i 39 m surprised how come there 39 s no marketing in south africa i have seen or had about fortunately a friend introduced me december 2015 holidays i have embarked on this fresh experience taste non stop ratings 5 stars a dash or two of isle of skype talisker single malt whiskey an ice cube or two plus a dash of still water observe your renowned mixture mingling amp forming solid legs after a nice swirl take a sip and feel a tantalising palate dissecting a variety of flavors bursting in the mouth then down your dash amp explosive taste giving you a wide smile accompanied by tears of full enjoyment woooh what a experience  this is one of the best daily drams forget about all the nas versions that 39 s just marketing  talisker 10 is my favourite malt of all time i love that it 39 s a little rough around the edges for me it 39 s the best of both worlds almost like an island brute had a baby with a highland lady and produced the perfect combo  awesome this is a very distinct malt and not really like anything else i have tried yet very smoky and an almost antiseptic flavour maybe as my palate for whisky develops i 39 ll appreciate it more as it seems to be an acquired taste  delicious very classy gentleman indeed i like it tried lagavulin first and it wasn 39 t my thing too smokey talisker on the other hand is just right i wish it was tiny bit smoother but still it 39 s a great drum  superb very smooth and a light smokey peaty taste well balanced peat smoke barley malt a fresh and intense one with a long and smooth finish maybe too strong i think 45 8 alcohol isn 39 t necessary to achieve the full potential of talisker 10 year old water should be used to open up for subtile aromas not to decrease the alcohol percentage  i 39 m just enjoying an early xmas slurp of this wonderful western isles malt just freshened with a drop of spring water i love the smokey peaty tang which is not as intense as islay but has a charm of its own by no means have i tasted all of the different whiskey but i 39 ve had quite a few i am yet to find a more balanced whiskey between smokey and peaty until i do talisker remains my all time favorite  its one of the best malts i like worth it  outstanding it brings you to the island and drops you on the shore a grand single malt capturing the wild nature of skye one of my top 5 whiskeys a great everyday dram  talisker is well nice a big glass with lots of ice and topped up with coke my favourite  i have only been tasting whiskey for a short time now 18 months and this 10 year by talisker is by far my least favorite on the nose there is a small bit of smoke but not much to entice the senses at the first layer of the palate comes a bit more smoke and spice but quot intense quot is not the best characterization this makes the whiskey decent to enjoy but where it loses me is in the finish i would agree that the finish is long and quot somewhat quot malty but not intriguing it leaves a long alchohol finish with little complexity or enjoyable notes this is not a bottle that i will finish but allow another with a different palate to possibly enjoy  i like it more every time i drink it it burns and numbs my mouth more than other ten year olds of similar proof only a little smoke and peat nicely sweet but not cloying a little vegetal after taste but not nasty for the same price i can buy one of several older single malts that i like better that said i 39 d not turn this one down if it was offered to me  as far as peat amp smoke go there are many better alternatives i like the arrival its quite unique don 39 t like the finish offputting soapy note  one reviewer placed talisker 10 between laguvulin 16 and ardberg 10 these just happen to be my top three single malts though talisker 10 has an extra bonus of being about 20 00 less the flavor of peat and smoke i enjoy so much seems to increase from talisker 10 to laguvulin 16 to ardberg 10 as an additional note to my taste the laphroiag 10 is just off the charts with peat smoke and not sure what else also i found glenmorangie to lack the peat and smoke and to be on the sweet side  the talisker 10 has turned into a favorite with great value to boot i was turned off by scotch for many years until introduced to a fine ballantine 39 s 17 blend by a pro in the business this was the beginning of an odyssey which has led me to the realization that the scotches which i had revolted against were swill and to enjoy a whiskey of immense enjoyment required a larger investment hence i was led to the likes of lagavulin 16 and special distillers editions ardberg ugadeil glenlivet 18 mccallen 15 glenmorangie 18 etc and by chance tried the talisker 10 and lo and behold a gem at a reasonable price peat but sweet with a smooth finish  i recently revisited this whisky after a few years and still found it a great dram it 39 s a decent peated single malt and hard to beat at the price on offer at waitrose at the time of purchase strangely enough i remember this fondly as one of the first single malts i tired as a student geologist on a field trip to the isle of rum it was one of the few decent drinks behind the little bar at kinloch castle along with arran ale and i can directly attribute it to the start of my whisky voyage and for my penchant for peat  this is whisky heaven for me the best tasting malt whisky for the price i have not found a better one than this peat smoke and malt all in one bottle i will always buy this fantastic 10 year old to treat myself  i 39 m a middle aged man 42 and long time appreciator of the spirits but only started sampling pricey scotch recently talisker 10 is my fave so far after having tried lagavulin 16 the glenlivet 12 and laphroaig 10 not sure i can offer taste descriptions of scotch any better than i could with wine alls i know is that i find some things more pleasant to drink than others for being 45 8 alc this stuff is surprisingly mild and smooth the lagavulin and laphroiag might have been a bit too strongly flavored for a noob like myself sometimes drinking a spirit neat will be too much for my gullet and it gives me an involuntary gag sensation in the back there which is very unpleasant this stuff goes down real smooth and with some maple syrup sweetness i 39 ve more brands to try but talisker agrees with me most thus far and may become my 39 house 39 scotch and for any fellow americans i looked up 39 tcp 39 and i gather it 39 s a widely used oral antiseptic in the uk had to check after a few reviewers mentioned the product in comparison  got a liter at porter airlines toronto duty free shop as i like to experiment with differing scotches what a pleasant surprise talisker is much like highland park my personal favorite a touch of islay and a smooth tasty highland talisker will be a fine addition to the arsenal for future special operations  before there was a stupid shaken martini there was a bond who drank talisker i had my first drink after reading a recommendation to try the smoky wonder of scotch simply superb i am usually a one scotch man mostly drinking beer to fill in the time this was heaven woke up this morning and felt a bit odd only to realize i had drank half the bottle wonderful intoxicating and full of flavor but tight in my throat had to keep to nips of the stuff otherwise my throat would react non favorably beauty in a bottle  this one got better towards the middle of the bottle the intense smokiness must 39 ve diluted overtime with oxidation i first started adding water to this as was recommended but then learned how much better it is without any water it leaves such a delicious after taste that lasts and lasts leave your glass overnight with the last drops and the next morning you 39 ll have maple syrup aromas just in time for pancakes  forgot to rate it below  this is one of the most outstanding tasting malts for the price superb whisky with loads of peat smoke amp malt i always look forward to opening this bottle when i treat myself and the taste has never changed and is fantastic will always buy thankyou talisker  awesome whisky talisker 10 was the scotch i 39 d be searching for awhile it tastes like highland park 12 43 version without the bacon smoked meat flavor lots of extra smoke and power this scotch is very smoky but doesn 39 t have that much peat flavour like laphroaig if you 39 re looking for a well priced scotch that has a highland character with lots of power and smoke this is for you when i say it has no peat flavour what i mean is it doesn 39 t have a fermented vegetal note like in laphroaig  am i the only one who thinks talisker 39 s once bold distinctive character has been toned down to such an extent that it now tastes like one of any number of whiskies did i get a wrongly labelled bottle of storm are my taste buds finally giving up after drinking malt whisky for 40 years still a nice dram but  i am a big fan of peated whiskies but i have not warmed to this at all very bitter almost a bile type after taste i really like talisker storm but not this luckily only bought a small bottle  one of my all time favourite drams just amazing  i 39 m really not a fan of peaty smoky whisky my dad and father in law both love laphroig and i 39 ve had a couple of glasses with them but would never choose it for myself at a recent wedding i was bought a glass of tallisker and loked forward to tasting a new one for me on the nose was the dreaded peat and smoke to the point that ithought it was laphroig and suggeted we had been given the wrong whisky having been assured this was what we had ordered i had a taste and was very pleasantly surprised it was peat and smoke but not too much it took a few sips to get used to but i genuinely enjoyed it later in the evening another friend presented me with aglass that turned out uto be tallisker and i enjoyed it more than the first i don 39 t think i 39 m ready to buy bottle of the stuff yet but this might very well be my route into this style of whisky does anybody really enjoy their first beer or whisky these things are acquired tastes and tallisker will probably make this process all the easier  i love my peaty scotches and thus fell in love with talisker the last reviewer hit the nail on the head there is a great pepper taste that comes through with the smoke the finish is very long and this has become one of my favorite drams being a peat lover i immediately loved this whisky i was quite surprised by the taste of pepper i had previously read it in reviews but i didn 39 t expect such a strong flavour citrus notes are present as well as salt smoke and peat are not as strong as a laphroaig 10 but it is highly enjoyable  i have been drinking single malts for 10 years and as a scotsman have tried a fair few but just keep going back for more talisker i have recently tried the skye and storm and although enjoyable they are just not on the same level as the 10 year old there is no other malt in the 10 year old bracket as i sit here with the stove burning away i can only say the feeling of pure satisfaction talisker gives is unrivalled in my opinion talisker is what single malt scotch should be although i regard laphroaig not a midges ball hair behind talisker  i am the classic clich 233 started off with an aberfeldy 12 really nice and mellow then a dalwhinnie 15 slightly underwhelming then a highland park einar lovely then an arran 14 absolutely awesome i thought however it was time to step up as others have advised i bought a talisker 10 first dram i thought 39 this is weird and i am not sure 39 then by the second dram i was instantly hooked on the peaty medicinal taste and realised that all the previous whiskeys regardless of region were really different versions of the same drink whereas this was something new and i think i am addicted i am now off to buy the ardbeg 10 and looking forward to that first dram then it will be a lagavullin 16 i tried this a couple years ago i remember it being smokey salty deliciousness i happily took a liter home from a duty free and it tastes nothing like i remember it 39 s like antiseptic mouthwash iodine terrible bitter aftertaste sucks they either changed it or i got a bad batch waste of 70 bucks  initial reaction can it really be supposed to taste like that final verdict yes it can  brother in law gave a balance bottled of this to me its was the best single malt ever tasted awesome smokey taste and strong body and complex yet complete bottle i just opened smelled like medicine and taste like medicine could not place it until reading some old review mothballs antiseptic iodine i love my single malt i will accept that this is good but think there may be a quality control issue my review is not the first mention of this  best i have tasted drinking this makes me feel like a viking i love it  picked this up at my local liquor store about a week ago and waited about a week after opening to drink a nice glass of it and wow i am impressed a perfect amount of peat smoke that gets rinsed off your tongue by a splash of salt water spectacular and quite balanced not super complex but excellent nonetheless not as peppery as expected but i almost prefer that sometimes i feel the pepper can take away from the smoke and the brine but not here would definitely buy again and looking forward to try another dram from talisker well done i had bought this bottle a year back and really enjoyed it however i received a bottle of talisker 18 as a gift for the holidays that bottle absolutely blew my mind as all the classic talisker flavors are so perfectly presented in that bottle now coming back to this 10 year old expression i have a newfound appreciation for it it 39 s got everything the 18 year old has it 39 s just a bit less focused more of a bruiser you could say this is an extremely flavorful whisky up there with some of the bruisers from islay like lagavulin and arbeg but the peatiness of this whisky is beautifully integrated into a lovely rich sweetness that combine to make that signature talisker flavor if you are making the journey through single malts and haven 39 t tried talisker yet you need to this is where to start unless you can spring for the 18  i tried this back in my twenties at the king 39 s head in winnipeg i remember enjoying its potency i bought a bottle a month ago and cracked her open last night medium peat smoke from the bottle emanating the nose has peat smoke cinnamon cardamom and golden raisins the palate medium smokiness and then bam intense white hot pepper that fades into mackintosh 39 s caramel the finish is long for a 10 year old with smoke oak and simple syrup i picked this up in seoul for a surpisingly good price i 39 m very happy mark from winnipeg seoul this is a great earthy mineral style scotch with the perfect amount of peat fantastic to begin with let explain my seemingly eclectic palate my favorite whiskies are glenfarclas all years oban 14 lagavulin 16 tomatin 18 and now talisker 10 i don 39 t have the knowledge of more sophisticated scotch drinkers and can 39 t explain about quot tarry rope quot flavors and the like because for one thing i 39 ve never eaten a tarry rope but i do know what i like and really like this whisky i bought my first bottle a few days ago and it is now finished and i will buy more enough said  i 39 m really not a big fan of peaty whiskies the glenfarclas line are my favorites but i really like this whisky i bought a bottle a few days ago and i finished it of last night the more i drank the more i liked it i really can 39 t explain why i just know what i like as of now my favorites are glenfarclas 10 12 and 17 oban 14 lagavulin 16 tomatin 18 and now talisker 10 can anyone out there explain my palate to me it all seems to be pretty eclectic i 39 m not a very sophisticated scotch man yet and really can 39 t go into detail about quot tary ropes quot and other flavors because i 39 ve never ate a tary rope i can relate to quot nutty quot vanilla quot oak smoke etc  palete taste range sharp alcohol peat peaty smoke barley increased thickness round sweetness salty and sweet long finish what a balance between peaty smoke and sweet salt but it is a teaser for your tastes i am new to malts but love this one found it on discount in supermarked how to enjoy to relaxation after long hard day at work prefer to sip it neat from small glass i highly recomment this one at least buy this one before the other taliskers  i 39 m not a lover of the traditional islay peaty powerhouses however i just tried a sample of this talisker 10 from skye and it is surprisingly well balanced and beautifully peated understandably peat is a very polarizing note some love it others hate it i feel this one could easily appeal to both from a neat pour there 39 s plenty of peat smoke cinnamon sugar sweetness barbeque sauce and sea salt on the nose the palate is round and smooth the chaps are right there is an ashy and peppery quality there but they 39 re wrong on one thing it 39 s not that intense despite a slight soapiness and medicinal note in the aftertaste this dram was quite enjoyable if you like talisker 10 but want to taste around try the bowmore 15 darkest similar flavour profiles but the bowmore has a few extra years to build some sweeter sherried characteristics that i think play quite well with the peat  i mean no disrespect as i do appreciate talisker 39 s products but i do think the 10yo has changed over the past couple of years it doesn 39 t have as much depth and complexity that being said talisker 18 is still divine  this is delicate taste whisky medium smokey it smells amazing peat salt i like to breath him  very smooth for a 10 year old great peaty presentation best with 10 drops of water and let it sit for 10 15 minutes before enjoying  first night with this bottle was confusing the mouthfeel was hollow and every flavor was overshadowed by a vicious chemical note it was a rough ride from start to finish where maybe 1 10 sips showed some hope that my money was not wasted i wasn 39 t discouraged because i enjoy interesting experiences but i knew if this bottle continued on the current path there was no way i would ever purchase a second bottle fortunately given some time the bleach like whisky was replaced with a gentle but flavorful tonic its a balanced blend of peat and fruit with a hint of the medicinal i don 39 t agree with the masters of malt tasting notes as it makes it sound like a full islay experience when they say quot full bodied with huge plumes of smoke quot my bottle comes off more like a hybrid whisky for people turned off by the sometimes overpowering flavors of an islay whisky talisker 10 might be a nice adventure  talisker 10 year truly is the power in that old green label and i actually enjoyed it way more if you miss green label like i did this is going to be a peaty kick of nostalgia  i 39 m usually really not one for the darker whiskeys yet this is one of the few that i really like talisker 10 taste to me like johnnie walker black yes makes sense because it 39 s the same parent company but it is a dead ringer on the eye nose amp palate so why pay twice the price it 39 s good scotch but yeah i 39 ll just buy two jwb next time 6 stars for the price difference save money and just buy jwb  ok i stole a bottle of laphroiag 10 off my dad in the summer he 39 s not a whisky drinker so it 39 s ok i found it difficult to drink at first but then it clicked the tcp dettol reaction that you all mention was also my initial thought but then you grow to love it after finishing that off this talisker was recommended to me i bought it this morning and i 39 ve yet to open it i 39 m new to single malts and to this posher end of the whisky scale but i 39 m so looking forward to opening this baby tonight i 39 ll rate it once i 39 ve had a few  i have had to wait until i reached 80 to be given a bottle what kept my spendthrift family so long if i remind them i have birthday in february do you think they might have a whip round for another bottle one can only live in hope m j c  even for a beginner like me this is not too quot islay quot enough peat amp smoke whiff of honey salt from the air seaweed some black pepper spice at the finish wow for the price definitely one bottle of this in my cabinet  my first touch with talisker 10 yo was a couple of years ago in a pub in london where i was on a vacation the taste was too strong for me having in mind that i 39 m in use with stronger drinks than the average from where i come later a got a bottle of it from my wife for my b day and i can say that after sever 39 conversations 39 with that bottle it turned to be one of my favorites so far like it more than lagavulin for not being so much peated love to enjoy it at home in the cold days while reading a book on the couch and every drop seems to be a true pleasure looking forward for the next one d  it tastes like a cross between lagavulin 16 and ardbeg 10 it 39 s not a good thing or a bad thing just an in between whisky  smells and tastes okay to start then the aftertaste if i wanted to drink medicine dettol i needn 39 t pay 163 30 for the privilege of calling buying this whiskey yuck  i 39 m afraid i have to agree with andy 39 s first assessment this offering has more in common with industrial effluent than whiskey my wife loves it so i have tried it on a number of occasions very difficult to get past the 39 nose 39 stage without gagging each to his own i know and i have tasted worse i couldn 39 t finish the free sample at the old fettercairn distillery  first tasted talisker on a visit to the distillery some 30 years ago at the tender age of 17 can 39 t even remember what it tasted like and part from a few glenfid 39 s haven 39 t really done whiskey for a very long time memories stirred seeing it in the shop and a bottle came home i can 39 t give you palate descriptions i have no idea on that score but if it 39 s your first taste let me describe it so you won 39 t be surprised imagine you are on the end of cold and windy wharf and the local fishing trawler has just returned pulling along side the skipper hits reverse and you get a mouthful of diesel fumes fish salt spray and you breathe get taken away just a touch that 39 s your first taste of talisker no wonder some hate it but take that your home and the warmth of the peat fire is upon you that 39 s the true talisker think hard life history and the elements no soft highland tartan and civility here embrace it  it is one of our favourite malts but what on earth is volcanic peat  i got a bottle of this for christmas from my wife on my first taste i found it very strong and almost bitter think it was just my tastebuds going into shock on my second glass i grew to enjoy it and when this bottle is finished i will buy another  nice quot punch quot but to much caramel horreble mouthfeel ok value  right then i am now going to be man enough to back pedal on my last review i previously stated that the best place for this whiskey was down the sink well to be honest i have changed my view in the last few days when i first tried talisker i had been drinking standard type mild flavored whiskey and tried talisker straight afterwards do that and you will also have the same shock effect on your taste buds i am now on my 2nd bottle of 20cl talisker that i could not impose upon my friends as gifts and to be honest i am now starting to enjoy it i am now giving them some 20cl bottles of jura whiskey that is very pleasant from the outset to be honest now i have got over the shock smell and taste of talisker i have got to admit that i would indeed buy it again for myself i find it best neat with no ice or water or any other additive i never thought i would say this so soon but you might just have a convert  had a nip of talisker last night have to agree with andy dreadful taste of industrial chemicals more like drinking tcp than whiskey  i have been drinking whiskey for over 30 years i bought some 20cl bottles for presents so decided to open one to see what it was like my goodness what a shock it tastes like bad medicine or cleaning fluid i have never tasted anything like it i cannot impose that on my friends best place for this shit is down the sink sorry but that is my opinion  very smoky powerful taste not for the faint of heart definitely has a sea water kind of aroma in there the first time i opened the bottle i was astonished by the burnt smell that emanated from it and the taste stayed true to this first impression i did not like this scotch 2 weeks later and half a bottle later i either got used to the taste or the bottle got used to me i 39 m still not sure which but this is some fine scotch for sure the only problem is that now the highland park 12 bottle i bought alongside this one lies untouched in the cupboard for being too watery and dull  i was given an unwanted bottle of this stuff by a chap at work who knew i liked a nip of scotch he said he had tried it and described it as quot paint stripper quot well i think it 39 s superb a masterpiece and ridiculously inexpensive for what you get it has far more substance and authority than black bush and is much easier to drink than highland park but somehow beats each at their own game  this was the first bottle i bought from from this range from talisker and what a great whiskey this is 10 10 for me just finished my first glass of this prepared by swirling filtered water in my glass dumping it out then adding whiskey for just a few drops of water to open the nose i can tell this is a whiskey i will be keeping in my cabinet without question this carries the peaty flavors through from the malting process so if you don 39 t like peat this is not for you stick to the many lovely non peated scotch whiskeys such as glenmorangie 18 or aberlour 12 however this is nowhere near as peaty as my all time favorite lagavulin 16 or the iconic laphroiag 10 this talisker is much quot easier quot to enjoy relative to lagavulin the intensity of the peat is maybe 35 as great meaning this would be easier to have more regularly not just when i 39 m quot in the mood quot as is the case with lagavulin or laphroiag the briny flavors imparted from the sea spray passing through the open windows and impregnating the casks in talisker 39 s aging room is a delightful addition to the palette here as another commented the finish is in my opinion rather short one of the weaknesses here level of complexity would be another so i 39 d award it gold rather than double gold highly recommend  this is a tough whisky as the ancient scots said it and remarkably divisive i 39 m new to it i bought it on the way to a gig and looked forward to it all evening when i got home i threw a few logs on the thankfully still burning fire and poured a glass my first impression was that i 39 d made a terrible mistake it tasted medicinal and much too rough i found myself wanting another taste however the more i sipped the more i began to appreciate the roughness of this wonderful whiskey it somehow makes you feel like you 39 re tasting history you can imagine generations of islanders sitting by their fires being simultaneously warmed from the cruel northern scottish weather talisker 10 year has to be one of the better 10 year ols single malts out there on the not so delicate nose i find sea wood sweet fruit and a bit smoke the first touch in the mouth is an explosion of taste where one could distinguishe the pallete the finish is long and fades slowly not a dram for sunny days but it fits perfectly on the winterevenings i would say the talisker is a highland park 12 on steroids  very good  these reviews are great both the lovers and the haters i m among the former btw makes learning about scotch that much more fun  absolutely love the smokey peaty taste  aroma of sea spray and smoke dunvegan on a winter night the taste is peat and smoke and it finishes with a bang not a whimper this is not a whisky for the faint hearted but then neither is the isle of skye  it smells amazing but then you taste it it s not a good whiskey i just picked up a bottle of talisker 10yo for 70 because i had never tried talisker before my flat opinion as a peat and bourbon lover this is a very very weak whiskey it has a smooth smoky nose and a very pleasant malty arrival but that s as far as it went for me the development was very mild and the finish was almost nonexistent when i m drinking an expensive peated whisky i at least want a nice long finish if this was a 40 whisky i would have very little to complain about what i ended up doing with it was yes this may make some of you cringe blending it with some high end bourbon 2 3rds talisker 1 3rd high end bourbon now after blending it then it actually became something very very good the bourbon helped drag out the finish in the most amazing way so the only reason this even gets 2 stars it because for me personally it was somewhat saved by blending it  in my opinion it s a must have for your big three no mather what happen i like to keep a bottle of talisker laphroaig qc and a lagavulin 12 it tells you how i valued this scotch smoky peated and heavy salt the nose is just incredible close your eyes take a whiff and you can almost feel yourself sitting on the sideseas cliffs of scotland with the waves crashing into the rock however i have found out it s not the best to match with a cigar it completly messes with the palate have a more smoky oriented scotch like bowmore or ardbeg or a heavy coal laproaig for your week end cigar have a good one  smoke overwhelmed everything experimented with adding more and more water a bit at a time to no avail nose smoke taste smoke finish ash tray with notes of death i like a dram with a hint of smoke but i m more for the light fruity floral whiskeys so if you re the same avoid this one however if a smoky whiskey is your thing i can highly recommend it because that is exactly what you will get  comes along confident and strong but is already gone before you ve really met just a bit too boisterous for my taste i guess but still nice enough for the odd occasion  i m very fond of this oaken smokey dram that sets itself up as a late night whisky you can take a view here that talisker dosen t compete with islay malts but parallels and bests them with salty depth this has become my go to malt for peat amp smoke and to be honest there always seems to be a tally in that mahogany cabinet next to the green leather chesterfield in the walnut wood wrapped cigar smelling office down a cul de sac in the house of lords my life hasn t worked out that well but this whisky gives me that feeling  do not pay any attention to some of the bad reviews of this whisky it is certainly not for everyone but for those who look for a powerful but flavorful dram of scotch whisky this is for you granted it is an acquired taste i started with the sweeter sherried scotches such as macallan 12 but once you get used to the peat and smoke you are hooked this is very very good whisky it is rich strong earthy salty smoky sweet goodness in a bottle you need to try this i love highland park 12 but this steps it up a bit it is wild and wonderful  more heft than speyside but not quite the complexity of the great islay drams like ardbeg and laphroaig a bit medicinal all that said damn fine whiskey  fairly new to scotch but have tried quite a few highland park 12 being my favorite at this point decided to venture out into the heavier flavors of peat and smoke heard so much about the talisker being a good starting point i must say that it is just fabulous the color is a beautiful amber the nose is marvelously smoky and to me caramel and maple the taste well i love it i could be happy with this from now on and it is very reasonably priced talisker 10 is a very very good scotch whisky  both the missus and i enjoyed talisker as our first scotch when i was stationed in the uk probably the most drank scotch for us love the smokey smooth dram  a big departure from my usual choices of speysides and bourbon i thought i d try something different i bought a bottle and have struggled to finish a single finger i can t get past the taste of smoked kipper to taste anything else and 5 minutes after having my first few sips my breath smells like i ve been gargling petrol anyone fancy swapping for a half empty bottle of aberlour  the rugged and beautiful west coast of scotland in a glass not as extreme as an islay a briny salt amp pepper powerhouse that never fails to deliver wave after wave of maritime malt character simply one of the best but not for everyone  talisker 10 year old the best enough said  once i first discovered the smoke in scotch i could never go back to the unpeated varieties highland park 12 was my first foray and wow was i hooked after that i wanted to try everything i could get my hands on unfortunately i m not rich but luckily the neighborhood pub has around 200 bottles i know lucky me once i finally got a round to the talisker 10 the hp was no longer my fave talisker is such a great dram there will always be a bottle on my shelf  i only got this because i had heard it was a smokier whisky but was dissapointed in this respect i found it wasn t anywhere near as smokey or quot woodsy quot as laphroiag 10 for example  my first smokier malt i recieved as a gift and i have to say i realy like it not as quot hard quot as the connemara turf mor so easier accessible enjoy  классика  i really like it i cautiously bought a drink at the red fox inn in virginia first ha but i enjoyed it so i got a bottle it is smokey not as smokey as some to me i would rate it high middle the apple taste is there though however not at all too sweet i am not a bourbon or irish drinker for that reason we re under tornado watches here in north alabama so i got a wee dram of my newly bought bottle i mean if you are going to be blown away  burns said whisky as i conceive it means islay talisker or glenlivet so it has a heritage and is much more interesting than most whisky s of its age but is you want ultra peat stick to islay this is only a suggestion of peat  love talisker 10 plain and simple  i discovered the diversity and complexity of whisky a year ago and at first didn t like the peated malts however as my palate and appreciation for whisky has developed i am beginning to really enjoy the smoky varieties i m just back tonight from a friend s who had bought in glenmorangie a lovely light sweet whisky and a 10 year old talisker for us to try after a dram of each i was surprised to find i preferred the talisker to my perception it gives initial sweet fruity notes with an overall layer of smoke and with kippers and salt finish lovely sweet salty mix complex and satisfying very enjoyable more intriguing and not so straightforward as the albeit lovely in itself glenmorangie  talisker 10 years old produced by talisker distillery islands has matured for at least 10 years in oak with an abv of 45 80 the whisky is deep amber in color and visually clear with moderate depth to it on the nose it has medium intensity medium complexity with aromas of apple iodine seaweed kipper pungent and smoke on the palate it is unctuous and slightly sweet with flavors of barley brine iodine peat smoke pepper honey and sherry the whisky is of full body balanced with a dry long 7 secs finish tasting notes generated by whisky vibe app  not as brutal on the senses as your laphroaigs and ardbegs but a very nice scotch nonetheless a good place to start out if you wish to try peated scotch if this is too full on for you then steer clear of the islay lot  drinking this whiskey reminds of the tale of the emperor has no clothes for people are just afraid to admit the truth that this is just terrible whiskey i m a relative newcomer to smokier malts having quot grown up quot with glenfarclas and cragganmore i wanted to try something a little different my first impression is of smoke and iodine of course but those are pretty round and don t jump out of the profile to kill anything else going on alongside those flavors are green meadow sorts of flavors that reminded me of clover as an aside when i had finished the drink and was smelling the empty glass i got a very clear sea harbor sort of scent  as an irish whiskey drinker i m not overly fond of smokey peaty flavors however i did enjoy the talisker 10 quite a potent drink as it has been said but the flavors are quite distinct from each other creating a evident in the long finish also not overly expensive i would definitely keep a spot on my shelf for it in future  zwaar overroepen deze whisky hoor niet veel beter dan de gemiddelde blend  rather disappointed in last bottle of 10 year i bought march 2014 canada missing the level of peat i have come to expect from them can t detect a lot number on the bottle will i buy it again yes with hope it was simply a bad batch  the people below who state this is the worst whiskey they ever tasted on not scotch drinkers i think they better stick to umbrella drinks because first off this is not a bery smokey or even very peat tasting but for the 12 year or under it s one of the best the negative reviewers should stick to bud light or diet coke because they sure are not scotch drinkers especially if yo can get it for reduced price in supermarkets it is unbeatable i have got bottle before and now i bought another one consistent bottling this is my go to whisky  i like it the slight smoke peaty seaweed lends much character to this whisky the nose is almost intoxicating in itself has a long dry finish that reminds me somewhat of a good cuban cigar this whisky is not for everyone of course  definately the worst whiskey i ever had it smells awful like smoked or burnt pig meat for the second nip i had to hold my breath to even be able to get near it tastes way too spicy smokey has an bitter aftertaste like you just drank some medicine and even the bottle looks weird the package looks nice though  first bottle what an excellent whiskey light peat salt and spice flavours love it  although this had a decent aroma it tastes awful i appreciate a nice smokey peaty malt but this leaves a horrendous aftertaste which i can only compare to a foisty smell it tastes artificial and chemical like to the point where i thought something was wrong with it i can t understand the positive reviews this is the worst i have tasted  never liked peated whisky until i tried this one so much flavour and character  nice dram that balances sweetness and smoke very well everybody has their own view but those that voted this down are wrong plain and simple  a delightful whirlwind of complexity and contradiction in the nose and on the palate peaty smoke infused tastes and smells of the sea married to salted caramel with a nice spicy undercurrent running through it at 45 8 vol 91 6 proof in old money this is one deceptively strong and extremely rewarding dram  i bought a bottle and after three tries this scotch is not for me i don t find it unpleasant just salty and sweet and not very interesting or worthwhile especially when i have a bottle of lagavulin 16 and laphroaig 18 sitting in my liquor cabinet to each his own  the tastes like a late night with a few good friends light low fire burning in the stove talking openly about love and life or just enjoying the old jazz record playing softly in the back those nights that should never end this whisky tastes like those kind of nights share with your best friend  like drinking benzene with phenol dissolved in it tasty  just kidding hey who deleted my previous review unlike laphroaig 10 that tastes like turpentine that caught fire which was put out and then bottled while a bottle of phenol was thrown in accidentally into the cask talisker 10 is less intense i didn t smell much smoke but lots of wood and peat taste is harsh without a little water which smooths it a little giving it a slightly sweet oranges and salty finish so if you are in a foul mood in the evening and want to indulge in some self flagellation pour yourself some talisker 10 to complete the evening s moroseness lagavulin 16 is so much better anand after all the rave reviews i bought a bottle of talisker 10 now i am quite fond of sweeter lighter scotches like the balvenie 17 double wood 21 portwood nd the dalwhinne 15 as well as the peaty smoky scotches like the lagavulin 16 and laphroaig18 talisker 10 a very nice scotch very little smoke but lots of peat in the nose taste is a little raw with oak and some sweetness and quite dry phenol is not that noticeable a very nice scotch but i prefer the lagavulin 16 which is much more tasty and complete  i too cannot stop thinking about my next dram of this remarkable stuff the nose alone is intoxicating it s everything i think of the romance of scotland and scotch  holy cow that s the good stuff to rate  sometimes at night i dream a certain piece of music that is with me when i awake this talisker i find its taste coming to me during the day when i m nowhere near the bottle much like that music i dream a fabulous example of what art man is capable of  this whisky is like the beautiful girl that smiles at you calls you forward and then slaps you in the face as she walks away she turns around and smiles again the smell and look of this whisky all becon you to drink as you draw this drink your lips and start to take it in pow it hits you firm hard and square in face as the sting subsides it calls you back in for another its irresistible and amazing in every way  i had never drank a whisky of this caliber before the start it so immensely up your face heavy turf and pepper taste along with a strong kick powerful enough to make you pour another glass you either like this or you don t it s not for the faint hearted that s for sure bit expensive for a gamble but sometimes you just got the roll the hard six  massive nose crazy apple peels peaty smoke engulfing the palate loads of creosol sharpening things up and lengthening the already never ending barley driven finish amazing  read the reviews there s not a quot 3 quot on the board you either like it or you don t but if you love scotch whiskey then you owe yourself a taste test don t expect a smooth sweet highland malt second barreled in a wine cask or the grassy taste harsh on my taste buds of a lowland malt this is not a scotch for everyone whiskey is not wine forget the nose use your taste buds if you like your women naughty you re gonna love this one i love different kinds of tastes but this one is good and worth repeating i ll get another bottle  put together earwax embalming fluid and a very old antiseptic and there you have it also don t forget a lingering nasty aftertaste that made me wonder all evening how anybody could have there taste buds so screwed up to actually like this stuff  when i was a student i took up smoking a pipe a ridiculous affectation but whatever while i was induling in this habit i bought a brand of tobacco called sobranie nice but strong stuff well having just downed a good measure of talisker i have that same taste but without having had my lungs cleaned with brillo pads glace cherries it is not  i was gifted a bottle of this recently and it s good stuff a nice strong flavour wouldn t say no to another bottle  talisker was first introduced to me about 5 years ago when a group of us chaps were playing fiddle by the sea we would try to describe the experience to each other as we passed around a dram between tunes and chuckles a sheep herders moss covered dirty kilt saved from a camp fire washed in an old iron pot on an open fire then the scorched wool is hung up in a musky old cedar lined closet surrounded with moth balls until dry the tattered band seemed to be all in agreement on the taste yet we couldn t stop adoring the whisky until it was all gone now it s a favorite dram of all times  wow what an absolute treasure came into malt drinking as a fan of floral unpeated whisky but after imbibing on the talisker 10 i feel like the floodgates have opened thick medicinal peat on the nose which gives way to sweetness and spice on the palate lovely warming finish i m off to grab a bottle for the cabinet  always been one of my favourites with its curious peppery edge is it just me or do a lot of the detractors seem to use american spellings and terms flavor sneakers etc perhaps they should just stick to southern comfort and coke  well i must say that this reminds me of kilchoman machir bay but more smooth same smokey peaty nose and taste with a perfect finish if you like this one try kilchoman as well i will be a regular up in the skye if you dont like this then go back to drinking bud light  my wife and i love this malt she calls it quot toffee scotch quot after its long peaty sweet finish must say i have always been a fan and it makes a nice contrast to the islays as its taste quot attack quot forgive the audio terms and peaty quot sustain quot give a more storm swept experience  talisker is awesome the only thing better might be lagavulin the 18 is really good but i don t think its worth the extra if you get a chance go to the distillery on skye saw a whale breech while driving there memorable trip  a must taste for any peat loving palate amazing dram for its price range with the smokiness riding shutgun while sea stuff of all kinds seaweed seawater seasalt take you faraway across turbulent oceans if cthulhu were a whisky this would be it  smells wonderfully sweet on an initial nose i immediately thought of cider and with a lovely smoke but simply too tough on the palate it s a little too strong for my liking despite the relatively modest alcohol content so one for some watering down completely agree with the above comments about a medicinal chemical quality aftertaste is pretty smooth but not enough going on generally i m really confused by all the rave reviews i m off to tuck into the distiller s edition  best whiskey i have ever had  the smoked element to this whisky is absolutely foul i can t help but think something has gone seriously wrong as it just tastes of burnt plastic i forced down a measure telling myself it would get better but quite frankly it made me feel ill i cannot fathom how people can enjoy this whisky and can only assume that the good reviews are marketing plants  peat forward whiskies such as laphroaig lagavulin talisker etc are not for the faint hearted it is a classic whisky in every right and is what a whisky should be right now floral sweet light and boutique bottlings of fragrant multi wood casks are all the rave because they re feminine and dessert like cragganmore talisker oban lagavulin glenkinchie and dalwhinnie are the quot classics quot they are meant to warm you up on a cold scottish night the smokiness makes it pair exceptionally well with food and it is fairly complex despite being 10 years old although peaty whiskies are best young if you hate this stay away from islay whiskies if you want to like it start drinking blended scotch instead of feminine perfume bottlings i didn t taste a big medicinal bandage rubber saltiness out of talisker as much as laphroaig and lagavulin was saltier and less smoky anyway it s not the whisky it s the drinker  smokey rather than peaty to me very enjoyable would buy again  took neat in a proper glass extra strong at nose before sip halfway stage mixed 20cc of water smoothened out sweet lingering and peppery at the back forces you to think very good   well maybe i should say that this is my first quot superior quot whiskey so i am not sure if i am able to judge but i would like to say that it was good decision for this whiskey i really love that smoke and spicy taste price performance ratio is just awesome  at first this whiskey seems almost salty like seaweed but the salty ocean like taste makes way for a smokey leathery nose and an equally smokey taste along with the addition of tangy peat an overall pleasure to drink however given a choice between this and oban i would have to pick the latter over the years i have sampled a relatively large number of single malts though thankfully i am nowhere near even halfway through those available and i must admit that while i have developed a distinct preference for some laphroaig dalwhinnie15 even a bowmore on occasion i just can not get past the peppery rough taste of a talisker given my open armed appreciation naturally with varying degrees of enthusiasm for just about every other single malt i have tried it s a curious thing it tastes to me only perhaps like a good single malt that has been tampered with puts me in a minority i suppose but there you go  awesome depth and complexity the very best in its class imo  tcp  yes but not in a good way simply tastes like tcp i can compare it to nothing else i ve ever tried really disappointed  a powerful whisky to be tamed if not love at first be patient you ll be surprised  love the notes for a 10 yr old lots of charecter that may seem heavy for many especially the for ones in the likes of the glenfiddich 15 and 18 yr notes this is in with laphroaig agree with one review it is hard to beleive its a 10yr as it has the maturity of a 12 or 15 yr and that many of those 12 and 15 struggle to have an unbelievable 10yr  i never drunk a whisky like this in my life total failure a beautiful whisky i adore laphroaig and am glad to add this to my short list of favorites phenolics are tuned back a little and the spiciness steps up if you cannot appreciate this well then give it one star and declare that you are not a whisky drinker  this one doesn t go unnoticed very recognisable shared it with a friend and had the best week end love the salt the pepper the peat and man that attitude  talisker 10yr to me seems to be in predicament the green apple and sage in the nose are completely overwhelmed by an aggressive alcohol note it genuinely burned my nostrils and the pleasant toffee apple herbal taste of the mouth are shadowed by heavy burnt peat and black smoke which mellow into a really satisfying finish a real rollercoaster whisky i think it benefits from more water than usual to extract what it does well  the whisky is top notch full of pepper and peat  too smoky and peaty try laphroig this is a very good bottle i love it maybe ever so slightly too strong but well can t really complain about that  it s very good whisky if you want something with some balanced kick well then try it it will wake you up and appreciate whisky with a little attitude unless you re a smooth whisky snob  i like it smoky and peaty some spicy excellent whisky this  this is one of the very great whiskies if you can only give it one star you know nothing about whiskey  i can understand why some who are new to whisky do not like talisker 10 as much as some others i put this down to its rather fearsome delivery which to the unaccustomed can appear somewhat too much like many of the islay drams talisker is from skye but the comparison is valid it requires a certain amount of initiation before its full enjoyment can be achieved easily achieved by drinking more whisky talisker for me encapsulates scotland in a glass its like a big scotsman walking up to you in his kilt and giving you a big fat whisky kiss add a heather moorland windy island location and you get the picture its fantastic stuff for me perhaps the best 10 year old single malt out there only the 18 year old surpasses it in my book  it s certainly not awful but this has a somewhat rank flavor in the midpalate that clashes horribly with chocolate mousse it s a yeast like somewhat chemical flavor it might be good alone but do not try to pair it under any condition as it tastes somewhat bizzare  i heard good things about this scotch so decided to spring for a bottle to share with a buddy of mine we both sat down took a sip at first taste it seems like its going to be good until that odd gasoline flavor hits you i could have bought a gallon of gasoline for 3 57 and saved myself a ton of money  how anyone who has actually developed their palate and not respected the mighty talisker not love or at least respect this exception variety staggers the imigination yet not as much as i stagger after drinking this liquid of bliss i have a difficult time stopping once i start this beauty it is the most dangerous liquid i have ever tasted and i have tasted many many varieties the haters must be a different species that amoung us i can not speak to those who drink over the 200 us markbut i can speak to most others try it for yourself but first develope your pallet one path would be glenfiddich18 or 15 to save gt clynelish14 gt oban14 gt talisker10 gt cao ila12 gt laguvalin16move slowly and then back and forth uh take days if not weeks you will know your own mind on the matter  this is one of those whiskys that sends new drinkers running for the jack and coke hills its not by any means quot tasty quot but my god i emptied that bottle faster than anything in my collection it s a smoky almost cooked pork and fish and seawater nose and a tough spicy peppery peaty palate and a finish that makes you think you could speak honey but breathe fire  this whisky far exceeded my expectation for one at this price it s packed full of flavour and has a bit more of a punch with it s slightly higher alcohol level if you want something a bit different to try then this is a good move  i m relatively new to scotch as i ve only been exposed to american bourbons and a few select scotch brands such as johnny walker after becoming a big fan of johnny walker double black i had to try other malts talisker 10 is so far my favorite i just tried ardbeg uigeadial which is very good 4 out of 5 but i m going to have to say talisker 10 gives me everything i m looking for from nose to finish i can t wait to try many other malts laphroaig 10 is next  i can understand this not being for everyone but having been a scotch fan for many a year the talisker 10 has become my go to i particularly like it after a steak dinner  see above  a friend and i recently began our journey into single malt whiskey talisker 10 was the second one we tried at first i was a little unsure but as we sipped our way though we realised we were on to something very special acquired taste you need to aquire the taste as it is a beaut and shouldn t be missed  spicy and sweet a very good whisky you have to try it  im still unsure of how this has changed theres something nusual about how ir progresees its not right  absolutely superb my favourite in the price range i liken it to water as it slips down so easily dick clark  like teen spirit nicely balanced smokiness with sweetness this is a bargain other brands are charging twice what talisker want for comparable whiskies  i don t know that everyone else is drinking but this is horrible opened the bottle and all i smelled was gauze from a medicine cabinet tried a couple of glasses to give it the benefit of the doubt and very medicinal tasting like no other ready to pour it down the drain  i am a huge fan of talisker 10 for ten years since i was gifted a bottle for my 30th i confess though i take it with ginger and love it it is the foundation of my interest in whisky i ll try the oban as its the penultimate quot classic quot on the list for me bottoms up  one of the best whiskies in my opinion would recommend to any whisky lover  unequivocally the best value scotch in its class most reviews from reasonable sources are spot on with regards to their tasting notes huge peaty nose peppery spicy full palate and massive lingering finish that warms your soul tasting through a riedel single malt glass excellent  we have a winner  at first i hated the taste of this whiskey but after time the more you drink it the better it gets one of the best whiskeys i have ever had the pleasure to taste to all te haters please get the bottle out and have a glass with dry ginger you will be supprised  you ll love or hate this very peaty and so rich i was sold at the first sip absolutely i will never forget this classic new friend  liked it quite a bit  in my opinion the best 10 yr old malt you can get from any scottish distillery it s remote location on the isle of skye in quot the shadow of the cuillin ridge quot may seem rather romanticised and irrelevant but it does have a mark on the whisky powerful smoke powerful peat and some darker richer notes of winter fruits spice and black pepper underlying rich sea salt are the prevalent elements of this whisky the maritime nature is more like a stormy bay it is hard to describe this malt as it is so unique definitely an acquired taste in building up to this malt i would suggest the oban 14 yr old and perhaps a couple of islay malts i like port charlotte and laphroaig overall an incredible malt  the best 50 scotch in the world unless you don t like peat smoke i had this half an hour ago and i can still comfortably taste it in a good way it is fantastic stuff easier to drink than other 10 year olds and a real surprise with the enjoyablitlity of the smokey taste wow this is a good one top two scotchs i have tasted  my first heavily peated malt although it seemed a bit rough at 1st i eventually had to acknowledge that this is well made whisky like switching from an amstel light to a duvel for all you beer drinkers powerful yet balanced nice peppery finish  my first heavily peated malt although it seemed a bit rough at 1st i eventually had to acknowledge that this is well made whisky like switching from an amstel light to a duvel for all you beer drinkers powerful yet balanced nice peppery finish  there s no such thing as a bad whisky some are just better than others and this one is simply the best  it s good i like it more of a slow sipper i do like the fruity sweet easy drinking scotches of speyside but if you want thick flavor and powerful notes this one is balanced and not as strong as laphroaig a good buy if you dont like fine but dont bash on talisker ive past the isle of skye many a time amp also through the kyle of lochalsh for me talisker is simply the best starting with a beautiful balance of peat sea amp the slightly medicinal flavour only islay malts portray then a long lasting taste mere words can t describe how good it is amp a real bargain  i have toured many distillaries and tasted many whiskeys and this is by far the best yet  this is superb nose metallica even some mozart palate thin in water but thick on taste despite the 45 8 more notes of mozart metallica finish a bad day when the bottle is what a waste of money other whiskeys are chill people yes let s have this at cask strength as well great when smoking a smokey type smoke thing pseudo intellectual ridiculous person you are  without a doubt the best whiskey i have tasted to date smooth and silky pure nectar one of the loveliest whiskies i have tasted i always buy a bottle at christmas when i m relaxing at home you get more than what you pay for with this one  an excellent dram and super smooth for a 10 yr old and best drunk like bourbon at near body temp quite sweet then the spice kicks in it is slightly smokey and if you are not keen on the smoke then do not breath in when sampling a good intro for the islay monsters that will undoubtedly follow skye s only distillery and one of scotland s best struth  a fascinating and warming interplay between peat lemon apples and wood probably the best price in its category  nice whisky for the price hope the company do not lower the quality as it gets popular  i am happy to admit that i am completely new to the whisky world a friend gave me a mini bottle of this to try and oh my what a beautiful dram i don t have to go into tasting notes as its all covered what i will add is that if i can appreciate the uniqueness and damned awesomeness of a dram why can t an avid malt drinker simple this is most likely has a marmite affect you either love it or hate it  dear simple the worst please send me your bottle of unwanted talisker as i shall gladly drink it this is my particular favourite whisky bit strong for some but nector of the gods to others  one of the very best in scotland they call it the taste of the sea and i agree slightly smokey but not overpoweringly so slighly sweet but not too obviously great quality for a reasonable price  i ve tried lots of whiskies to see if the reputation of talisker 10 is a bit exaggerated but every time i keep returning to this one of the best whiskies around regardless of price or age and at this price it s an absolute bargain just as good as the 18 year old in my opinion  simply the best in its class plant a bottle with me when i m gone  at first i was very impressed with the value then the tcp medicinal after taste took over and really bugged me after most drams so much so that the risk is too much and i prefer a safer bet such as the laphraig quarter casks it has fantastic reviews too  funny review above but he seriously needs to have a word with his palate this stuff is simply delicious  a great example of an islay whisky a light sea breeze start then a good kick of smooth smoke and medicine and a long lingering finish of tobacco and oak sorry i hate to say this sort of thing but if you hate this dram i don t see how you can like whisky maybe you re on the wrong drink  seriously if the glass is warmed first by boiling water then this is simply superb the heat takes the edge off and liberates the flavour and smell taking this to thailand as my small piece of home abroad  description was absolutely spot on good tangy peat smokey with a lasting taste that was pleasant vividly reminded me of my time in scotland  i m not really a fan of peaty whiskies but this one isn t bad got a bottle cheap and thought i d give it a go  i loved this whisky unbeatable with a cigar i found it smooth and smokey my whisky of choice for those moaning about it being awful if you live in leicester i ll gladly come round and buy your bottles off you mark c i was offered a sample of talisker at a recent sailing event and the whisky was smooth to the palate and pale gold in colour i was given a 2 voucher off my next bottle and purchasaed a bottle soon after alas the content of my bottle does not match that of the saqmple and despite in depth enquiries with the producers it hasn t solved why my sample is not same as bottle hence the title of firewater for that is what is in the bottle i will not be buying it again  i was offered a sample of talisker at a recent sailing event and the whisky was smooth to the palate and pale gold in colour i was given a 2 voucher off my next bottle and purchasaed a bottle soon after alas the content of my bottle does not match that of the saqmple and despite in depth enquiries with the producers it hasn t solved why my sample is not same as bottle hence the title of firewater for that is what is in the bottle i will not be buying it again  i was given a sample of talisker at a boat show it was light golden and smooth to the palate so i bought a bottle but oh dear the content of my bottle is likened to firewater and nothing like the wee sample yet i am told there is no difference i know my whiskies and the content of my bottle is definitely not as per sample  talisker 10 is simply the best single malt great bold flavour and aroma this is truly what a single malt is those who do not enjoy talisker 10 lack the palate for a true single malt  it has been my prefered whisky since the first sip  i am a lover of malt whisky but this does not do it for me don t know about smokey it taste disgusting tempted to throw it away as i will never drink it maybe someone will call round who likes it until then it remains in the back of the cupboard and will probably end up in the christmas pudding if no one else likes it  now after 7 months of open bottle my talisker 10 is rich delicious and sweet for the first 6 1 2 months it tasted to me like crawling through the desert dying of thirst with nothing but seawater to drink  what a beautiful drink   strange stuff indeed i see you posted exactly the same on another forum the stupid comments about bottles was probably you as well why do you bother  i have had a liter bottle of this for 5 years now i don t drink much but when i do i like single malts on occasion when this was new it was a bit too much fire for me but now that it has been around for a while it seems to have calmed down a lot last time i had a glass i enjoyed it thoroughly  wow what a beautiful tasting whisky smells good tastes lovely definitely one of the best i ve ever had a true favourite of mine cheers tej riat a smash hit no need to try the other talisker expressions or ages this one beats all  love it the smokiness is obvious but to me it has a sweetness to it as well must be a love it or hate it for anyone to give a low score but i ve not tried anything better i like most single malts interestingly i don t notice any peatiness unless people are describing the smokiness as peatiness  very peated and spicy this dram is not for everyone very powerful and strong or you love it or you hate it  this was disappointing nose metallic off notes palate thin watery despite the 45 8 more off notes metallic bitter caramel e150a taste finish 5 seconds what a waste of money chill filtered caramel colored let s have this at cask strength with a craft presentation  a beautifully balanced whisky if islay highland is to your taste understandably popular  from nose to mouth to eyes to feet this whiskey tops them all this whisky has no balance soot and asphalt am i drinking or resurfacing a road i can see where johnnie walker gets that nasty wang i dispise  after reading some reviews and a recommendation i sprang for a bottle the first taste lingered for a long time and i kept thinking what is that it was more than just the smoky after glow of a house fire there was canvas and rubber in that house then it came to me visually burnt sneakers  cheapest talisker on the web oh yeah talisker is very tasty  nothing else comes close firey and spicey without being overwhelming the best whiskey i have ever tasted  excellant this is one of the best whiskies i ve ever tasted  in a world where we worship the bland and untalented this shines like a beacon as uncompromising and unique love it or hate it this classic single malt should be revered as a superb example of the art of distilling  i like a good strong whisky but this tasted just like a rabbit toasted in lamb i did not like the bottle as it did not look like whisky  excellant cannot see past this talisker 10 for a great easy to enjoy malt with a big body but not too overwhelming great from start to finish 
1912.0, what a depth of flavour for a 12 year old a little on the high price for being 12 years old but worth every penny a bottle that will always be on my shelf fantastic sherried dark fruits long lingering finish with a slight smoke but plenty of dried fruits throughout love this single malt  lovely malt needs a drop of water gets better with time best 12 year old out there very nice price others have already said everything about this whisky i love this whisky and will be purchasing a few more bottles in due course kevdoncaster if there is a better 12 year old malt out there then i 39 m yet to find it  bloody nice tried it for the first time last week it is delicious  12 years old 46 3 natural colour and un chillfiltered four clues on the label that this should be a great dram for me it is a superb whisky complex with oak barrel vanilla a hint of smoke salty sea air dried fruits and nuts tastes like a lot of care has gone into getting all the tastes to balance so well andrew brown distillery manager has his name on the label and very well done to you sir  if you don t like this you don t like scotch the nose alone makes me giddy rich and delicious first it seduces you with that gentle strawberry ice cream like nose and then it bites you with an oaky spicy peppery dark chocolate taste what a dram  a touch of class this cr 232 me br 251 l 233 e for me with beautiful caramel spice a touch of saltiness and of course those fantastic sherry notes love it  horrendous worst whiskey i 39 ve ever tasted all i am getting is a strong taste of alcohol and nothing else  salt on the nose creamy vanilla and some walnut on the palate very impressive  fantastic whisky thick and oily with lovely notes of pickled fruits and a rich smooth finish one of my favorite scotches i love all types of whiskey i love all types of islay this one is sweet and salty almondy and chocolatey fruity and spicy creamy and syrupy it is balanced so perfectly for the price i can get it i always have it on me  this is an absolute gem but please let it breathe at least 5 minutes in the glass a whole new drum just a few drops of water for me is perfect cannot say enough about this lovely whisky this is how good scotch whisky should be bunnahabhain distillery should be congratulated  they say that you don 39 t get something for nothing but thanks to the summerton whisky club that is exactly what we had when this little gem arrived tucked inside the packing box containing this month 39 s whisky of the month it is an absolute gem a total work of art so in gratitude for this unexpected introduction i have just bought a bottle can 39 t say better than that can you  i totally agree with the review below dated 27th dec 2020 well put that person this really is a super whisky beautifully put together  this thing is really good great after dinner dram reminds me of chocolate coffeecake with a baking spices and herbs this is a must buy and it so atypical for an islay scotch no peat no problem this scotch rips 9 10 smell9 10 taste8 10 finish it 39 s a lot of sherry but somehow feels balanced nonetheless beautifully light sweet and savory would 39 ve believed it if you told me it 39 s a speyside it 39 s an unpeated whiskey so idk why so many quot no smoke quot complaints so good that it feels rude to stop at the first dram  a bit too strong and sickly the alcohol is way too powerful yet no smoke compared to lagavulin 16 it 39 s poor even laphroig is better rather overrated wish i 39 d not bought it  tastes like chocolate and caramel with dark fruit thats been lightly roasted on a fire with a slight nutty aftertaste it completely coats the tongue its sweet in a delicious way and complex it smells absolutely wonderful and sniffing this whisky will become addicting it is immediately in my top 5 scotches it doesn 39 t get any better this for a bang for your buck if your looking for a peatly islay scotch look elsewhere like ardbeg but if you are looking for an almost dessert like night cap this is the dram for you if you want you could add a dash or 2 of ardbeg uigeadail and make yourself one of the most complex and tasty blends i 39 ve made its glorious  i love it no afterburn which is nice  i opened my bottle 3 days ago after it had been in my cabinet for about 5 months it left me with a big grin delicously sweet amp fruity from the sherry casks but with a lingerring chocolaty fruity light spicey taste very enjoyable amp slightly suprising i didnt get much salty peaty taste but am going to try again later amp let it sit in the glass for a while i got mine for a great price as i tend to scour supermarket sights for good single malts on offer as they all except lagavulin come round eventually  yes it s awesome there is some western isles peat smoke but it s thick and resinous as well a great combination  it 39 s not often but i 39 ve bought another bottle of this fine spirits it is a telltale of the quality of this whisky imho thank you bunnahabhain i really appreciate this one  person below said it best  this is an outstanding 12 year old one of the best core range 12s available and probably the best overall bang for the buck whisky you can get if you 39 re looking for a cracking sherried daily drinker or a nice whisky gift that doesn 39 t break the bank look no further for my taste there is no better whisky available for under 163 40 sometimes you can catch this on offer for around 163 30 which is a steal it has a pleasingly rich sherry nose with notes of dried fruit and warm spices fantastic mouthfeel smooth and round on the palate with a pleasant sweetness excellent finish with more fruity notes and also nice nutty and exotic fruit flavours when i was tasting it someone said quot foam bananas quot and suddenly that was all i could taste a very high quality and pleasing dram accessible rich rewarding and balanced if you 39 ve never tried bunnahabhain before then i 39 d recommend starting here  a very pleasant dram lovely nose and once it airs a bit turns decadently sweet and nutty  you experiment with other brands and when you return after a while it 39 s like being reunited with your most faithful and trusted friend  my favourite tried this as a miniture and found that a few drops of water and time in the glass really helps i got something different on the nose every time sweet and salty with a chocolaty orange finish i will be upgrading to a full bottle for sure  toffee and caramel forward not much peat or smoke but a lot of things going on in this dram non chill filtered no color added love that they bottled this at 46 3 great mouthfeel total bargain for this bottle  way too much bite for me nice vanilla and spice i guess my palate is not ready for this one  my oh my i 39 ve enjoyed this bottling for many years but this batch from march 2020 is simply a sherry monster different but magnificently so grab it while you can 163 30 insane  so good i just bought 3 bottles layers of approachable complexity make for a hugely rewarding dram  excellent getting another bottle this weekend  was disappointed with bunnahabhain stiuireadair thought it was a little bland so questioned whether to get this one glad i did a lot more going on with this one almost zero smoke for an islay but sweet very sweet with a hit of sherry and sultana the finish is malty with a nice saltiness all the flavours really seem to grab you by the throat and at 46 3 there 39 s no surprise why  i haven t had a massive selection of whisky or whiskey in my time so i dont really know how to fairly rate this however i think it s very nice as do other who experienced drinkers who have tried it i will be trying more in their range happily have a bottle of this to hand year round as well  didn 39 t expect much in fact i didn 39 t know what to expect but wow this is a must in any collect this is brilliant for price it 39 s such good value i would argue this is better than some of my higher end bottles and that 39 s saying something highly recommended  was surprised by this didn t really expect much but this one delivered and then some honest and fairly complex interesting without being gimmicky at all refreshing islay alternative unpeated no less i will most definitely buy this again great whisky and amazing value  bought as a present by someone who knows my favourite is dalmore 15 year old if you like smooth warming smokeless what is with making whisky that tastes like creosote whisky that leaves a warm glow and a wonderful after taste this hits the spot and some can 39 t wait for a winters night sat by the fire with a glass of this in hand if it lasts that long this will now be on my list of ones to buy drink and enjoy so glad i was gifted this to me a whisky is either good or not and like good wine a matter of personal taste and this beauty is absolutely to my taste i am always on that opinion that 46 3 is too high for a 12 year old i was right about deanston 12 and i was right about this one too the alcohol note is too high otherwise it 39 s a good 12 year old it 39 s a mixture of 75 bourbon and 25 sherry but i would have like to see more depth in the flavours maybe it 39 s just me but it 39 s a 12 year old whisky so you can 39 t expect much depth it 39 s good though nice balance between bourbon and sherry but the alcohol note is too high i tried it neat with and without a splash water let it sit for some time i always felt how strong it is anyways stay safe stay strong lt 3 not a fan of this one tastes peppery to my palate must admit i prefer a talisker  salty sweet non peaty and only a tad smoky with an unbelievable finish in the mouth theres no other like this this whisky made me switch from a speyside to an islay single malt it really does highlight that we should try every new whisky with an open mind without prejudice even if we think we know what w like this s now my favourite dram unexpected  i have been drinking scotch in many iterations for 35 years this year i have opened bottles ranging in price from 30 to 300 for my palate this whisky hits all the marks slowdown and enjoy this marvelous dram  really highly good and smooth my first venture into this distillery and it has not disappointed my first sample was a wake up call it 39 s light fresh and highly drinkable it 39 s complex and light on the nose  i have been drinking whisky for over 50 years and this is a superb malt little drop of water let it stand give it time wonderful i love this bottle it gets better after the first two ounces of it very flavorful  i nearly wrote this whisky off after the first dram and i 39 m so so glad i gave it another go i now completely understand the reviews from people who 39 ve had the same experience my first dram was a challenge it had a fiery sweet peppery bite which was interesting but it was hard to get past that to find much else in terms of flavours after a few days and drams went by the true nature of the whisky opened up those unctuous molasses sherry christmas pudding flavours that i love in a whisk e y for me it 39 s like redbreast 12 39 s scottish counterpart think along those lines in terms of flavours if you 39 ve tried rb12 maybe the whisky just needed some time to breathe maybe it 39 s psychological who knows i 39 ve now been completely converted to bunnahabhain 12 and will be buying this again when the bottle runs dry  its fantastic the sherry notes with malt with a little sweetness and the characteristic islay flavours just finished a dram  fairly disappointing for a 12 year old single malt this in my opinion is more comparable to a cheaper blended whisky in flavour with an unpleasant aggressive alcoholic bite i 39 m sorry i blind bought a bottle based on reviews unfortunately i don 39 t see what the fuss is about  a dreamy little drink nice fruity notes and it 39 s fast becoming a favourite of mine  not too smoky but with a nice finish a little bit of harshness but i added a drop of water and this did the trick to help bring out the softer flavours without losing that nice of touch smokiness  soft with corinth rasins vanilla amp just a smidge of costal sea water water softens it even more amp the vanilla comes to the front smoke peat didnt get much if any the lighter side of islay  i still remember how disappointed i was as a single malt neophyte many years ago trying this for the first time and finding it wasn t the islay smoke bomb i expected however nowadays i find this is the islay malt i find myself turning back to more often than its peated kin it lacks smoke but is just as complex and delicious as the best the island has to offer  i bought a bottle of this on offer on amazon i will not be buying again it lacks flavour and depth and has a sharp rancid bite around the edges of the tongue no detectable peat or smoke there are blended whiskies available for around half the price that are far superior all around  i love a little tot of this delightful malt  my first taste ever from this distillery of this excellent 12 yo i was expecting it to be a bit harsh on the back of the throat like some are but i must admit i was entirely wrong i can taste the slight sweetness amp how clean tasting would like it to be slightly more peated am i being finicky would highly recommend and definitely buy again 5 stars i think it 39 s one of the best for 12yo very good experience  thought i 39 d try something new with this one it wasn 39 t bad i 39 m glad i did try it it 39 s overall well balanced with light coffee with a hint of smoke finished with a herbal and salty flavour which doesn 39 t suit all i thought it was ok definitely not bad and i would happily drink again but i personally would not rush into buying a bottle or if i do buy a bottle it would be one which i 39 d have once in awhile please don 39 t think i 39 m slating the bottle at all i just prefer others that 39 s all  excellent would recommend to anyone who loves a good scotch  with a nose of light coffee seaweed and wet grass on your grandads lawn mower the taste definitely moves towards the coast salty warm apricot with a light a spicey waxy finish  most complete single malt i ve ever experienced would heartedly recommend to scotch whiskey lovers  first try with this distillery and not disappointed wanted something with slight peat finish and happy to say the 12 delivered recommend for those who want to ease their way into more peated labels  gotta lotta love for bunna 12 accessible without being dull or bland a decent dram  it 39 s ok but given what i 39 d heard about this whisky it has come up well short a few points to consider a lot of people are talking it up as a great islay expression there is zero smokiness to it in either palate or nose that i can detect the 46 2 abv does not blend well what i mean by this is it tastes boozy and quite harsh akin to cheaper whiskies it actually reminds me of blended scotch nothing palate nose or finish really stands out it 39 s all very underwhelming mom 39 s tasting notes reveal a lot they 39 re very vague because this whisky is not well defined and the character is not pronounced it particularly memorable i would honestly avoid this whisky there is enough good stuff at this price range this whisky is outshone by plenty of better ones and is comparable to a lot of reasonable blends definitely a miss  this used to be fabulous whisky for the money complex yet eminently drinkable but the latest version tastes like a pale imitation of the rich silken tastefest i d gotten used to i picked up a bottle springtime 2019 and it s very ordinary compared to the last bottle i had it s by no means a bad whisky but it s no longer anything to gush about it tastes like a 163 30 whisky with some harsher notes that you might expect with a young whisky what was once a multi faceted yet smooth dram has become somewhat one dimensional and ordinary verging on boring i hope i just picked up a lame bottle as this was once my go to unpeated everyday malt  went into this one expecting a smokey peaty whisky but was taken on a different journey not expected for an isley i was reward with fruit notes with a hint of smoke and an unexpected new favorite whisky  i love this bunnahabhain 12 years a perfect dram on the palate and on the nose an islay as bunnahabhain can give very very very good  nothing of islay and certainly nothing of a 12 year old preadolescent mebbe not happy but price in the afterthought not troubling  thanks to many of you for your reviews of this whisky i ordered a bottle and tried last night and it 39 s the best i 39 ve drank yet just a very enjoyable dram definitely get the caramel in the taste along with some sherry and vanilla the nose is very pleasant and really opens up with a little water the finish is long with a touch of smoke mixed with dark fruits a very enjoyable hour and a half spent with bunnahabain a book wife and my dog last night  i love this whisky sweet nutty just a hint of smoke far more interesting to me than some other islay offerings always buy a bottle when on offer  absolutely love this single malt the smell when i opened the bottle was beautifully sweet and complex can barely notice any peat smoke at all and i am not a big peaty whisky drinker so that 39 s saying something definitely has the most depth of flavour and character of all the 12 year old or younger whiskeys ive tried great product at a great price paid 163 40 and will for sure be exploring more from bunnahabhain maybe the travel retail exclusives and buying this 12 year old again 5 stars what a shame that the smoothness richness and flavours have seemingly been abandoned for an acidic thin sharp t c p throat stringent stripper bottle bought june 2019 used to be so lovely  not a patch compared to old version don 39 t understand how this won gold in 2014 this is one of the finest scotch whiskies i 39 ve tried it 39 s not heavily peated and it 39 s hard to believe it 39 s an islay but a dense well rounded flavour comes to the fore with a lovely oaky aftertaste this is as good as scotch gets for those who shy away from inky iodine such as most islays present definitely nothing like it at 64 worth every penny  this was the scotch that made me get it prior to this i had tried dewars white label glenlivet and glenfiddich entry level offerings i decided to get a bottle of this as my final attempt to enjoy scotch as soon as i tasted it it was like a whole new awareness and understanding came over me now i enjoy other heavily peated islays but i can also pick out and appreciate the more subtle flavors of speyside and highland single malts and everyday blended scotches this scotch will always be one of my favorites because without it i would have given up on scotch entirely  natural color higher abv ncf and an age statement all things a scotch should have and at a wonderful price the taste is perfectly balanced not too sweet but you definitely know the sherry is there nice coastal salinity small amount of smoke rich and smooth excellent for a 12 year  great flavours in this whisky almost reminded me a bit of glenfarclas 15 with its fruity sherry taste and quite complex deep and rich for a 12 year old a must try in my opinion 128513  almost doesn 39 t even taste like scotch i like the potency at 45 and change rough around the edges would probably be excellent as a 15 or 18 yr decent value a lot of dry sherry can taste vanilla and wood not overly fruity if you are more of a highland irish or bourbon fan add a half a star i prefer lagavulin and talisker it was almost as smooth as drinking tea i mean that as a compliment for how easy it went down yet it had some wonderful notes a complete and pleasant surprise in relation to other islay scotches i ve sampled  a bourbon drinker that loves this stuff because ummm it tastes rather like bourbon  having my first dram excellent lingers  lovely jubbly i can 39 t see this staying at this price point for much longer 12 year old non chill filtered and natural colour at circa 40 quid there are plenty of other companies producing nas junk for more money a hidden gem  i have never been a fan of islay but this one is outstanding  all the richness of the best sherried whisky but with subtle nuances that make it unique traces of smoke but more the sweet highland park variety than the typical islay the coastal salty tang is also very slight balanced and much more refined than that of say ol pulteney 12 this is the cream that rises to the top the cherry and vanilla are very evident the very subtle sweet smoke builds up slightly on the palate as you enjoy glass after glass of this criminally underrated 12 year old malt outstanding  the best whisky ive tasted in years i am a new and begginer whisky drinker usually more in peaty salty ones adberg lagavulin laphroaig i am in a quot discovering quot phase ans i like to try different stuff and therfore bought this one very sherry oh my god i was really surprised i thought it would be more balance and subtile but the first minute all i could smell and tast was sherry very different actually totally different from my other islay i need to get use to it knowing this it is good no doubt  surprised and satisfied corundum this single malt to be delicious i just purchased a small quot sample quot bottle at my local retailer and i have to say i loved it i like my whisky cold and then on ice probably not the way you 39 re supposed to drink this caliber of whisky but that 39 s how i like it i 39 m definitely an amateur at different whiskys whiskeys having only tried maybe a dozen or more makers but i 39 ve always wanted to try some true scotch whisky i was very happy with the matching of the various flavors and quite frankly the sherry flavor didn 39 t really stand out like i thought it might not a big fan of sherry sorry but the overall taste and smell was quite pleasing very glad i picked this one up i may have ask for a full size bottle for christmas  this whisky epitomises why islay is the finest whisky region on the planet compared to most islay 39 s it 39 s relatively smoke free but there is enough of a hint there to keep you interested along with a some nice spicy tones but very little burn just lovely makes you just want to come back for more  this didn 39 t blow me away from reading the reviews i was hoping to find a lightly peated complex sherrybomb i was eluded this whisky has quite a light body and the sherry maturation remembered me of glenfarclas 16 which to me is a far cry from a true sherrybomb like glendonach or glen garioch 15 the subtle peat shining through after the initial sherry sweetness does add some complexity though and i found the finish to be way more satisfying and longer than gf 16 although not too complex overall it 39 s a nice and interesting whisky just don 39 t expect a sherrybomb you 39 ll be left dissapointed  not a huge fan of islay malts but this boy is fairly light with the peatiness overall a tasty wee dram it smells like the sea but somehow dry at the same time nice smoky aftertaste i will definitely experiment further with bunna islay jobs 128077  i picked this up on ralfy 39 s recommendation as quot the lighter side of islay quot not that i was afraid of peat i love peat i really just want to taste every islay expression anyway i know some people detect peat in this but not me i can feel peat even in cheap blends where it is just barely present to make them taste like an ashtray in lighter malts glenkinchie 12 lovely i can 39 t feel any peat in this bunny no big deal i also love unpeated malts especially sherried this malt is substantial full bodied and delicious practice adding water you don 39 t want too much but it does benefit from some and give it plenty of time to breathe and open up it tastes much older than 12 years it may not be quot exactly quot like aberlour or sherried macallan but it 39 s easily on par and in similar part of the swatch  lovely especially at this price level on offer at waitrose for 163 30 so somewhat overpriced here quite woody bit of sherrry not a lot of peat as you 39 d expect for the other islay ones  great value the first half of the bottle was truly fantastic unfortunately it seems quality drops extra fast with bunna 12 as the second half i finnished the bottle in six mounts time was pretty ordinary  i keep coming back to this whisky after trying many many others it is absolutely fabulous and fantastic value for money rich toffee chocolate honey a little spice some pepper but no unpleasant burn this is the one that wil always be in my collection  my first venture into islay smooth sweet dried friut bomb at first but then a tiny puff of smoke with a lovely long dry finish this isn t going to last very long  this is such am wonderful coastal malt with a robust complex flavour and great long finish but why are mom charging so much for this it is only 163 32 at my local supermarket  not for the peat heads and maybe not for beginners but for me one of the best 12 years old i have ever had a bit of everything complex and well rounded  first impression is a smooth sherried sweetness quite complex as fruit appears and despite not as peaty as its southern islay cousins you can still close your eyes and taste the rocky salty shoreline  i should add to previous review i 39 ve been spending the evening doing some tasting comparisons across several islay expressions and i 39 ve finally got to compare this to oogie whilst it 39 s not as big there are lots of similarities maybe the bunnahabain is more gently peated of course and the initial hit on the palate is gentler but the sweet sherry hit is also adding to the serenity i 39 d almost go ad far to say that the bunnahabain is a softer mire gentle version of oogie all i know is that the more i drink it the more i like it  spotted this lounging next to the a 39 bunadh that i 39 d set out to buy quick look at mom reviews and figured worth a try for 163 30 holy mackerel it 39 s good it 39 s nothing like my go to islay collection of ardbegs and laphroaigs but it 39 s so well balanced and such complexity the 46 abv helps to avoid overpowering the palate so those fruit flavours shine through with a mild peat background going on i really enjoyed some bowmore 15 samples recently and nearly bought some but i much prefer this at this price it 39 s fantastic value forget buying a supermarket superstar for the extra tenner this blows their socks off  nose creamy vanilla fudge soft camomile some floral notes green fruits apple subtle pear very faint smoke pallet toasted walnuts some vanilla sweetness earl grey tea note some sour grape red rounded yet spicy sherry finish brine with some unground black pepper  for me the best 12yr aged malt on the market the best 163 40 you can spend if that 39 s your budget  what a surprise the deep dark sherry notes reminded me of the glendronach 18 the 18 so flavor much value it 39 s been a while since i 39 ve been wow 39 ed by a dram but this one did the trick a must buy  fantastic complex whisky that compares with the very best distilled christmas pudding and panatone in a glass excellent and very easy to drink  not your usual islay style but an excellently rewarding and balanced malt that i enjoy every time i taste it  now i like smoky peaty whiskies as much as the next guy as long as that guy likes smoky peaty whiskies but bunnahabhain 12 is a different beast it 39 s not peated and it 39 s not smoky but boy is it complex and interesting it seems a little expensive but it 39 s not dollar for dollar or euro or yen it 39 s a bargain you can 39 t guzzle it on a friday night that 39 s what wild turkey and johnnie walker are for but you can pour a nice dram once or twice a week to soften the edges of a rough day non chill filtered and uncolored buy it drink it enough said  not what i expected from aa islay whisky but a nice change from the bombastic smokey nd peaty msamplings common to this part of scotland this dram is loaded with fresh fruit with an almond note salty sweet in the back carmel candy in the front with a spice and brine lingering throughout delicious  i 39 ve tried almost every scotch this has the best flavor at the best price point  what a great whisky see past the price and once it 39 s seen and smelt in the glass you know this is a quality dram that belies it 39 s age no added colouring makes the rich golden caramel colour even more impressive and higher than normal abv offsets the sweetness and balances perfectly on the tongue it is fruity and satisfying feeling much older than it actually is suffice to say one of my favourites find the finishing generally short especially comparing to other islay malt however the sherried nose coupled with sweet and succulent honey coating on palate leaves a tasty salty licorice aftertaste a new favourite as an after dinner dram recommend to pour it over the chinese dessert herbal jelly  really enjoyed my bottle lovely sherry figgy notes very figgy actually gingerish a little salty and the peat levels were more than expected but definitely not a peat bomb like you may expect from islay licorice fennel and some dry salty spices on the finish it was a tad 39 nippy 39 when first opened but settled beautifully after a month or so  smooth balanced subtle with wonderful undertones from sherry casks in fact it 39 s so smooth i almost wish it was a tad more peaty my initiation to bunnahabhain came via the whisky shop at tomintoul where i was seduced with a single cask bottling from 2003 for me the only competition comes from tobermory 39 s ledaig although i treasure my store of peated glendronach for now bunnahabhain reigns supreme  this is a wonderful whisky rich sherry oak salty notes and light hints of cherry i also find that there is a very unique smell to this malt salty sweet rocky like granite almost it 39 s a great malt for the price  legs are fast lack of viscosity suggest a oloroso rather than px cask nose very sweet dried fruits and some tropical fruits from the longer fermentation with lactobacilli beginning to dominate the ethyl acetates acetate esters and ethyl esters suggesting a wooden washback light smokiness from gentle peating slight rubber from feints slightly sulphur possibly from candle in cask palate sweet salty dried fruits and tropical fruits peach mango wood spices detectable but not strongfinish medium sweet mixed fruit sherried at end  the taste i found was balanced gives the slight undertone which will have you reaching for more  i 39 ve tried plenty of single malt scotch whiskies many substantially more pricey than this i 39 m struggling to think of any that i 39 d enjoyed more or were better value if you need a huge peat hit then this ain 39 t for you however if you want a great tasting sophisticated spirit look no further for me this is a treasure of islay it 39 s beautifully balanced with just a subtle trace of smoke a magnificent sweet backbone amp a lingering finish i rate the islay scotches as king amp this is a worthy prince of the realm  terribly disappointed looked forward to tasting a real islay malt but this was not a patch on lagavulin it had a weird taste and was sweet yet acrid i 39 ll keep it for taking spots of the carpet rather liked this and have gotten several bottles a good reception from friends to it  a wee bit of heaven on earth  excellent east or south european fruit or grain double distilled moonshine would taste adequately better considering ridiculously huge difference in price  i hate peat and i hate it in whisky but this one has just the right amount to love it and enjoy with friends highly recommended for somebody who loves glengoyne and speyside whiskies just like i do  i 39 m with you mr frank 2 reviews below if they have to put the price up to maintain a proper age statement entry level malt of this standard then so be it if you 39 re exploring peated whiskies it 39 s a stone cold must  loved this malt heaven tried it for the first time 20 years ago and although the price keeps going up from year to year this one does it for me  normally i would always drink a sherried malt as being an aussie i think we have a sweeter tooth than those from the quot old world quot firstly it was pigs nose yuk then it was lagavulin 16 which is commendable and then bunnahabhain 12 certainly a very smooth well made spirit and better than tobermory 15 97 points surprisingly delightful and provocative i give it 4 out of 5 stars as for the nose off in the distance i get hints of maple syrup pancakes if you bury your nose into the dram your olfactory glands are assaulted with the scent isopropyl alcohol opening up your nostrils palate it has a certain boldness and complexity to it at first sip it 39 s excitingly warm like a kiss from a new love but the memory of it is lost soon after leaving you wanting for more now as a novice connoisseur oxymoronic like quot jumbo shrimp quot maybe i 39 m not the best one to evaluate the dram because my taste buds are not that distinguishing e g i can appreciate a good hotdog as well as an average hamburger as a matter of fact i was eating a slice of pizza along with a side glass of moscato while sipping on my bunnahabhain aperitif at home as if i was at some resort taking in the astonishing simplicities of life quot well at the end of the day isn 39 t that truly what it 39 s all about friend quot finish it does have a lingering effect on the throat sherry like and pleasantly warm but not overwhelming so history about me i 39 m a novice went to a scotch tasting for the first time last summer 2015 in wash d c the varieties offered were aberlour oban balvenie and yamazki 12 yr single malt sm the pours were in plastic containers cups the overhead ceiling fans were on blowing down onto the crowd and the drinks which in my opinion oxidized the scotches just setting out at the different tasting stations but hands down for me was the yamazki 12 yr sm my recent m of m purchases nikka w from the barrell japanese paul john peated select cask indian yamazaki reserve japanese and nikka all malt japanese since then i 39 ve acquired a couple of bottles of bunnahabhain 12 here in the us for 49 00 each and a bottle of quot the dalmore aged 12 yr highland single malt scotch whiskey for about 25 00 rating of the four scotches i purchased from mom nikka fr the barrell was number one for me however my number two was paul john it 39 s simply to die for but don 39 t do it live on and enjoy the whiskey the quot nose quot by far for me as a novice stands alone when you first whiff the aroma your olfactory glands and brain reverberate saying quot whoah what is that quot oak chemical what the aroma captivates and assaults your nose like a muhammed ali right hook coming at you from out of nowhere prompting you to say quot where 39 d the hell did that come from quot but i do agree with the chaps at m of m mom the nose is very earthy not sure about the salt though as for the palate mom is quot spot on quot bbq smoke quot all the way relative to the finish there is something about the flavor quite can 39 t put my finger on it that lingers on your tongue long after you 39 ve finished the dram shot snifter or whatever your choice of drinking glass is just do me a favor quot no plastic cups quot please use an acceptable drinking glass by the way the paul john peated select cask is escalating in price real fast so if you like peated whiskeys i 39 d advise you to jump on this one asap before the price skyrockets bon appetite  what a great whisky bought this in germany because it was 10 euro 39 s cheaper than in holland as a fan of islay whisky i had great aspectations for this one i knew before i bought this one that it is unpeated islay whisky and that it might be a disappointment but it wasn 39 t at all it is superbe stuff for me i still love peated whisky but when i am in the mood for a softer more delicate well balanced whisky this is my dram the different tastes come in so gentle even when i swallow there is nothing hostile about this whisky not that i can 39 t enjoy a brute force heavely peated troat burning islay whisky anymore but now i have a choice between two very different styles without 39 getting of 39 islay thanks for that bunnahabhain  for my dime this is a wonderful dram very nice lingering flavors of sherry smoke peat and salt no color added no chill filtration yes  this is different than other islays i 39 ve had so far not to strongly peated which can be good at times amp you 39 d never guess it had a higher alcohol content than 40 because it was so light with a dry finish amp no burn at all the main thing that stood out to me though was the sweet fruity nose amp taste wasn 39 t sure i liked it at 1st but by the 3rd sip i knew i had to have a second dram just to test it of course i can see that this wouldn 39 t be for everyone but i 39 ll keep a bottle around for when i want something different  this was my go to for many years but this batch for 2016 is not up to par something is off doesn 39 t have the depth it used to still has the nose but the palate creaminess is gone and the finish is short tired casks  bought this one and also the m 243 ine version both taste terrible and pored half the glas down the drain i couldn 39 t even finish it verry weird taste and its not for me many people like it but not me i stay with highland park ardbeg and laga in the future  have they changed this whisky as i 39 ve bought 2 bottles of this over the last few months and both bottles were not like they used to be they tasted and smelt heavily of bourbon bunnahabhain 12 is one of my favourites and this is not the bunnahabhain i love at first this tastes and drinks like a gently sherry 39 d speysider there 39 s a hint of peat in the finish some salinity right at the start of the development followed mostly by the gentle but noticeable sherry influence as you let it linger other interesting notes hinting more to its islay origins start to surface iodine subtle medicinal tang just at the edges for a 12 year old it 39 s remarkably developed with a great underlying malt matured in some excellent wood tl dr buy this it really is excellent  nose sweet cereal faint toasted grainpalate light bready sweetness with figs and nuts a touch of salinity touch of toasted grain again on last chew finish oaky slight sherry and figs my go to all around dram it fits every almost every occasion  far too sweet for me syrupy soooo wanted to like this opened the bottle at christmas and wasn 39 t impressed then my bottle of benromach walks all over it decided to try again tonight but no it 39 s just as bad definately one of my poorer choices and won 39 t be buying another bottle sorry  this was recently recommend to me by retailer in the us selling for 55 a great bargain compared to other single malts and a very unique flavor i love it  very nice will not dissapoint you  really lovely drop very well balanced with a great smooth slightly sweet finish very subtle peat which is great as i find heavily peated a bit much sometimes  just got this as a holiday present and it is everything they say it is  this is definitely not your typical peat fest isla whiskey which i enjoy but i do get a bit overwhelmed by sometimes the review below with tasting notes is bang on i especially like the interesting metallic note on the nose which i feel becomes slightly more pronounced when adding water fabulous stuff  i started drinking whisky 10 years now never like it before because i had never taste single barel whiskies now bunnahabain is my favorite sweet and earthy smooth and long finish i think is the best whiskey l ever taste before but i am not an expert difficult to find in my country my second choice is aberlour i like lagavulin and caolila but just one or two zips i also like blanton 39 s  i decided to try bunna 12 again after a long hiatus i first game gave this dram a bad review but i gave it another shot i have grown to appreciate it it has a very distinct oily sherry tone that makes this one of the smoothest 12 years you will have if you like bourbon and sherry then this is your scotch  this bottle is good bottle tasting good thanks not a long finish i wouldn 39 t have guessed that peat is in there a higher ppm would have scewed this in the right diretion in my opinion and personal preference ofc that being said it is a nice expression from bunnahabhain worth trying but nothing special  i find this to be one of best 12yr on the market right now i 39 m having a glass as i write this the nose is powerful a lot of alcohol up front followed by a mild sweetness diluted honey palate it glides across the mouth like high thread count cotton sheets salty smoky a bit of dried fruit finish long spice a deep complexity that seems to be constant flux rich and earthy  very similar to jura 16 which i also like sherry sweet to a degree i enjoy i 39 ll buy another bunnahabhain if i can find it  ☆☆☆☆☆ similar to the chaps at m o m cheers guys my bar is temperature controlled and uv protected i used a stemmed and stemless glencairn along with a port glass for this review after three 750ml bottles were eventually finished i am mindful of humidity levels upright storage proper for whiskey oxidization rate of consumption in glass breathing temperature and clean tasting environments i use a handwarming technique i employ various palatting techniques and nosing positions i never use scented or bar soap to wash my hands i hand wash my glasses to avoid dishwasher residue double rinse with the whiskey itself that i 39 m going to pour unless water is desired really good water not all bottled water is acceptable to me i am careful to remove the collar foil and avoid finger contact with the cork when opening and closing i 39 m mindful of what i eat and when i ate it before and after enjoying a whiskey and i experiment with food pairings nose p x sherry imparts butterscotch toffee meaty nutty coastal air hazelnuts broken in leather seaweed toasted cereals heather bunnahabhain 39 s signature quot metalic quot aroma which on closer examination breaks down into a combination of heather florals and fruits undertones of cornedbeef stewed cabbage figs dates bartlett pears cedar oak raw walnuts hibiscus plant chamomile tea iodine campfire smoke molasses cardamom and an earthiness i can only describe as powdered cinnamon that 39 s lost its potency from being in the spice cupboard for years nose with water doesn 39 t transform in any unusual way like some whiskies can nothing is hidden really but the fresh fruits come out a bit clearer butterscotch is more dominant mouth feel overall is somewhat drying resinous palate entry iodized table salt sweet maritime freshness fresh fruits cereals heather vibrant juicy sweet and salty palate middle hazelnuts big time heather becomes stronger salt is still there but fades shortly into the middle dark spices dried fruits toasted malt citrus orange tangerine are the major notes here palate finish loooong salt returns and lingers with butterscotch and hazelnuts heather continues on and i get a whisp of campfire smoke and a touch of iodine oak is strong but not too strong just right palate aftertaste after the fireworks finish salted roasted hazelnuts resinous sticky mouth feel sherry imparts linger a long time and make themselves at home overall not for diehard peat heads looking for the laphroaig of years past i would recommend this to anyone without such expectations it 39 s an extraordinary sherried islay that is so well balanced i can 39 t help but think that such perfection was made on accident but with good intentions of course this is certainly one of the best 12s i 39 ve had and a very loveable whiskey one of only a few i can honestly say is not only flawless but way ahead of its class i 39 ve bought 5 bottles of this amazing single malt so far at 70 a piece i 39 m interested in more of this and g amp m 39 s mortlach 15 as soon as i can afford it and find it if oregon would allow deliveries i 39 d be a very good customer of m o m great prices and rep  for a 12 year old and i 39 m not saying whiskies that aren 39 t 21 29 years old are inferior by default i simply mean compared to others in the 12 year age class this simply doesn 39 t get any better only different i 39 m an experienced and well read whiskey enthusiast and know that 1st hand experience is far more valuable than reading tasting notes so go buy one i use 3 palatting techniques critical to experiment with i pay attention to what foods i eat might subtly affect a particular whiskey i sip even an hour or more after a meal i pioneer food pairings as well i 39 m no noobie and i say that this is perfectly balanced perfection in a bottle about palatting techniques briefly find a very very dry whiskey and experiment with different palatting techniques until you can make it taste sweet because whatever flavors might be revealed in doing so will only be enjoyed if you do so experiment with various ways you sip and swallow never gulp even a small sip swallow it in 2 3 miniature intervals while palatting yes that was the brief explanation have fun learning the rest this is the best era bunnahabhain has seen in a decade i appreciate the fine attention to detail from this distillery lately it 39 s never been better in my experience looong finish for a 12 too highly recommend even to those weary of islays i just finished my third bottle with two more unopened  i don 39 t know what you regularly drink but this is about as natural and authentic as it gets unchill filtered and natural colour and an age statement as well it might not rock yor socks but artificial it most definitely is not  before i get slammed i think this is a safe scotch it is well balanced and smooth but just doesn 39 t have that wow factor when you try it it is good but there are better entry level drams available good but not great  went to my local liquor store to get highland park 12 year but they were out so ended up getting bunnahabhain 12 year and i have to say this is a wonderful dram i saw islay on the bottle and thought this was going to be very peaty but was pleasantly surprised tastes slightly smoky but not peaty more of a charred wood smoke with a lot of herbal bitterness and a hint of seaweed the sherry is there but not so much that it takes away from the other flavors all in allost well rounded scotch i think i 39 ve had tastes like everything i love about scotch in one bottle this will have a permanent spot in my whisky cabinet not as peaty as most other islays at first i was a little disappointed with the immediate taste lacking that classic taste of the sea but the bunna 12 has a great mouth feel with a smokiness that lingers with tastes of vanilla and honey almonds it has a long finish and when you add some water it really opens up some more of that peat sea salt taste very affordable and is a great islay for any newbies to this type of scotch  i 39 m the first to say reviews should never ever be scrutinized but anyone reading this needs to know that this is basically a non peated whisky very much the exception to the islay quot rule quot in fact bunnahabhain brings in fresh spring water from the source to avoid any that may have run thru a bog and uses low phenolic malted barley you obviously like your islay peat which is wonderful i love them too but saying bunnahabhain tasted sherried is well very correct sherry casks are employed at this distillery did you not see the tasting notes from the fine chaps at master of malt having any dram let you down is never good while you may be disappointed i don 39 t think it was the whisky 39 s fault hopefully you can find it a good home  i didn 39 t like this scotch at all at first because of the sherry flavor but i added a little water and tried it again water is key in bringing out the great flavors of this scotch it has a very short finish but is extremely smooth there really isn 39 t any smoke peat flavor here bunnahabhain 12 has it 39 s own flavor  after reading all the reviews i was excited to add this to my 30 bottle collection of mostly islay scotches i was extremely disappointing since this tasted just like a sherried bourbon i couldn 39 t even get down one glass because of the awful flavor i will stick with my laphroaig lagavullin smokehead ledaig ardbeg and bowmore in my normal rotation  without a doubt you will not find a more complex 12yo whisky on the market for this price money well spent you won 39 t be disappointed p s don 39 t tell anyone else about this i don 39 t want them getting in on my supply  this has become my go to dram when i am not looking for something specific peat bomb sherry bomb etc it is extremely well rounded you get a bit of everything and it works very well together i hadn 39 t tried it prior to the improvements 46 3 no coloring non chill filtered but from what i hear those of you who weren 39 t impressed before should really give this one another taste great  this is my go to whisky and i 39 m not ashamed to say it no color and un chillfiltered yes please this has the maturity and complexity of a much older malt a perfect balance of saltiness and sweet and coastal characteristics that will take you right to the water 39 s edge where the bunnahabhain distillery sits an amazing taste experience for the price guaranteed you 39 ll feel the salt air hear the gulls and smell the damp green hills when you escape in this beautiful dram it 39 s worth every penny still on the fence order a sample from the chaps at master of malt  i rarely find fault with a scotch not sure this one falls into that category it tastes industrial false and even tacky i taste molasses and not enough bite i regret purchasing a bottle a first for this scotch lover  i had my first taste of this last night and its my 5th islay and i liked it the best of them all so far the laphroaig 10 and 18 are kind of single trick ponies the coal ila 12 was great the ardbeg corryvreckan is great as was the kilchoman but i think the bunnahabhain 12 is my favorite islay now very little smoke and not a lot of typical over the top islay flavor but very well rounded overall  one of the most tasteful of the 12 year old single malts sweet caramel hint of smoke oak well matured and rich yummy  love this whisky can 39 t say enough good about it the color is a gorgeous caramel the nose is a pure delight maple orange rosebuds cinnamon and nutmeg the taste a pure delight not as much peat as i like in an islay but just a pleasure to drink similar to highland park 12 or glenfiddich 18 which are two of my favorites if i had a choice between the three oh my might be this bunnahabhain  this is the first un chillfiltered whisky that i tried the taste explosion blew me away the stuff is awesome with a slight bit of peat in the background it really stands out for me very well balanced one of a kind and really worth a try  oops forgot to add star rating 5 of course  interesting to read the varied reviews of bunna 12yo i think much is down to one 39 s experience and expectations i wouldn 39 t say that it 39 s one for malt whisky beginners nor for someone trying an islay malt for the first time complex unusual rewarding even 39 burnt rubber 39 it 39 s all of those i love it i couldn 39 t say which is my favourite islay malt but bunna 12yo is up there with ardbeg caol ila and lagavulin and much cheaper than any of those  this whisky is good start to discover the peat taste it has only 1 2 ppm phenol you will not be shocked as i was for the first time tasted lagavulin 16 about 35 40 ppm smooth and balanced drink i recommend  not much to find on the nose just some salted caramel and sea air however the surprisingly smooth every so sweet and smoky palate lends itself to a long buttery finish with subtle complexities overall a very enjoyable dram with light peat and great finish not overly complex but far from being one noted a superb whisky for the price  what a delightful surprise my wife and i visited bunnahabhain whilst staying in islag at the laphroaig view guest house since arriving back in south australia i have purchased two 12 year old bunnahabhain whisky bottles and i have introduced several people to this most excellent whisky smooth lovely nose lingering mellow aftertaste thank you  by far my favourite single malt not to peaty and long lasting smooth finish can 39 t say much more other than it is truly a sublime whisky sp  yum  i don 39 t really like peat but i love this just a hint and well balanced with a touch of sweetness and spice  much better than many flat 12 year old speysides and excellent value i keep coming back to bunna 12 it just does it for me lovely long finish and bottled at 46 it has all the islay magic without much peat  very tasty you have to have some scotch experience to like this awesome in a word peat salt spice with a cocoa buttery textured finish  just plain delicious what more can be said can 39 t imagine a better whisky for the price and even for double the price i am a highland park 12 lover as well as several islays and this is right up there with the best of the best glad i discovered it  stunning quality and complexity at this age and price an islay malt which deserves much more attention add a little water and you ll be in malt heaven  i am now half way through my second bottle of this amazing whisky there is bags of flavour and for me it has just the right amount of peaty smoke i love its sweet salty fruit freshness and the darker complex sherry undertones one of those rare drams that you can t be without and great value bottled at over 46  sweet and hint of liqourice root warm and comforting while i agree with many that bunnahabhain 12 seems to have just a touch of peat which melds perfectly with this sherry bomb of a whisky according to the distillery it is actually unpeated i struggle to believe it because it means all that smoky flavor in it comes purely from the wood  this dram offers good value for it s money i love the amber color to start with the body is light and rolls cleanly through your glass on the nose it s quite gentle with both hints of seaside and meadowy landscapes the palate reveals a smooth herbal sensation ultimately resulting in a medium long finish characterized by a trace of pepper and more herbs definitely enjoyable whisky which is nicely accesable and friendly on the tongue   163 28 odd on offer at waitrose really glad i picked it up lovely   foot of the river n anybody tell me what bunnahabhain means  this has been a real discovery i picked up a bottle while visiting islay and have really enjoyed it rich complex flavours with a beautiful dark chocolate finish i highly recommend it  i don t know anyone who doesn t enjoy this we have had many bottles and most expressions including a lovely 14 year old from chieftain s choice really enjoying the 25 year old at present would like the old style bottle back with the older fisherman on the front as i liked it  i was given a bottle as a gift and really enjoyed it a touch of peat but considerably less than most islay malts a lovely expression  bought this on the highest recommendation of ralfy com first time he s lead me astry so i assume that the fault lies with inconsistency at bunnahabhain this malt simply tastes rancid like a cross between burnt rubber and rotting meat it s completely undrinkable and i don t even think i could blend the off flavors away  a beautiful dram i picked this up along with the sister brand deanston 12 when they were offered at a 163 10 discount at my local supermarket they are both bottled unchillfiltered at over 46 and represent great value the bunna has more flavour and a fair degree of peat influence without it taking control my only disappointment is a distinctly musty nose but it is less obvious on the palate all in all a cracker of a single malt i shall be ordering more at full price  bunnahabhain 12 and highland park 12 always stay in my cabinets  if you like lightly peated lightly sweet this is a good drink i love the extra alcohol burn but it disguises some flavor worth trying but a bit pricey life is a a bowl of cornflakes isn t it bunnahabhain own up to 1 million casks all of which are on their 3rd or 4th use the bunna 12 was the bottle which started my obsession addiction to whisky many moons ago sadly a visit to the distillery this year confirmed the crisis they are in tired casks maximum production reached a lack of cask storage and infrastructure expenditure neglect have culminated in the drop in quality of this revered dram i hope the new owners distell will create the turnaround until then forget the 12 enjoy the 18 and cross fingers all will be well for the future  i m new to whisky but i ve had enough experience to know great whisky exists and this isn t a great maybe older versions would be better to mellow out the alcohol sting idk it s better with water but not something i d recommend or buy again  reminded me of a mild brandy too much sherry i was disappointed because i paid 50 hoping to get some peat and smokey flavour but got none   lots going on and a completely different animal with just a splash of water high up there on the flavour scale for the money and very refined i dont give many a 10 a deep amber colour for a 12 year old with a good medium body leads to a rather disappointing and offensive nose orange peel and spices are evident along with slight banana notes the high alcohol content is very prominent in the nose to taste initially it is smooth however as soon as the whisky is allowed to settle on the palate the bite is overwhelming adding water eases the bite and relaxes the palate to succumb to the almost non existent finish in summary an islay whisky that has none of the stereotypical characteristics of the well loved quot islay s quot characterless and alcoholic  a seaside breeze of salty peat followed by gentle smooth vanilla and a beautiful oily brininess of a mouth feel thanks to the no chill filtration still vibrant and clean with note of citrus coming through and a slight nuttiness on the finish only a drop of water needed if any and after 10 15 minutes a caramel smell develops beautiful a great whisky in my book the reviewer above has obviously lost all sense of smell and taste especially if he she can not smell that peat  на вкус и запах как солодовая брага да есть мягкость и херес угадывается торфа и дыма нет вообще очень своеобразный и противный солод самый худший что я пил отзывы о нём сильно преувеличены на любителя translation using google translate the taste and smell like malt brewed beer yes there is a softness and sherry guessed peat and smoke not at all very peculiar and nasty malt the worst that i ve been drinking feedback was greatly exaggerated an amateur  got it as a present so it had a head start but have to say smooth as silk a definite winner  tastes like christmas  i will not be without this one it is outstanding in its class price the more i have drunk it the better i have liked it i would have no hesitation in recomending it to you johnny norfolk setting my easter decided to have some and cork broke in the bottle first cork that ever broke off in a whisky bottle for me other than a stopper in there now should i make a fuss and take back to the store anyone else have this problem i have hardly had more than 4 5 tots interested in your opinion mike ssouth africa we had a blind tasting of six different islays there were nine of us sampling all the drams and it was unanimous the 12yo bunnahabhain was the worst of the six burnt rubber was actually written on two separate note cards  beautiful details in the nose caramels and apricots a touch of water opens it up and brings more smiles no artificial coloring and not chill filtered too a great great sip the bottle empties quickly  creamy and smooth an excellent value i much prefer the bunnahabhain 25 10 out of 10 but for far less money you can get this and pretend it s the 25  i ve a wee taste by the fire every evening it is the best part of my day  certainly a game of too halves neat it is strong and sherried add a dash more like a drip and it becomes a smooth fruity xmas pudding of a malt with a hint of vanilla hanging round the edges exceptional and a bottle you want to keep exploring further to unearth its hidden flavours  one of the best single malts i have ever tasted the bottle runs out far too quick though  jim murray doesn t like it but i think it s great plenty of punch and nice caramels no peat but still an islay great  this is the best malt i have ever drunk every sip from this brings back good old memories its aroma reminds me of wild peaches wet smoke cinnamon and the salty sea air without a doubt the king of malts i need a drink now  sherried black currant lightly seaweed nutty smooth spices a very different than older presentation but not necessarily better i have to mention that when i have less than 1 5 bottle left it suddenly started to taste very bitter and sulfuric maybe oxygen influence i hope that was just a dud because otherwise this is a great stuff  beautiful chust  stars with sherry touch pronounced peat that does not overwhelm the spicy ftuity bodeaux note but still makes very clear it s islay scotch of the finest with sherry touch pronounced peat that does not overwhelm the spicy ftuity bodeaux note but still makes very clear it s islay scotch of the finest definately the king of malt is he sitting on shergar  if you look closely you can see that without any doubt the character on the bottle is lord lucan in disguise surely the police can get him at last 
2571.0, wonderful fruit and a little honey oaky malty scotch i love scotch and i truly believe this is yet another masterpiece from scotland it is a cornerstone of any decent home scotch bar peppery malt deliciousness  well rounded and easy drinking primary flavour for me is subtle heather and honey in its own way i quite like it yet it 39 s also kinda forgettable if it was 2 3 the price i 39 d buy it now and again but for that money i can buy longrow glen scotia etc which for my money offer so much more flavour it 39 s a toasty peppery and briny experience if that 39 s your thing it 39 s great if it 39 s not it 39 s rough  received this as a christmas gift and wasn 39 t expecting much having seen wome reviews on youtube it 39 s decent but could be a lot better at a higher percentage and without added colour definitely overpriced oban 14 on the nose honey fruity sweetness apple pears vanilla slight smoke peat palate fruity honey spice figs dry malty ish light peat some briny notes citrus  priced slightly above mid range whiskies the oban 14 led me to believe that it would be much more an experience than it turned out to be it has a charming nose but missed having any character to follow that charm while not noteworthy for being offensive in its taste it simply hasn 39 t the character to support the price for the same money one could have a bottle of the sublime glenmorangie quinta ruban this is more at the level of low to mid range scotch like a highland park 12  middle of the road i d go so far as to say nondescript not enough smoke not enough citrus not enough fruit and these characteristics combine to the extent that it appears smooth but in the same way that a lounge lizard is smooth ie no depth or character it seems to be trying to be islay and speyside and fails miserably at both but then i m a peat man and probably have the taste of a mad dog  tuath glass showing light tawny the nose shows sweet floral and lightly briny with hints of honey or syrup the palate is moderately sweet with same floral and honey notes on the palate with a light smokiness on the finish moderate alcohol burn after 2 drops of water a creaminess develops on the palate with the sweetness further revealing itself  excellent drink one of favourites  i was shocked at how smooth this whisky is truly impressive  although there are sweet notes on the palate for me the finish is smooth and smokey i generally go for single malts on the sweeter side however this does not disappoint  just the right smokiness and strength  nose subtle spice oak hint of chalk palate rich oaked honey there 39 s a somewhat unique deep throat test of orange after a honeyed train of spice lightly closes this out superb  i like it very smooth and finishes well on the back of my tongue thank you  my favourite whiskey this is smooth and easy to drink it has a pleasant flavour mildly orangey honey with a bit of salt and a little heat at the end a fairly new discovery for me and i will be returning  i 39 ve seen others post updated reviews before so i thought i 39 d do the same since this is the only bottle of whiskey i have on hand at the moment i decided to pour another dram today this time i added a generous amount of water the change was remarkable still a lot of sweetness on the nose but the palate now features the brininess i 39 ve come to expect and love from the islay scotches other reviews i 39 ve seen online have noted oban 14 39 s mercurial nature able to live in both the islay and speyside worlds now i see exactly what they mean  this whiskey is too sweet for me and there 39 s not enough complexity to balance out the sweetness what makes this drinkable for me is the complex finish which as others noted does open up some interesting flavours i just wish those flavors were more up front i can definitely see why others enjoy this so much but it isn 39 t my style  whisky is subjective drink it with water not sparkling and never cold and make sure you haven 39 t eaten spicy food this is a very enjoyable malt its not peaty like islay whiskies so you shouldn 39 t compare them this is quality i actually tasted the oban 18 i gave as a gift to a friend it was a huge hit with everyone tarrifs have driven the price to 125 but i 39 m thinking the 14 will be equally good at the next reunion  drink of the gods  complex fruity and a nice long finish slightly sharp for my palette i genuinely think it is very tough to find a better tasting let alone better value whisky than this if you ve got between 163 0 163 40 amp 163 60 to try a whisky try this it has a lot of depth without being unapproachable  one of my favorites i 39 ve had a little water brings out the flavor more very smooth and slightly sweet not very smoky which i actually prefer  an amazing scotch that has long been my favourite it is a perfect gift for newer scotch drinkers who want a more complex tasting experience the price has shot up in the last 5 years i used to buy for 80aud but it won a load of awards and now costs 110aud if it 39 s ever on special buy a bottle you won 39 t regret it  a bit too gentle and not much character would like more complexity can get better for the price but i enjoyed it nonetheless whats there is good and delicious don 39 t need water a bit fragile  this excellent single malt was purchased by a friend for my 80th birthday and in these days of lockdown is providing me with much solace  favourite whisky nice sweet fruity oak taste great on the palate nice smokiness from a non islay a lovely dram easily one of my favourites if a little over priced  as per the summary this is a very drinkable interesting dram that balances a smooth richness with some smokey stimulation you have to take price into consideration though which is the only negative here it doesn 39 t quite deserve to be as expensive as it is  delicious with a delightful fruitiness great for sipping as very much a newcomer to malts i find this very pleasant having tried glen scotia 1832 too much for my first whisky experience then a nas dalwhinnie too much cinnamon and sharpness for me and finally striking gold with talisker 10 i definitely prefer the smokier styles with the oban 14 i got orange and vanilla on the nose a citrus and sweet palate with a hint of salt followed by a very short light hay finish i couldn 39 t get any smoke or peat at all a pleasant enough dram for a light evening but i don 39 t think i 39 ll be replacing my bottle once it 39 s finished  one of my favourites smooth with the right amount of smokey perfect  for me it is just a perfect whisky smooth interesting with a lovely briny taste delicious  this is my current favorite whiskey scotch very smooth  punchy and full of deep flavours can make you catch your breath not too peaty or smokey not too sweet lovely finish very enjoyable and i needed a noticeable change from my glengoyne and glenrothes staples  i m not a traditional scotch drinker but i loved the smooth oban hard to stop drinking it i highly recommend this brew for a quality scotch experience  super whisky great introduction to the smoky whiskies if you are new to them thick and silky medicinal notes clear i smell mint  smokey nose sweet with grilled orange amp candied peel taste lightly peated with a salty tail just enough to remind you it shares its beach waters with the islands can get this in macro supermarket in belfast for under 163 38  light dram but still good a must have in everyone s collection i am extremely sceptical about reviews which proclaim a dram quot the nectar of the gods quot or quot tastes of nothing quot sadly we have all become used to the penny pinching and downright lies of the new breed of corporate ceos infecting scotland but i don 39 t think oban has fallen victim to them yet whisky should be assessed on its own terms it is simply wrong to give a one star review for glenmorangie because quot this tastes nothing like laphroig quot or to expect a ten year old to stand up to a thirty five year old for smoothness the question is what kind of a whisky is it and how well is it made so what is oban it is a medium bodied slightly smoky slightly sweet quite young single malt i like it i find it has a seaside tang and mix of bitter sweet peat which is both balanced and well thought out i prefer it to caol ila 12 because it 39 s a bit different a bit rough around the edges with a lemon pepper salt aftertaste some people have talked about a rough alcohol burn i don 39 t find it rough i find it very honest i get a nice clean barley mash taste which jack daniels et al could learn from  i 39 m more of an islay drinker this is a good dram if looking for something light with a subtle honey and very light smoke flavor upfront that fades rather quickly next time i 39 ll be picking up something with a little more balls and character  αν κάποιος θέλει πολύ καπνό και τύρφη δεν χρειάζεται να μπαίνει στα highlands υπάρχει το islay θα συμβούλευα λοιπόν αυτούς τους φίλους να μη φορτώνουν το κεφάλι μας με κριτικές που είναι δεδομένο ότι θα είναι αρνητικές αφού η προτίμησή τους για τα δυνατά καπνικά δεν τους αφήνει να είναι αντικειμενικοί  this is a smooth and classy whisky for those who like smooth and drinkable malt whiskies this compares with dalwhinnie and blair athol it is a pleasure  it 39 s smooth nice complexity but tastes a bit light and bland would prefer lagavulin 16 or a campbeltown this is one of the standard bearers for being balanced while still maintaining complexity and a depth of flavour if you 39 d like to delve into peat and aren 39 t sure where to begin this would be a good target for reek lovers like myself there is still enough there to keep you interest while exposing a wonderful and full palate an incredible dram for a warm evening  this is a standard bearer for balance without having muted the complexity it 39 s a nice intro to smoke if you aren 39 t sure and a great everyday dram wonderful on a warm summer evening  i am really more into peaty and strong whisky but this one woo really lovely stuff it is so well balance with great switness and a perfect vanilla taste it surprised me and i actually enjoyed it a lot will buy a bottle for sure  i 39 ve had mixed luck with this one the 1st bottle i got from a supermarket on special offer and i was excited to try it i kept it like a trophy while i polished of the last of the other bottles however my first taste left me dissapointed the finish reminded me of coach sick and was really rather unpleasant it felt thin in the mouth and not as complex as i 39 d like a 14yr old to be that being said i decided to give it another chance at a bar and it was a completely different creature rich and full on the nose salty sea air and honied the mouth was full almost oily a pleasure all round perhaps i caught a poor batch reviewer m a horrell one is the best single malts i 39 ve tasted  it 39 s a nice whisky but it 39 s not made in oban it used to be when i lived there you could visit the 1794 distillery building and see the whisky being made but it then moved to some gleaming factory in the middle of nowhere i 39 m not sure what that did to its quality  tasted it the other night at a whiskey bar for the first time and i had an immediate tasting note of soapiness i didn 39 t share that with my wife who also had a taste and believe it or not said quot it tastes like soap quot not sure what gives this taste but have not tasted it in any other single malt  i never cease to be amazed by the diversity of opinion on any malt it is truly a matter of individual palate this to me is on the sweet side of the spectrum with a smoothness which makes it very likeable and a very pleasant smooth afters i really like oban my son s favourite whisky for me there is a fresh sea like quality to the nose and a pleasant sweet aftertaste with a hint of smoke that lingers well the palate lets it down a little with not a great deal coming through overall the aftertaste makes it a decent if not outstanding choice  this is a unique whisky from a unique part of scotland you can taste the seaweed and smell the sea and some herbally citrus nice balance of richness and bite  loved it since first tried 15 years ago going through whole bottle same evening go redskins  commercial malt made in volume for the masses not very peaty vaguely smokey rather sweet very bland and ordinary lacking character or any complexity i 39 m trying to remember anything at all about it and cant if you think this is the 39 good stuff 39 then lord knows what you drank before all i can say is get yourself a bottle of lagavulin 16 springbank 10 or clynlish 14 you will be amazed  this is a dram that can be enjoyed at the beginning of any night an everyday whisky that is classy it 39 s delightful and flavorsome many a bottle has been polished without even realizing  considering its a 14 yr old love the aroma very pleasant smooth tasting for the price i would it a 41 2 i love it it s complex it s fresh a lot of citrus it makes you want more and more for a 14year old and for this price don t even think about it wish they didn t color it but regardless a fantastic dram  this is the single malt that launched my exploration of fine scotch and it is one to which i return frequently always a happy home coming some scotches assault you with peat and smoke and while i 39 ve developed a taste for them sometimes it 39 s nice to savor a dram of something more demure oban fills that niche the hints of smokiness are certainly there but as it unfurls on the taste buds other flavors manifest themselves as noted above oban thus has a subtle complexity that i really enjoy it 39 s rich in character without being overwhelming  moving from california to the mid west every time i decide to pour a glass it takes me back to being on the beach if you are opening a new bottle let the glass sit for a bit on the first pour some of that burn others speak of will mellow out a nice testament to whiskey 39 s ability to transport you to another place never lets me down cheers  deadset their are some 39 i only drink neat 39 muppets concede a dash of water might tame the abv but refuse to do it despite science and master distillers telling you to do so then whine about 39 burn 39  not normally a scotch drinker even though my dad was born in scotland tried oban years ago because my grandfather was stationed in oban during wwi for a non scotch drinker this has become my go to when i do drink scotch can 39 t explain the technicalities but having tried many scotches i keep coming back to this i try to lay off the hard stuff and my regular drink these days is founders dirty bastard scotch ale wee heavy if you are looking for something lighter try it it won 39 t disappoint  the official tasting notes by the quot chaps at masters of malt quot are v accurate certainly dominant nose is sweet smokey ester and cut hay with light citrus on the mouth well balanced dram indeed however what is omitted and really detracts from this is the nasty alcohol burn on the tongue and fumey after taste again think the bassociated with ester extremely noticable and undeniable really detracts from this otherwise exellent dram maybe some drops of water would tame this but i only drink neat shame about the nasty burn that means this good dram could never be considered a great dram however it is priced as a great dram 3 1 2 stars from me  i used to live in sacramento and there was a bar that had over 20 single malts to sample i was a scotch novice and this was my first and i was hooked i love this spirit and it always my go to and i have tried many other single malts the oran 14 is well balanced a great everyday dram without breaking the bank it is just enough smoke and character to make it interesting a favorite of mine available in lots of places as well  well what can i say this is in my top 3 whiskies along with laphroaig glenlivet nadurra in no particular order it is quite simply a superb whisky i love the oily characteristics add a wee drop of water give it a swirl you 39 ll see what i mean the hint of salt too and it is sooooo smooth i am actually from oban but i am no biased by any means i just love this whisky and i can get it for 163 4 for a double in spoons just about 100 yes from distillery oh and my mate is now taking the tours sooooo mates rates will prevail for bottles from now on  nice single malt not as sweet as mac 12 or as smooth as mac 18 or as complex as jw blue blend or as smoky as jw platinum enjoyed it very much especially for the price  perhaps i 39 m prejudiced this being the first single malt scotch i ever tasted however after a decade and a half of sampling others the oban is still my favorite for casual drinking the price makes it an affordable well s m s for the home bar but the quality never fails to impress  superb great vaule for a great dram  was introduced exactly one month ago felled in love after the first sip since then have been quietly buying to build up my hoard where have you been all these years alanooi yahoo com sweet honey on the nose caramel toffee honey and sweet fruits on the palate medium smooth finish good for the price but i still prefer glenfiddich 12  smooth and interesting dances on the roof of the mouth on its way to the sinuses very satisfying  rich complex and satisfying surprisingly full bodied and interesting for a 14 year this is a hidden gem considering the price  delicious slightly smoky smooth scotch my tasting notes for oban 14 would be soft smooth sweet amp slightly smoky but why the added caramel  i really enjoy the taste and feel it ranks with other brands more expensive bottles for the money i feel this is a great choice  together with a maturation period of 14 years and a rich taste the smoke gives more complexity to this masterpiece of a whisky very good no bitterness peat sweet and well balanced oban 14 and talisker 10 have to be the winners among the classic malts  wonderful just the right balance  its a master whisky with a clean clear taste no bitterness and a smooth rounded finish my new favourite great sipping scotch the kind you can get people who don 39 t like scotch to like it negatives would be that it 39 s a little too pricey 78 tax included specs american 39 s and it can sometimes be hard to get guy said he had to quot go in the back back quot to get most recent purchase  wow what a great well rounded whisky sweet spicey and just a whiff a of smoke mothers milk  my head registers quality when it comes to liquor there are only two alcohols that do not give me a headache oban scotch and grey goose vodka every other liquor including champagne gives me 3 to 4 day headache after even one drink so oban must be very pure and delicious it is that  tried this for the first time today i found the above tasting notes to be spot on as far as the nose is concerned it is indeed rich and smokey but when i tasted it found it to be incredibly smooth and no hint of smoke an amazing whiskey and definatly one of my favourites  i have always been sceptical when bar staff or reviews have told me of the 39 salty 39 notes of a whisky the i tried oban 14 i was astounded that for the first time i could feel the subtle suggestion of salt and the seaside on my palette and nose i think the tasting notes above are pretty accurate possibly a good introduction to smoke peat as it 39 s not too heavy reasonable sweet a little peppery and a really interesting drink  tried last night amazing whisky drink it straight  i had the pleasure of tasting this while on vacation in scotland can 39 t wait to have it again  i 39 m a the glenlivet man oban 14 yr was a birthday gift from my son and daughter in law i was surprised it has a stronger bouquet and a sharper after taste the the glenlivet a pleasant single malt  i truly believe oban answers that question in the affirmative you allow this thin liquid to roll around the insideof your mouth and by some miracle it turns into a vanilla caramel cream candy you let it gently slide down yourthroat and you are left with a butterscotch flambe finish wow 4 december 2016 i love scotch scotchy scotch scotch here it goes down down into my belly but seriously on a cool fall evening after having shared an intimate night with my lover i sat fireside in my robe pondering life and sipping on a glass of oban 14 as i drank the smooth smoky concoction i was instantly taken back to a simpler time hunting trips with my late father in the low country of georgia our english pointer sniffing out quail as snow fall cascaded down from the heavens it was that hunting trip in the safety of our cabin that my father let me try a sip of his scotch whiskey for the first time oban 14 brings me back to this every time  delicious unique single malt oban 14 39 s lingering caramel palate is complemented with almost bourbon like notes a dandy at 60  paid over 75 00 assuming price mattered but found elsewhere under 50 00 this is smooth and has a great finish it 39 s color doesn 39 t speak to its depth will buy again  i love to just take one zip at the time holding it and let the flavor penetrates my mouth and tongue wonderful tasteand flavor bombardment afterwards in the whole mouth worth all the money i 39 ve tried nearly everything this is my gold standard it 39 s just incredibly balanced you drink this neat if you put cubes near it you are a barbarian just can 39 t find enough good to say about this they have it all right  i must not have the class the others have on this site have i tried a 16 oo glass on ice i wanted to like it and truly had a tough time picking anything flavorful about it i admit i have little experience in knowing what i 39 m looking for beside something that taste good and too me this did not taste good the taste reminded me of the smell of the medicine kit we use to have when i played football  honestly i don 39 t know what the review were just talking about i am a fan of irish whiskey and kentucky bourbon and i found this highland whisky to be balanced and delicious without a hint of smoke  a delightful single malt with a smooth finish so glad i tried it  strong and smokey on the tongue with a likeable flavour but aftertaste slightly harsh for my liking certainly worth trying if you haven 39 t tasted before  this is freshly cut grass on a summer 39 s day wonderfully light and subtle an uplifting dram  not bad but would still prefer a talisker dark storm to it as an islay drinker i found this to be a bit too harsh it finishes well vey well but somewhat aggressive on the way down if you like the burn of a good burbon you will ike the whiskey  had this year 39 s ago and it lingered with me as one of the few scotches i could drink neat now on vacation i was thrilled to see it in the bar and it reaffirmed my original opinion just a delightful smooth taste that fills the mouth with fantastic flavors in the best possible way this is a scotch i 39 d recommend to someone who usually doesn 39 t drink whiskey neat i prefer it over macallan 15 way smoother in my opinion  if anyone knows of a better whisky than this for under 163 50 please let me know this is still my favorite after 10 years with whisky it is complex balanced and full of fantastic flavour i 39 ve tried plenty within the different regions and this still beats the rest for my palate after weeks of trying other whiskies in bars at friends and such i bring this bottle back for a taste and i 39 m like quot there it is hello old friend quot it will always have a place in my whisky cabinet sl 224 inte  my son treated me with this one and it was a hit from the first sip right away the sweetness hits and then the flavor its just one of the best drams i have ever tried i can only recommend it especially if you like peated whisky but want the peat smoke to be less dominant  beautiful so very smoothe with an excellent finish this scotch should only be had neat  a delicious smooth scotch for me as a beer judge it is the smoothest lovely aroma and tasting whisky the creme de la creme in whisky i would not need another brand although a friend made a whisky with maris otter malt and that was exceptional good too  i 39 ve been rebuilding my single malt collection after a move and just acquired the oban just superb it s just a hint sweeter and a shade less smokey than laphroig so i would say smoother but these subjective phrases are difficult to describe the oban is simply beautiful  really good single malt very rounded smokey and sweet very well balanced i must say like it very much and trying to keep in my collection always  smooth single malt probably the best that is out there today in this price range highly recommend  normally i like very smokey single malts but sometimes i feel to have something in between then oben 14 is the best it 39 s smokey sweet and fruitty very well balanced  i put this above many more expensive single malts i 39 ve been drinking oban for over 20 years i went to a good friend 39 s 50th birthday he is a scotch drinker usually jb i gifted him a bottle of oban two weeks later i saw him again the first thing he said to me was quot damn you anyway quot i said quot what did i do quot he said quot you got me hooked on 80 00 a bottle scotch quot  i must admit that i don 39 t actually like it very much my rating is more of a nod of the head for the quality and execution i 39 ve visited the distillery and had a dram straight from the cask from a 12 year old oban and it was nice so i bought a little bottle much to the consternation of the missus if you ever hear someone talk with reverence from scottish single malts and recite the usual clich 233 s about complexity delicacy depth and breadth of flavours you might get the idea to give it a try for a perfect example look no further i bought a 20 cl bottle and while at the end it has gone slightly flat and dull i must admit i am blown away by this whisky i simply cannot begin to describe the extraordinary depth that is in this liquid as it is known oban has very long distillation close to 120 hours which gives it an estery quality and a special scent and flavour sometimes reminiscent of fruit peels they also treat their spirit very delicately they don 39 t use first fill casks so as not to overpower the original taste casks should only make a contribution not dominate the malt they use is peated to 1 ppm which is very very light but it 39 s still there also becasue of the maturation and or because the distillation takes place on the coast there is some sea salt detectable in the whisky all in all if you drink this whisky several times you will find the results of all the above influences and more i remember when i opened the bottle i found the whisky too peaty somehow just being off for my nose then as it decanted and mellowed i could find the orange peels and the peat was a bit more manageable then i tasted it and i felt the bourbon cask at the start but then it turned salty and then with every sip the salt aftertaste was stronger and stronger until eventually it felt like when as a child an ocean wave hit me in the face and the salty water went up my nose the sensation reminded me of that exact experience i actually thought i made a mistake buying it in the first place next time i drank it the peat was very subdued and so was the salt and there were absolute bags of fruits and strong pleasant oaky aromas the third time it was bourbon like a bit sweeter fierier than i remembered and every other time i found a different whisky than on the occasion before to sum up then this is an extraordinary whisky to me it 39 s like a chameleon every single time you try it you will be overwhelmed by some other detail that you missed the last time around you could drink a glass every day for the rest of your life and never ever tire of it if there ever was a drink to have around a log fire to quietly reflect ponder and contemplate this one is it i tried countless malts ranging from 25 163 to 180 163 a bottle and mark my words this is hugely underpriced  this whisky hits every mark with excellence a sweet nose where even the berries come through to a novice the flavor is full and rich beyond its 14 years the finish is clean with a hint of peat uncommon to the other highlands the honey comes through in every note in my opinion it is the ultimate whisky under 25 years pairing just as nicely with a cohiba maduro as it does with a prime cut of ribeye i find similarities with the mccallan 15 fine oak triple cask  a far better whisky than most of the current reviews suggest the initial sweet hit on the nose and the start makes you think that you are in for something from the spey however there is enough smoke and peaty richness on the palate to kick you in a very different direction rather quickly after that the finish is also much more from the islands than the mainland a very pleasant and complex drop  i had it at 2 places and nothing compares to its smooth flavor  quot if you like islay 39 s don 39 t drink this quot really cause i adore bruchladdich lagavulin ardbeg and all the islay malts and i found this malt to be thoroughly enjoyable the nose was fantastic subtle undertones of smoke and vanilla picked out the citrus notes found the body to be a good amount of fullness not nearly as heavy as lagavulin which i find strangley pleasant but it went down beautifully i 39 m still drinking it now big thumbs up oban i guess my palate is quite spoiled as my last three bottles were all in the 75 year old vintage it was like drinking butter the oban received as a gift is quite tasty almost too complex there is an incredible sharp crisp after taste that lingers i am not sure what it reminds me of there are some scotch that i would lean on as the quot after a good steak quot drink i am not certain that this would qualify as for me it lacks the smoothness that i prefer nevertheless it is still a good tasting drink  i tried it after a highland park 12 and a laphroaig it was almost difficult to drink it after the other 2 wich i enjoyed very much this was the second time i tried it and mostly because the first time was in a beach bar and thought i didn 39 t like it because of the exposure to the sun but second time was again very unpleasant  loved it super smooth great way to finish a lovely birthday dinner  after doing a private taste with quot highland park quot 7 10 quot laphroaig quot 8 10 and quot oban quot oban is a disappointment 4 10 at most and generous if you like islay whiskeys this not for you and in my opinion this is a cheap trick i find ordinary whiskeys better first time i tried in beach bar though the bad taste might be because of the exposure to the sun second time i 39 m convinced that it is not the sun  quot it tastes like paint thinner and down the drain it went quot you poured a 60 bottle of scotch down the drain yeah right honestly if you 39 re going to make up stories like that why not go to the comments section of youtube where your input would be in like company  giving this one a second try first time wasn 39 t overly impressed and it 39 s actually a lot better than the first bottle i bought very sweet fruity oak followed by roasted vanilla beans and just a hint of smoke not very coastal tasting though i also have clynelish 14 right now and have determined that oban is smoother sweeter but clynelish is more smoky coastal also a little bit stronger i personally prefer clynelish but this is a very nice dram and well worth buying again very happy with it the sugarbear wow this is an incredible scotch it 39 s one of those keep in your cabinet scotches given the flavor for the cost super well balanced smokey oaky some little hidden vanilla notes and a very pleasant hay flavor it 39 s also nice on the nose it 39 s one of those scotches you could spend 30 minutes with your nose in the glass  he 39 s your makelele your kuyt your bellerin this is an unsung hero a julian cope a rick buckler i 39 m having one now and very much enjoying it i 39 m rambling now and should go to bed  sherry smoke rich a solid whiskey great addition to any collection   quot tastes like paint thinner and down the drain it went quot a why on earth would you be tasting paint thinner b are you prone to the odd 39 porky 39 now and again i would offer that this whisky is sometimes a tad overpriced like a few others yet for the price i paid i am impressed particularly with it 39 s 39 all rounder 39 qualities both on the nose and on the palate a bonnie wee toon as well  my mother won a bottle in a raffle for 50 pence shes not a big whiskey drinker so when she found out it sells for about 45gbp she decided to keep it for a special occasion damn stll a few years to my 50th guess i will have to wait till then to sample and give a review still at 50 pence a bottle it would still be value even if it does taste like paint thinners that some reviewers have equated it to never tried paint thinners so i would not now what it would taste like they must have drink problems if they lower themselves to that standard of drink  a very well balanced scotch long lasting finish fabulous on the nose great value for money  agree the best scotch i have ever had myself all in perfect balance  best bottle of scotch i have ever had it tastes like paint thinner and down the drain it went  very very smooth light wood smoke and medical notes yes marine themes gentle sweetness balanced against some bitterness great the finish with oak and then hints of orange and again some wood smoke dry at the end  in scotland looking at a new horse and fancied a dram oban 14 certainly hit the spot light smokey flavour with hints of sweetness and citrus perfect for an occasional nip standing in a wet and windy field 8 10  i recently bought a bottle of this from my local supermarket for half its usual price 163 48 down to 163 24 this was such a good deal that i snapped it up on the spot oban 14 really is in a category of its own a unique but perfectly balanced mix of different regional styles a definite highland single malt but with clear islay influences and a fair bit of speyside in there too on the nose initially it 39 s nowhere near as peaty and coastal as many reviews i 39 ve read have stated but the smoky peaty notes are there just not as pronounced as i thought they 39 d be then i swilled out my glencairn nosing glass with some warm boiled water and tried it again and the nose really opened up revealing a similar savoury nose to that of old pultney 12 but with a quite exquisite dark fruit that i couldn 39 t quite identify on the palate there 39 s a wonderful fruity floral spiciness with a hint of something that may be cinnamon or liquorice which reminds me of a good bourbon it 39 s lovely and smooth and mouth coating without any nasty alcohol burn the finish is fine with mainly orange dominating i 39 ve read some reviews that criticise the orange on the finish but i like it that liquorice or dark fruit makes a pleasant return on the finish too is it worth 163 48 absolutely not but at 163 24 i have to score it on the price i paid for it as value is a factor when i review any whisky overall this is a very good single malt that i 39 m glad to have found for such a good price my collection at the moment i always limit it to 7 bottles on the go at any one time is dominated by strong peaty islays and this bottle makes a refreshing change as it covers a lot of bases very well recommended  i love it easy to drink not complex but nor is it offensive in any way no acquiring of tastes required just pour and enjoy i like it on the rocks with water or straight but prefer it on the rocks as another reviewer mentioned it does make a nice aperitif i couldn 39 t give it five stars because the orange flavor does linger a bit too long  oban very nice 14 year single malt scotch i am a 12 and 18 21 year glenfiddich scotch drinker i am very impressed will keep this one around for the cold nights by the fire thank youdennis banks as a visiting scot to the u s i was offered this by my host the other night straight up it is medicinal but cut with water and no ice it truly offers up its real variety of characteristics a very good after dinner dram not for social imbibing this is my go to whisky at the mo for me it 39 s the right balance of peat it 39 s a smooth swallow and has enjoyable flavours all round  i 39 ll hold off on providing an actual star rating as i am largely unfamiliar with the smoky scotches but i was able to try a dram of this yesterday evening and found it be basically undrinkable a lot of the reviews here indicate a light smokiness but the dram i had reaked of smoke and sea and if that was light smoke then i can 39 t imagine how smoky a lagavulin would be it was definitely not for me  as ron burgundy said quot scotchy scotch scotch quot this is the scotch i think about a great smooth scotch to end the night with and i have done that plenty  i really enjoyed oban 14 it has a great floral nose and taste with just a hint of smoke but it really shouldn 39 t scare off people who aren 39 t partial to peaty smokey islay malts it 39 s just a nice little cherry on top of the bright and uplifting flavor this brings to the tablewill absolutely be buying another bottle the price ranges from as low as 62 75 in ct a fine drink but the medicinal notes and tarry ropes are faint whispers in the background i get more orange and oak to the fore the orange is interesting but out of place for me in much the same way as a slice of orange doesn 39 t work in a cup of tea the rest actually reminds me of a balvenie pretty boring oakfest when i first tried oban 14 several years ago i enjoyed it but it didn 39 t really stand out for me but up to that point i had only really tried the most common generally light speyside single malts over the years i 39 ve gained a lot more experience and having recently revisited oban a few times i really appreciate it for its overall quality its richness and its distinctive balance of flavors lots of different elements represented in a subtle but very satisfying way if you 39 re in the mood for something very quot easy quot to drink but with more fullness and character than average this is truly a winner the tasting notes here could be misleading medicinal notes and quot notes of the sea quot are definitely present but not at all in the sense of a laphroaig or lagavulin again its just much more subtle as far as those elements go  a very different dram than what i was anticipating a nice hint of smoke with some dark fruits like raisins and figs finshed with a hint of salty air very elegant and smooth one of my new favorites for sure  considering the age and price of this whisky i expected more smoothness and complexity the palate is still reasonable but the finish is too much dry oak and lacks refinement for my taste overall i 39 d say it 39 s more strong or harsh rather than rich  for the price i was expecting something more complex or deep truth is this is one of the blandest most unimpressive scotches i 39 ve tasted  i 39 m usually more of a peaty smokey scotch fan like laphroaig but i had oban on a whim in a bar and was really surprised by what a sweet scotch can do you can really taste note of honey there  it 39 s a very nice whisky subtle balanced and easy to drink it 39 s not the most interesting whisky in my opinion but it 39 s a solid choice and a crowd pleaser i 39 ve never met anybody that disliked it one can offer it to guests or buy it as a gift  given the age and excellent reviews my expectation was somewhat higher perfectly pleasant to drink but not as special as the price and age would suggest my view is that tobermory 10 year old is arguably superior and their other product ledaig peated far superior beauty and taste is in the eye of the beholder of course  i 39 ve just recently tried the oban 14 at a local quot irish pub quot i live in south carolina and was enthralled i usually don 39 t like peaty whiskeys but this was very subtle on the smokiness and yet full of flavor i liked it so much that i 39 ve had it the last several times we 39 d been back to this bar and have enjoyed it even more each time it reminds me of talisker 10 except not as strong and a more subtle peatiness i love it i 39 ve just ordered a bottle from an online source and got a very good price on it i can 39 t wait to get it and have a dram along with a cold smihtwick 39 s cheers  this is the single malt that really got me into single malts i 39 m an islay fan but nothing tastes like oban great light oak and vanilla starts this one off develops into a very floral and fruity body with a peppery slightly salty smoke finish there will always be a place for this whisky in my cabinet  i bought a 20cl bottle to try and was quite impressed it 39 s subtle but complex i thought the smoke was very slight but it was definitely there  pleasant smoky aroma you can taste the salinity of the sea and a burst of spice a simple dram that i enjoyed but definitely feel there are other options to consider when dealing within this price range and age bracket don 39 39 t feel i 39 39 ll explore this again but am happy i did try it since other i know have enjoyed this bottle  oban 14 is my birthday gift to myself year after year and it never fails to both charm and satisfy a breath of smoke yet easy on the palate i must agree with the fellow who feels it is at its best neat and it rewards slow savoring and holding on the tongue this whisky is magnificent  love this whisky balanced sweetness complex layers excellent whiskey  if you like smooth and light and more on the fruity vanilla side this one is a nice scotch if you are looking for strength and peat this in not the one  i just bought a bottle in istanbul i live there and a few months back the single malt selection has enlivened when i saw it on the shelf i thought this christmas i 39 m going for it just opened it and am on another planet a little water is how i like it happy holidays  i 39 ve been sampling for scotches for a while now and oban 14 isn 39 t describable in terms of any other whisky i 39 ve tried it really is a hybrid between the highlands and islay definitely not as smoky as islay but the smoke is there it 39 s light and fragrant like a highland but noticeably different there is a sweetness and levity about it it 39 s not honey or toffee or chocolate it might be citrus but i might say that for lack of a better word in any case it 39 s very good and i wouldn 39 t discourage anyone from trying it you might find a new favorite  i usually prefer a dram with a touch of pure water not this one neat is the only way to go it has a very complex flavor on the front end as you let it rest on the palate the flavors explode sweet rich smoky it finishes lightly peated and dry adding water takes all the complexity out and changes it to a fruity light and very average with no depth  nice balance between the smoky and the sweet  never having tried single malt until oban 14 am now a convert rich and creamy and slightly sweet perfect with cheese and salami excellent nose sweet and smoky very promising the palate is smooth even more so with added water and sweet with a hint of peat but lacks any complexity the finish for me was disappointing due to a very alcoholic and sort of chemical aftertaste that the whisky left  i don 39 t get the tasting notes rich and smoky seaweed or medicinal at all i can 39 t really identify the flavours in oban 14 and yet i like it more over time as one below said easy to drink i find it has some depth of character but still have no idea how to describe it 39 s flavours it is for me a very pleasant mystery  excellent flavor a go to scotch when out at a nice bar oban 14 is an easy whisky to drink but i would rather have the 10 yr old which is not available in the us not sure how anyone is finding this dram too harsh it 39 s a pretty easy drinking one not exactly an ardbeg anyhow bit of a girls whisky but delishus hic anyway loving it til it s gone and then it is what it was  love that whisky but it s to exspensiv for me so only at christmas   the aftertouch is definatelly woody with a slight hint of peat i m writing this as i am zipping my oban 14 yrs it s a balanced whiskey with smoothhness sweet fruity body and a light peaty aftertouch i would recommend this to newcomers or blend drinkers  this was ok i tried this at bar a bar in l a called seven grand nothing really unique you won t buy any nas whisky that s incredibly short sighted some fantastic whiskies carry no age statements look at the ardbegs for example glengoyne cask stregth glendronach cask strength glenfarclas 105 the list goes on i can understand where you are coming from and your feeling cheated by the trend from some of the larger distilleries cough macallan cough to steer away from age statements in an effort to stretch out stock however sometimes an age statement is omitted because there are occasions when casks will be at their optimum for a particular expression before a certain time period is up for many reasons and so i can understand some distilleries omitting them for some expressions i am not sure that this is the case with oban however each to their own and all and of course whisky taste is a very personal thing but laphroaig 10 is chill filtered and bottled at 40 quarter cask is non chill filtered and bottled at 48 i think you re foolish to say you d buy the 10 which is an alright to good whisky but not the qc which is a great full flavoured whisky just because it does t carry an age statement if it bothers you that much i l tell you now it s about 5 or 6 years old  a few months ago i bought a bottle of oban 14 in france where the prices for scotch whisky are around half what i pay in ontario when i got home and tried it i found it harsh and disappointing and not at all like i remembered oban to be like reading the label carefully i noticed there is no age listed it s called oban 14 but never once is it described as quot 14 years old quot there s no distilling or bottling date it makes me wonder if this quot oban 14 quot is much younger than 14 years old scotch is very popular and many of the producers are blending their old whisky with younger stuff to stretch out their stock of course that can only go on so long if you sell more than you produce i will no longer buy any whisky that doesn t have an age specified on the label similarly i don t buy laphroaig quarter cask i only buy the 10 or 18 year old  as i sip this i am reminded more of a blended whisky than a single malt there is little depth it is very light there is nothing wrong with it but there us nothing to interest or excite me  i wanted to love this one but it s either too simple or the flavors are way too subtle i guess it would define quot easy drinking quot but when you re after interesting flavors there s sadly just not much going on in the oban  i m really have never been into scotch but i received a bottle of oban for my 60th birthday may 10th as am writing this note while sipping on my oban i must tell you quot wow quot what a magnificent taste i m hooked  definitely clean and smooth as butter but lacking flavour almost too subtle i cannot see where everyone finds smoke here i cannot feel almost any at all just a hint  so comforting so balanced this glass of smokey sweetness brings you home warm and comfortable tastes like scotch with a touch of everything wonderful  bought from the distillery well balanced ight with only a hint of smoke lots of dark fruit plums and blackberries bit of sugar and vanilla aroma in the glass after the dram was consumed solid offering if a little underwhelming for the price tastes younger than 14yr the barrel has not taken over the spirit  this scotch has a very crisp almost refreshing clean taste definitely a great quot teens quot scotch probably the best i like balvenie but sometimes those are too syrupy the oban 14 is on the other side spectrum different but great  picked up a bottle at the distillery without water lovely drop the distillery had a teat papette allowing the addition of a couple of drops of water wow i add mineral water to whiskey but the tiniest amount just releases the aromas and smooths this craitur off beautifully another nip at home and with less control over the water added more pretty much killed the aroma and oversoftened the drink better without best with just drops brilliant any way  i thoroughly enjoyed a bottle with a friend both of us will be purchasing this whisky again not as harsh as the majority of malts however please also allow me to vent my cinfusion at a comment left by the sea the sea when the person wrote nose brought me to the beach a salty slightly fishy breeze hands are holding some vanilla and some orange peel taste revealed a small bonfire of smoke near the ocean dried oak burning dried orange in mouth then salty finish a nice trip to the sea one problem is notes of glue fades after a few days upon opening you are nothing but a fool to write such a pompous poem like review i hope one day in the future you get a life  5 stars are doing it an injustuce an outdoorsy sort of dram  a flavor where peat tastings are pleasurably undeniable hints of smoke in the finish and the quot just right quot citrus overtone the 14 is delightful and delicious with a good cigar very much a fan seaside in the open fire roaring cigar in had bliss  i thought oban 14 had a harsh kick that ruined the flavor not for me  nose brought me to the beach a salty slightly fishy breeze hands are holding some vanilla and some orange peel taste revealed a small bonfire of smoke near the ocean dried oak burning dried orange in mouth then salty finish a nice trip to the sea one problem is notes of glue fades after a few days upon opening  this malt is simply stunning it has everything peat smoke sweetness fruity smoothness and a decent length finish one of my first choice malts and easy to obtain althoug i like peat a lot of it like ardberg is to much for me oban has a subtile peaty taste combined with orangy taste this is a great balance with a small splash of water this whisky is super smooth hi there we re actually due a delivery before the end of this week so do check back and you ll be able to get a bottle without a problem the chaps at master of malt kindly tell me when oban is back in stockregards ian hall ianhall20 yahoo co uk had a bottle of this bought for me and i have to say it s the finest bottle of scotch i ve ever tasted will definitely be buying a refill  great taste taste that stays in ur mouth for a while after drinking it must have for whiskey lovers  was a big burboun guy for years got turned on to scotch last year at super bowl party and have tried many since then and love the complex notes of scotch particularly this one looking forward to trying others  my absolute favorite scotch a great single malt for me is one of the best spectacular  a very nice scotch smooth and full flavored some smoke and some peat as a huge fan of quot the peat quot this one is lighter than i would prefer but a very good one for those who are new to quot peat and smoke quot should be in everyone s collection  agradable olor sabor a mar tierra humeda y maderas nobles  smooth and easily drinkable would i buy another bottle yes this is the very first single malt i tried n i loved it its awesome especially for people who want it light m a fan now  fruit light smoke orange marmalade mellow extra sweet and smooth with a drop of water great but not much of a finish my introduction to single malt scotch almost thirty years ago was glenmorangie and i knew i was introuble i was attracked to it s vanella and slight cereaminess over the years i i have taisted countless scotches too peaty too salty pow too much alcohol in the nose but then i was in a bar in los angeles of all places when i asked the bar keep what he drinks when he pours himself a drink he pulled down the bottle of oban pours me a good measure drops a sinlgle ice cube in it and that was it i found my home a perfectly balanced single malt scotch creamy rich with just enough smoke it is a sublime drink  great tasting whisky  in un viaggio in moto in scozia dopo cena ci siamo fatti un scotch whisky ogni giorno di diverese marche abbiamo tratto le conclusioni che oban 14 fosse il migliore whisky di tutti quelli assaggiati delicato e piacevole nel sorseggio  a well balanced all rounder will buy again  i bought this because not only was it very highly rated but i couldn t find two reviews that agreed with each other i opened it a little while ago and this blew my head off nose sweet toffee musket grapes samos desert wine rum brown sugar golden virginia tobacco maraschino cherries toffee pudding pecan pie short bread shortcrust pastry lemon meringue pie rose apricot jam dark chocolate turkish delight batternberg chocolate truflestaste cut hay cherry pie sweet tobacco cashews smokey rope dry grass bitter coffee stewed tea walnut whip black treacle marzipan smoke stewed plum rubarb and custard boiled sweets christmas cake icing orange peel orange bitters believe the hype its amazing  has been my favorite for over 20 years now having branched out to canada and japan i still cannot find it s equal one of my favourite malts amp at a reasonable price i have overpaid for this dram a few times but i never really regret it such is it s quality highly peaty with dark rich fruit notes for those not wanting a malt as powerful and smoky as talisker or as peaty as laphroig ardberg port charlotte this is a great compromise the finish is long and deep with hints of smoke spice and pepper whilst baked apple and rich honeyed mulled berries underlies the warmer more colourful notes a superb malt highly recommended amp if this is to your taste why not go ahead and try the talisker 10 yr old a true beast  this is an exceedingly complex whisky a very strong and intricate nose with a medicinal palate and evident cereal notes plenty of peat to go around i love the seaside taste of this one and i m sure to keep a bottle around at all times a unique and characteristic highland malt  just dabbling in single malts and found this incredible a touch of citrus and a bit o smoke which i understand to be peat very quot soft quot and smooth and a fine subtile after taste it has me very interetsed in a more variety of tasting thank you oban  i have bought a bottle of oban 43 at the auction but can t find it on here it s not got any age in years i e like 12 or 10 can anyone tell me how old this might be or how much it would cost to buy thanks yours freddy great whiskey  not for me found it too rich and smoky with a harsh after taste an acquired taste not for the faint hearted thanks to the sample bottles i ve not wasted too much money on a bottle that would have found its way to the back of the cupboard  oban am converted this is simply brilliant oranges sea salt and a touch of smoke very smooth very drinkable very tasty  the oban 14 was one of the first single malts i tried as it was part of the classic malts promotion packs at the time i really enjoyed it but as the years passed and my experience and single malt collection expanded i tended to let my oban 14 bottle gather dust thinking that i would not enjoy it anymore as i had liked it when i was inexperienced then recently i tried it again and i was wowed rich creamy sweet but not overly so and the rich saltiness of salt toffee wonderful for neophytes and experts alike  fab whisky hard to get hold of in england but well worth the trouble  a surprise a light peaty taste orange and smokey just fantastic dram this is my current favorite whiskey  this is an epic dram a lot is going in the nose eg smoky juicy oranges thoroughly thick palate delivering what the nose had acknowledged  a bit peaty delicious oranges in the nose with perfect oily texture and a characterful finish it is a great whisky i wish there was a cask strength edition of this nice tipple 
1855.0, my first real foray into peated whiskies and i was pleasantly surprised easy drinking with the sherry taking the edge off the peat making it far more palatable  down in the deepest south when the damp evenings turn cool or positively cold on the cloudless highveld nights then it time for the sweet peat treat that is this wholesome malt smoothe and silky sweet to peat to sweet again you can t go wrong at this price better than the 18 by far  love it vanilla undertones with enough peat for my taste they sherry is a bit sharp on the nose but the taste is spot on  i really rate this islay single malt compare it with its local peers from islay and you 39 ll soon see this is a peaty whisky with no sharp edges big chewy sherry oak flavour with smoked gammon saltiness fifty twentyfive great i found this dram a very strange experience for me there was a strange almost ribena like blackcurrant undertone throughout which made it pretty unpleasant i can definitely see why some people would enjoy this style of pour but this one was not for me  i wanted to like this but its a cynical offering sort of a middle ground malt there are much better similarly styled whiskys that cost less the coffee and chocolate flavors are cliched in this drink i am afraid i am off bowmore on the strength of a couple very average bottles  its good actually its very good quit a lot going on raisin sweetness combined with a bit of peat some gentle smoke nice oily mouthfeel it tastes like a 15 year old needs to settle down in the glass for a bit to get the best from it  sheer heavenly bliss for a north endukrainian from winnipeg manitobacanada unfortunate in this province we must pay through the nose for our libation bow ore is worth it  i really like sherry casked and finished scotches and i recently started drinking peated scotches i love the smoke in a good peated scotch this scotch is very sherry forward in the nose and the palate with a smoky peated finish the best of both in my opinion i took off one star for the chill filtering and the added color  i can 39 t drink macallan the overly sherried whiskey reeks of rotten egg to me this is delightful on the palate and a lovely dram but the nose still has that heavily sherried and slightly off putting albeit nowhere near the macallans the smoke is quite subtle and i could drink this but prefer others on the plus side the sherry finish means it lacks the medicinal tones of laphroaig and lagavulin which is a huge boon  i didn 39 t get the chance to try the original darkest so have no comparison reeference but i do like lediag 10 amp this has the same peat profile but is heavely sherried smoke is bold peat is there but not as bold as some islay 39 s corinth rasins latte with toffee nut syrup sherry a midge of costal sea water on the finish or is it just the soft peat raising it 39 s head above the heavily sherried pallet water amp time to open up makes it sweeter amp as if you have sprinkeled coco powder on the latte with toffee nut syrup  if not a perfect marriage between smoke and sherry then at least a perfectly healthy one perfect for dark and chillt autumn and winter eveningssl 225 inte  i have quite a vast amount of scotch single malt at home adding up to a total of 46 bottles covering the full range of taste notes whiskeys might offer the bowmore 15 years remains one of my favourites among them a great balance between bourbon sherry and smoke that makes this dram a perfect go to whisky for any occasion i highly recommend this bottle  has a great smoky sherried delivery but the finish is flat the original quot darkest quot was a step up  for me this is a perfect dram something to always have in the cupboard great balance of sweetness spice and smoke really smooth  i find this a really nice smooth single malt with just enough smoke really enjoy it lovely everyday tipple almost finished this one so will stock up as soon as  overall great malt but better if its ncf and no e150a nose was pleasant delivery on the palate was great but finish was flat palate and finish improves with water  magnificent single malt probably the best at that price super sweet and smoky it 39 s amazingly complex and just leaves you wanting more  i buy this every christmas i think it 39 s that good and affordable in all the christmas gift shopping i like a lot of single malts mostly islay but i demand to get value for the bucks bowmore gives this and age statements i like arbeg laphroaig bowmore and bunnahanhain the others i don 39 t care for i like both bowmore 12 and 15 the travel retail 15 is also great  easy drinking and smooth with a little smoke pretty nice after or during a dinner but not very complex a bit flat on the palate in the peat sherry market this is better than kilchoman loch gorm but will not buy again e just tried a sample nothing complex all the elements are confused too short meeeh  if this is what used to be called the darkest that whisky used e150a coloring and is chill filtered i didn t particularly care for the old brand  pink lady bubble gum blood red dark sexy  nos to słodki aromat czekolady sk 243 ry trochę jabłek i torf oraz wędzone mięso te dymne aromaty nie są na pierwszym planie ale są tłem kt 243 re jest wyraźnie wyczuwalne od początku do końca nie ma wątpliwości że to islay trochę migdał 243 w i karmelu język słodka oleista finisz dym wychodzi

this used to be called 39 darkest 39 last year but now it has replaced the standard 15 y o expression and the word 39 darkest 39 has vanished from the packaging odd yet another whisky 39 created 39 to fit an imaginary gap in the market i do wish bowmore would get back to making decent whisky instead of dancing to the marketing department 39 s tune it is quite different to the 12 y o with a strong and out of character 39 captain morgan rum 39 taste and smell there is smoke but it 39 s weak and despite the 3 years in sherry casks it isn 39 t overly sherried either i guess cherry and chocolate and rum finish is very short most of the bottle will end up in my home made blend with an equal measure of ardmore cask strength to add depth and real smoke despite all these shortcomings it 39 s ok but i would not buy again  a big rich dram full of raisins and dark chocolate creamy and thick in the mouth smoke arrives late to the party an ever present in my collection  i 39 ve just done a tasting session with a few samples with some staples that i keep in my cupboard trying to decide what to add next the guest list included uigeadailcorryvreckanlagavulin 16laphroaig 1 4 casklaphroaig 10talisker 10ardbeg 10big peatbowmore 12bowmore 15i 39 ll start by stating that the oogie and corry occupy a special place so they 39 re in likewise the standard 10 by ardbeg as it 39 s just so well rounded the bowmore 12 didn 39 t excite me at all close to bottom of this group for me but this 15 wow what a complexity of flavours that is simply absent from the 12 i preferred it to talisker 10 and put it next to the laphroaig for interest though it 39 s quite different there 39 s several seams of fruity flavours that sits alongside the peat and smoke cherries and coffee jumping out to me that 39 s presumably the sherry casks shining through my islay cabinet will definitely include this it offers something quite different and equally intriguing as the other menbers top stuff  not on the ardbeg level not as complex but is still very lovely dram especially for the price i wish finish was longer  bowmore is one of those distilleries that did not impress me with any of their cheaper younger stuff but when i spend a few extra bucks they always really impress me this is no exception i paid 85 but damn it really is that good all the same peat peach vanilla epic ness of the 10 year old cask strength tempest in the uk dorus mor in the us but with so much raisin and cherry and cinnamon apple and so smooth this is really a one of a kind whisky for me right now never had anything quite like it only reason it doesn 39 t get a 10 is because it 39 s only 43 i think at cask strength this could be one of the all time greats still totally awesome and worth the money cheers the sugarbear the 3 years as opposed to 3 months or so finishing in sherry casks does wonders for my palate every dram is equal and distinct im in love with this expression  magnificent whisky sweet on the nose and the palate beautiful raisin coffee and chocolate aromas along with a little bit of peat smoke much less than other bowmore expressions in my opinon it is the best bowmore in the core range the 12 years old is the whisky that is responsible for the start of my journey in the spirit world it is pretty good i tasted the 18 years old which i found to be too similar to the 12 to justify the price tag overall i 39 d stay that bowmore 15 darkest is one of the best bottles i own and i ever tested along with lagavulin 16 and talisker 10 will definitely drink again i recommend buying it  a nice balanced dram with interesting flavours not usually a bowmore fan but this is worth a look  it may not exactly be a masterpiece but darkest is a good reliable solid single malt which can be found anywhere in the world to me it possesses a little more character than the standard bowmore having a sweet entry and a surprising very subtle coffee chocolate like finish its balance sets it apart from other standard offerings making it perhaps a good entry offering for those not fond of being kicked in the face by peatiness  this whiskey is simply delicious i disagree with the review below saying it is flat on the palate i found the exact opposite to be true very complex flavours for me but everyone is different i normally drink ardbeg laphroaig and caol ila but this is going to be a permanent fixture on my shelf from now on  this whiskey is simply delicious i disagree with the review below saying it is flat on the palate i found the exact opposite to be true very complex flavours for me but everyone is different i normally drink ardbeg laphroaig and caol ila but this is going to be a permanent fixture on my shelf from now on  presentation the bottle has squarer sides and shoulders to your typical whisky bottle and the clear glass allows the natural deep colour of the whisky to star the label is nothing fancy with some info about the distillery embossed into the glass beneath it it is hard to confuse a bowmore bottle for any other appearance deep copper orange in colour a dead giveaway of the long sherry cask finish no need to add caramel colouring but it is no doubt chill filtered to preserve a clear finish aroma there is a little smoke but not as much as you would expect from a peated islay malt or even a younger bowmore strong sherry notes and accompanying aromas of holiday desserts like christmas pudding cream raisins and bitter dark chocolate flavour a little spice with well integrated smoke the peat does not overpower the whisky but instead blends expertly with the sherry flavours to create a smooth pleasant taste finish long with fading spice would i buy it again yes this is a superb whisky and great example of a sherry finish that is complimented by a little peat smoke rather than being overpowered by it as with most sherried whiskies the bowmore 15 year old darkest is a great way to finish the day and the modest 43 abv makes it quite palatable without dilution for the majority of drinkers whiskydad i recently reviewed this whisky since my last tasting in 2014 before it was rather chewy and chocolately i do find the peat is still there and quite dominant but the finish is rather thin now i would definitely still buy it and recommend but it has been downgraded  this is one of my favourite dark whiskies smells like an oakwood fire palate is sweet sherry followed by a woody smoke tastes like a warm wood fire in my parents rural scottish house divine  it 39 s fun to taste this whisky it has a complex nose that smells consistently of spicy wood its a soft pepper wood smell with some smoke that includes a bit of a syrupy sticky sweetness which at times reminded of toasted marshmallow as i finished the glass i smelled very distinct aromas of burnt paper so an interesting nose but the palate was watery in terms of taste i give it a 6 very smooth esp for a 15yo not offensive in anyway but not wholly appetizing either finish was a little thin some chocolate smoke stickiness  i like it reading the reviews only serves to prove that scotch whisky is totally completely utterly a personal thing one man 39 s meat blah blah and any suggestion that because you particularly love one whisky or even one area that anything else is somehow inferior is just risible your opinions are just that opinions to say that single malt x is not as good as single malt y because prefix it with quot in my opinion quot and we 39 ll all be more willing to listen i really do appreciate those reviews that outline the qualities and unique aspects of each whisky but for someone to tell me that something is inferior to something else just because he or she doesn 39 t like it well a bit arrogant  lots of flavour but peters out too quickly not my cup of tea mifune collingwood  lagavulin distillers edition is one of my favourite whiskies this is a very similar dram at 163 20 less so outstanding value not exactly the same i 39 d say the sherry in this is a bit more forward and with a little less medicinal peaty iodine tang but very similar and equally enjoyable in its own right  sweet and bowmore smoky lovely best i 39 ve tried like i just tasted the earth of the old country  it 39 s nice but let 39 s not forget that dark color sells whisky so i understand it from a marketing perspective 39 d love to see bowmore take leadership on islay for a back to the basics approach less sherry and no artificial colorings on islay love to see a quot seaside offering quot with max iodine this is a good whisky but they are trying too hard for the color from the sherry casks  a disappointment after tasting both 12 and 18 i gotta say both of them are better then this i think this one have more peat which i like but i don 39 t think the peat fits with the other tastes of this whiskey tyv 228 rr den s 228 msta whiskyn utav bowmore jag smakat d 229 dess starka r 246 ksmak inte g 229 r ihop med dess andra smaker

raisins and peat and salted butter in that order i wish the finish was longer and with more iodine like the 12 yr personal preference but i like the oily and iodine and medicinal for a 15 i expected more wow reminds me a little of a macallan 12 with peat  if you like to keep an open mind on different drams this will not disappoint if your a islay person or a speyside guy even a highland or lowland kinda person it offers something to everybody mentioned is it an ardbeg no is it a glenfarclas no is it a ancnoc 16 no my point being is that everybody has their one trick ponies that they go to because they do exactly what is stated on the tin what they are known for but if you want to have something that can do all of them and do it reasonably decent then this is it it has your peat and smoke it has fruit sweetness and sherry it has malt and oak everything really to please all and does it good an all round good jack of all trades lovely  i have been drinking the lagavulin 16 for a while now and i found it difficult to appreciate another peated whisky as i liked the lagavulin but i finally found something comparable i cant say its quot better quot but it 39 s definitely quot comparable quot lagavulin as the quot explosive peated bbq sauce punch quot and the bowmore darkest as a quot sweeter sauce quot effect on the pallet overall its true that there is still a gap of quality and complexity between these two bottles but its still a cheaper and sweeter version of the lagavulin and to be honest i found that lagavulin quality is dropping over past years which is the opposite of bowmore in conclusion you wont throw your lagavulin away for this one but its worth giving it a try and depending of what you are looking for powerful or sweeter you should probably appreciate this bottle  superb balance well maybe erring alittle on the sweet side a looooong finish with hints of sea salt and toffee quot slightly quot less oily than lagavulin and less money my new house whiskey  in response to quot the whore of islay quot it is true this one is considerably sweeter than most islays but my cabinet has space for many different whiskies sometimes i want it dry peaty and smoky sometimes i want it full and sweet to swirl and sip if i should feel dirty about buying this delightful whisky then let it be so sometimes it is fun to feel dirty  wonderfully sherried and perfectly smoked smooth from start to finish from a neat pour the nose lends beautiful peat smoke wet earth campfire ash and salty coastal notes after it opened up sweeter notes like pumpkin pie and golden raisins came thru the palate is silky with hints of salted butter wood and smoke the finish is relatively short but it is best described as spiced caramel with a wonderful transition back to the coastal saltiness and smoke i didn 39 t care for the bowmore 12 as it 39 s heavy iodine antiseptic sterile notes were too much for me however while some may disagree the longer aging and sherry casks makes this a well balanced peated islay malt if you 39 re not into heavy peat and prefer more sherry notes this is the perfect way to test the waters grab a sample from the chaps at master of malt  this isn 39 t bad but for an islay it 39 s totally an islay dressed up in a sherry finish with distillers suppressing her smokey origins it 39 s actually not bad as a drink for those who aren 39 t particular but for those who care you should feel a little dirty buying this one  the sherry cask finish makes this the best of the bowmore collection  perfect blend of smoke and sweet a very smooth whisky seamless transition from the nose to palate finishing with a spicy kick at the end  sherried smoked drenched treacle toffee superb autumn amp winter whisky good match for lagavulin 16 joint top of the tree for sherried islay whiskies  great whisky lovely sumptuous moorish notes nose of lush fruit raisin rum and heath bars sherry citrus and wood spices come through with peat embers that linger on the finish how could you not appreciate this  one cannot in any way compare this with lagavulin this is basically one more boring overpriced whiskey move on  for the price this one is fantastic  i was disappointed after reading the reviews on this weak spices and lacked the oily syrup finish described at this price far too pricey there is a mild sulphur after taste average quality which should be reflected in the price  not a bad whisky but for this price i think there a better drams out there unless you really love that unique bowmore character get a sample and move on  i was expecting a bit more from this compared to other smoked whisky of islay however still stands quite good to me gp completly awsome compared to the bowmore 12 yo which is horrible whereas bowmore 15 will not necessarily make your eyes water upon first swill like lagavulin with its almost overly robust peaty taste it bowmore does deliver a smoother more velvet like slower after burn that lingers on the palate i thoroughly enjoy the rough hewn experience of lagavulin in the winter nothing else warms and satisfies like it i enjoy it and any good islay single malt for the same reasons my wife and i enjoy a very hardy cabernet a libation can t be too robust given a chill in the air that said i ve grown weary of chasing the increasingly over bid price of lagavulin 16 and the abject mishandling of the supply by the distillery which was probably by design to drive up the pricing so following the counsel of the dining room manager at my club i tried bowmore 15 as a viable substitute come rival of lagavulin and i ve not been disappointed it s a good islay single malt worth the modest increase in price and as with most single malts it couples well with a good cigar cheers  sick of spending 100 00 plus on bottles of lagavulin try bowmore darkest i was looking for a cheaper alternative and i want to tell you this really gives the more expensive lagavulin 16 a run for its money depending on your taste it s as good or better definitely a smoother finish you just can t go wrong here  my first impression of this was not great as i thought the sherry character was quite aggressive but now i ve familiarised myself with it i think this is a superb whisky there is plenty of smoke up front then the wonderfully rich body takes over then the smoke returns for the finish it s quite unlike anything i ve had before huge flavour and complexity brilliant  the notorious smoked apple juice theme meets sickeningly sweet sherried malt what a horror show i ll stay with other islay malts  smoking cedar plum and clove the aroma adds very dark chocolate candy with toffee vanilla and cinnamon the palate adds sour cherry a very complex melange that delights the senses especially at cooler temperature  that s right a spice and fiery number until the flames calm down to singed orange peel dense fruitcake and burned bonfire toffee a dangerous night on a scottish hillside bursts with flames of bracken not to be trifled with until the clinkers cool ash and spread with molasses ending as currants coated with caramel  nice smoked and woody whisky i also love the colour a lot although i find it a little to pricy for what it is  win  just one thing to say just lovely 
2017.0, brown forman is going more of the diageo route with glendronach the scotch is a shell of its former self and master blender rachel barrie ain 39 t no billy walker it is a descent scotch and amongst the better entry level whiskies avialable however it misses the depth of flavor from earlier editions yet still close to my favorite entry level whiskies the only thing really consistent about this 12yo core range is that quality has been inconsistent but also gradually gone downhill in its defense it is still bottled at 43 abv non chillfiltered and non colored but nowhere near the quality and flavor billy walker and his team delivered just compare the depth of flavor nose and natural color of an older bottling drawn from fresher sherry casks to these newer ones and you 39 ll see how pale in color and flavor it has become due to the use of dull 5th refill sherry casks reminds me a bit of the lesser 12yo glenfarlcas bottles that contained some type of sour curry off note due to the use of exhausted refill casks and often contaminated with sulphur they seemed to have fixed it over there at quot farclas quot mostly and i may even prefer a glenfarclas 12 yo over a glendronach 12 yo these days but it wasn 39 t always that way truly independent distilleries who have mutual respect for their supporters and who don 39 t try to sell you watered down artificially colored moonshine are getting rare folks so i 39 ll give brown forman credit for not completely watering down glendronach just yet and staying true to the 43 ncf uncolored standard of presentation that billy walker set the deep old school macallan sherry style influence that set them apart they lost that though with these duller 5th or something refill casks like i said glenfarclas is the one people sleep on now  this is a honest basic sherry whisky which always was and still is in the front row of my whisky cabinet there are slight variations of the bottlings my last one of 2020 just needs some air still recommended especially for 31 euros i stocked up after the recent owner the us brown forman cooperation seems to have decided to chill filter and will probably dilute it down to 40 abv what a shame 4 now zero for the future plans  always in my pantry delicious sherried goodness have heard that it is going to get chill filtration and the addition of caramel circa 2021 so i have just bought a case  having gone through 3 bottles of the 2019 batch which had become my favourite tipple the 2020 bottling is very disappointing  more flavorful than aberlour 12 or balvinie 12 we all have our preferences but i 39 d say get this over those  sherry bomb amp it is good though rivals the taste of macallan 12 at 20 bucks less well worth it and not to dog on macallan 12 which is excellent its just more expensivd because of the name recognition which again isnt a bad thing but if youre looking to save money go with glendronach 12  really fantastic sherry cask dram great value for your money  gorgeous whisky has to be one of my favourites really a nice sweet and smooth sherry cask dram lots of nuances great quality vs price  rich caramel hints of nuts and slight fruit and florals glencairn horizontal on the nose with glencairn verticle caramel on top malted barley under rim nutty oaky and spicy on bottom third with a hint of smoke flavor starts spicy moves into oaky and then nutty finishes sweet with fruits and florals  average scotch i 39 d say it 39 s not bad but it 39 s nothing special for me either maybe i 39 m not ready for it yet  this is no nonsense stuff you can definitely taste the whisky behind the sherry the whisky is clean and a bit sharp with a bitter drinness that probably results in the quot match quot tasting note i feel the distillation shares a lot in common with royal lochnagar on top there is a well integrated sweetness most apparent in the nose not overdone or artificial it serves to soften quot an honest dram quot rather than overwhelm it this does not drink like a mass market whisky its neither refined nor tamed enough for that instead it is whisky made for those who have quot done quot the usual suspects and have decided to explore is it a classic at this point i 39 m not sure but while i have been writing this review i have been chewing the aftertaste of my last sip i think the only thing this whisky needs is a bit more time in the barrel and that isn 39 t a bad thing tried a number but this has to be my new go to my new favourite first sherry normally a laguvulin 16 seems rougher than laguvulin not as smooth not bad but not for my taste  nice nothing extra just a smooth scotch one that will bring you back again ml maine a lot sherry unfortunately also some sulphur pretty nice but not in the same league as macallan 12 glenfarclas 12 is a better buy as well e superb dram and finally the one which both my husband and i can both enjoy i 39 m a peat head and he likes japanese whisky but this is definitely a meeting in the middle very fruity and complex with just a hint of smoke a truly beautiful malt  one of the best of 12 years such better than macallan 12 sherry bomb glendronach 12 gt mac allan 12 gt aberlour 12 gt glenfarclas 12 not generally a fan of sherried whiskies much prefer islay amp the islands however this is a very enjoyable dram didn 39 t find it too sweet very easy to drink although not much going on 4 5 yeah enjoyed this had it last night full of flavour very sweet but a nice caramelised sugar sort or smell taste finish is good aswell yeah for the price id say pick this up i have always liked the macallan sherry cask 12 yr old i have tried and enjoyed the glendronach 15 yr old revival for the money this 12 yr old glendronach is an absolute beauty certainly better than the eqivulant balvenie imho wanted to love this but it 39 s just missing something a little empty and a short finish not wowed very smooth yet fruitful matured and very easy to drink beautiful sweet fruity nose and reasonably complex sweet fruity palate succesful maturation in active casks what some call quot smooth quot in an unspecific way i guess px casks add a good depth and supplements the oloroso beautifully good blending of casks its not going to scare novices and theres enough here for experienced malt mates to enjoy maybe what others call quot easy to drink quot cask quality appears to be a bit above what is currently average not sure if its sherry seasoned or matured casks or a mix perhaps comparable to current springbank wet sherry cask quality no traces of charcoally reconditioned cask flavor basically quality all around spirit influence is mild and pleasant i choose this over macallan where prices are offensive compared to what you get here the quality does the marketing i feel good buying this and will do it again  been drinking this for a long time have yet to find anything to match it a fabulous tipple drank neat  before i tried this my favorites where chivas regal 18 and glenfiddich 15 this scotch beats everything i ve had so far granted i haven t had a ton but this is worth a try  one of the best whiskey i ever had very oily and smooth definitely a sherried whisky the nose is sugar and nuts palate is raisins nuts and a little apple finish is medium with nuts and a hint of smoke a word of warning go very light on the water with this whisky because the palate becomes too dilute it 39 s one of the few i drink neat  my husbands favourite tipple always a warming little treat on a cold day after golf  lovely single malt i paid 163 34 on amazon and will definitely be buying again its far superior to the 12 year old aberlour in every way although it is 163 10 more but worth every extra penny its a sherry bomb on the nose and on the palate i find it very oily and it covers my mouth really well to distribute the flavour this is the best mouth feel of all 30 odd whiskeys ive tried so far it has a typical rich dark fruity sherried taste to start off and tails off into malty and coffee flavours for me i give it a slight edge over the balvenie double wood but its very close and i wouldn 39 t be 100 on that definitely recommend this single malt  got a bottle after some reading and recommendations certainly not disappointed some richness and depth without feeling heavy a word of caution after adding water to my glass only a teaspoon all those cask notes disappeared which makes me beg for a 46 abv enjoy this neat  forget all the nuts raisins apples and spices aroma suffice it to say that the complex aromatics will remind you of the smell of nanny 39 s kid leather gloves or your first girlfriend 39 s hair if you want it to what 39 s important is the taste and this is a good old fashioned sherried whisky like they used to make it like the macallan used to be before they cheaped out on their storage casks or highland park before they did the same and started claiming some nonexistent viking heritage it 39 s whisky guys get over yourselves in my book it falls into two broad categories drinkable or burn your throat nasty this glendronach definitely falls into the first category and then some single malt whisky the way it used to be made and proof that it can still be made that way what more could one want  absolutely gorgeous i 39 ve always thought of myself as an islay man but this pulling me further east  i am not really in these sherry whisky i actually do not understand why so many people love that since it taste a kind of a mix between whisky and porto anyway a friend of mine promessed me this one is not too sherry and is so well balanced i should like it i have to admit it is well balanced and quiet good a nice creamy spicyness very warm in the throat long finish always to sherry for my taste but if you like that juste buy it  i find that most whiskies that depend quite heavily on sherry butts are a bit one note not here glendronach 12 has a fantastic depth and a richness that makes it a stand out for me i 39 ll take this dram any day over so many other bottles try it you won 39 t be sorry  my second cherried whisky and my second whisky disappointment nose is nice though a bit simple but the taste is just bitterness and nothing else  a beautiful sherry expression from this excellent distillery and a real good buy at just under 163 40 for a 12yo ncf natural colour whisky i 39 ve taken half a point off because i would prefer 46 to the 43 a very minor quibble this is a well balanced exceedingly smooth dram with an enticing nose lovely mouth feel and a long sherried finish i 39 ve had several bottles previously and this one wont be my last  despite the reviews and warnings this doesn 39 t wear its sherry cask on its sleeve lovely subtle nose to start without being too figgy or raisin y gentle long finish some vanilla and banana flavours around the edges and just enough heather a bit of cedar too some sherried offerings have an unbalanced oak edge but all is kept in check here nicely done i wouldn 39 t take it with a cigar again but a good bottle will stick with my tomatin 12 or arran 14 for the times when a real sherry voice is needed but this was still a great bottle  best malt ever been enjoying it for years christmas in a bottle this is a wonderful whisky a rich warm dram for a cold dark night or a treat on the pallet for the rest of the year i ll be back  definitely one of the best in this price range  for once i agree with jim murray on a sherried malt this is stunning and i 39 m a peat monster fan stupendous nose and initial palate of just about every fruit and sweet thing you 39 d find in a cookie jar so much going on i 39 m comparing it to glenfarclas 12 and there is no comparison sorry jim but you 39 re wrong on that one finish is medium and wonderfully complex the whole thing is just so vibrant i 39 m even getting cocoa in the finish a hint ever so subtle of a bit of smoke amongst all the vanilla cherries peach slices raisins dark chocolate to name just a few buy it again you bet this and a 39 bundah are the two absolutely must have sherry finished malts for me  having tasted a few drams this was actually a pleasant find beautiful sherried malt i like to try drams with a drop of water chocolate or oatcakes this was complemented i found with dark chocolate  if you dont like glendronach either you are a peat head or just plain silly fantastic stuff let it breathe abit and enjoy its amazing character  sweet and flavorful like all glendronach expressions non chill filtered no added color pretty good for 43 percent abv  lovely dram all about the sweet apple pie on the palate smooth finish perfect at 43  lovely malt worth the money  my go to whisky  it 39 s really good one of the best non caskstrength sherrycasks i 39 ve ever had  love this whisky but dismayed by the recent price increase in new york it 39 s impossible to find it under 70 has anyone else noticed a similar jump in price  legit smoother than mccallan 12 but with similar notes  moderately complex very viscous good lasting heat on the back of the tongue one of the sweeter single malts a good dram for the uninitiated to try 73 95 can at the lcbo in ontario been waiting a while to try something from this distillery since most of what they offer is a bit pricey here in california but got this as a christmas gift and i 39 m really impressed with this one of my new favorite sherried whiskys for sure loads of dark fruit creamy vanilla pudding honey and a hint of smoky chocolate incredibly smooth and flavorful i gotta save up and try the 15 year this stuff is delicious cheers the sugarbear this is my first experience with a true single malt scotch whisky and although i have no baseline to compare it to other than irish and american whiskeys i am thoroughly pleased and enjoying it immensely i have yet to develop the knowledge or skills to discern the subtleties of this particular spirit but i have enjoyed it i find that a little experimentation with resting times and a few drops of water delivers a different experience with every dram there is an obvious sweetness and what i guess is a creaminess to the finish perhaps an attribute of the sherry maturation no hint of smoke or salt that i can detect a hint of banana as others have noted although not a raw banana more of a banana cream no harshness or burn to the finish just a soothing gentle fade away it is a whisky that will satisfy a novice 39 s curiosity but not scare them off with an overly complex delivery and experience i imagine experienced quot malties quot will also appreciate the pureness of the sherry overtones in a relatively inexpensive caramel free non cold filtered spirit selling for about 50 usd  what a dram and the price makes me smile this is damn good  high viscosity legs very slow oily nose very sweet heavily sherried carmelised sugars dried fruit spicey orange marmalade if left to air for 30mins or more cereal comes through palate sweetly sugary sherry fruit orange marmalade honey spicey finish medium sherry orange fruity spicey  a fine dram this really is a fantastic whisky and you wouldn 39 t go wrong with a bottle of this i personally prefer the 21 however for the price this really delivers  first dram from the bottle is a cherry bomb almost too simple give it time as you finish the bottle and more complex flavors should reveal themselves i wasn 39 t sure if i 39 d like it at first but as i took a few months to finish the bottle i became a fan  when i first opened it i was bombed with stewed fruits very sherried however i let the bottle sit for a few months before i finished it i definitely enjoyed it more near the end maybe my palate adjusted but i was able to detect more complex flavors definitely going to try another bottle  the taste of this whisky has changed remember that glendronach mothballed its distillery from 1996 2002 the post 2014 bottlings truly are 12 year old whiskies if you bought this glendronach 12 bottled in 2013 you were getting a 17 year old whisky as the whisky was distilled and casked in 1996 those who enjoyed the amazing glendronach 12 from 2010 2013 were getting a whisky older than the stated age that is no longer the case it is still a great 12 year old whisky it 39 s just not the value that it once was  to the comment below mine it could be the oxidation process inside an open bottle either way this is marvelous bang for your buck if you favor a whisky that tastes not unlike a good kompot  i used to like this a lot but i don 39 t know if my taste changed or whether this whisky got a lot less good as it stands i would not recommend it  surprising amount of heat sherry sits back in my opinion theres sweetness but it 39 s balance great price point and good entry level dram a good whiskey i prefer the benriach sherry cask 12 or 15 year which is a tiny bit more expensive but this is still a good quality drop  this is an excellent sherried scotch and one of the best values in the 12 year range not as good as the 15 year old revival but pretty close in my opinion it blows away the macallan 12 and even rivals the mac 18 sherry oak  they haven 39 t had time to build up their reputation i also suspect their whisky might not get as much critical acclaim because it is very heavily sherried and for one thing that segment is overcrowded if there ever was one for another judges tend to subtract points if the whisky takes over too much of the qualities of the wine sherry bourbon or whatever resided in the cask before but to the point what i found most remarkable in this dram is that the nose displays a scent very much reminiscent of a well sorted vine cellar that amalgamation of noble rot maturing wine and a slight dampness it 39 s definitely there to the taste it is fruity and you could be forgiven to think it had a wine finish instead of sherry nevertheless it is very enjoyable and a huge bargain if you ask me  i 39 ve bought the miniature set after my distillery visit and have done a vertical tasting of 12yo original 15yo revival 18yo allardice 21yo parliament if you taste them one after the other you would actually be inclined to rate the 12yo slightly lower because the older expressions are truly genuinely excellent and the youngest one pales a bit in comparison but then you have to remember this is an almost entry level expression and very reasonably priced to be perfectly honest i can 39 t fathom how glendronach could be this cheap and low profile as it is easily up there with the likes of dalmore glenmorangie dare i say close to macallan as well i only have the following two guesses perhaps because the distillery has reopened a few years ago they haven 39 t had time orange peel rum and cherries on the nose and tongue some heat and rum raisin trail this pleasant single malt scotch whisky throughout the oloroso sherry is talking to ya wonderful  i had this in the whiskey christmas advent and really enjoyed it i being a sherry finish fan am sure to add this to my personal bar  i can 39 t speak for the newest 2015 bottling but the 2014 examples i bought a second bottle before i even finished the first were simply fantastic this is a true sherry bomb and in my opinion is superior to my benchmark mac 12 the nose is simply incredible dark sherry with a background of late fall fireside smoke caramel and walnuts the body is full of sherry fruit and oaky vanilla with a hint of honey and smoke the finish is candied sweets toffee and a bit more smoke right at the end of the finish seriously fabulous stuff for a nosing glass and an hour of sipping per dram tastes like every good holiday memory you 39 ve ever had  i have had this whisky before and i have liked it for whatever reason the dram i received was virtually straight ethanol no matter how hard i tried to like it it burned its way in the scent of vanilla grew as it opened up and i added a little water when sipped it hinted at some fruit but mostly it just burned i added water and more fruit came out but even after waiting an hour it still simply burned absolutely no cream spice or butter to this just raw alcohol disappointing i always have wondered if the top of a bottle may taste different sometimes and i would be willing to give this one a go again but not on my dollar i have been told that this grows on you with time and i 39 m open to that but maybe some other time final note i am doing the 2015 advent calendar as a result i get one drink at it to decide if i like it enough to buy more sometimes i need to drink something three or four times to make up my mind thus my rating is based on a one time drink experience  i 39 ve really come to love this stuff agree with one of the earlier reviews of it needing some time first 1 3 or more of the bottle it was just ok a bit congested but after that it has opened up very nicely brown sugar toffee sweetness but not overly so nutty some red fruits raspberry dried fruits raisin prune white pepper and wood spice cherry coke and a touch of chocolate in the finish  full bodied cherried malt with tones of brown sugar and oak wood lovely stuff  fantastic sherry price quality fit 39 in the hell are youse gowks on aboot aspartame for you widna ken yer erse fae yer elbow whaur whisky 39 s concerned  not sure where to begin on this scotch nose is what you would expect from a sherried single malt however the first sip is where it went downhill very fast cloying sweetness with the overwhelming taste of aspartame hits you and sticks in your mouth i even had trouble wanting to swallow it to be honest you get a tiny hit of caramel and a slight toffee ish taste but boy the fake sweetener kills it totally finish was very bland and short a massive let down for me as i had been wanting to try this for some time guys for the money you can pay maybe 5 to 10 more and get a much better scotch needless to say i will go back to my doublewood or aberlour 12 or shucks even my mac 12 hell even a sip on some j amp b would blow this out the water awful just awful wauw this is the first time that i can 39 t praise a product from glendronach the nose is okay pretty linear though the initial impression on the palate is quite alright and goes down with ease but after swallowing finish horrible paramounting taste of artificial sweetener not saying that s whats in it totally ruins the dram a sickening sweetness could 39 nt finish my glass  a very nice whisky caramel and toffee a little maple syrup very heavily sherried i almost never use water but this one needs a dash to settle it some the price is certainly right but for nearly the same price i would choose highland park 12 any day still a good dram  2015 bottling extraordinarily balanced i 39 ve a preference for older single malts but this 12 year old truly realizes the potential of its class heavily sherried yet the lovely imparts of p x and oloroso casks do not drown out the very high quality of this single malt attention to detail is evident well refined and full of character at 43 this is one for the connoisseurs  this isn 39 t a bottle you reach for on a special occaision this is the bottle you reach for on week nights when you just want something nice to sip while watching netflix it 39 s a great expression of the style for a very good price i think you 39 ll find it disappears pretty damned quickly  overall a reasonably complex and finely sherried single malt but this one needs some time to quot air out quot and breathe a bit the first few glasses from my current bottle seemed a bit harsher than some of the glendronach whiskies i 39 ve had in past years the finish initially had a rather unpleasant smoke character akin to sucking on a charcoal briquette after drinking the bottle down to the top of the label and letting it rest for a week or so the charcoal aftertaste noticeably diminishes and the real character of this whisky really shines through with its fruity sherry flavors if you like sherried whisky give this one a try  it 39 s okay i don 39 t think its exceptional nor i do think it is that smooth the finish was a bit rough would i serve it to guests sure but i don 39 t think it would get 5 stars in fact i might just have talked myself into going to the abc store and getting some glenfiddich 12  this is smooth and gentle scotch the kind that non scotch drinkers can enjoy you can definitely taste sherry wine and smell it however for me after drinking the most important part of a scotch is what i get when i breathe out my nose this scotch smells like a wet dish cloth i enjoy the initial flavor but the after taste smell is such that i can 39 t drink glendronach 12 fyi my favorite scotches glenmorangie 18 glengoyne 15 highland park any ardbeg auriverdes laguvulin 16 bowmore 18 very nice whisky if you are on the sweet side sherry infused with a smooth sweet and sour fruity taste i didn 39 t pick up any chocolate and hazelnuts like described above but i 39 m just a novice definitely a sweet toffee lingering finish worth the money  wifey picked it up for me she 39 s got good taste and so does this scotch smooth someone told me that due to the distillery closing from 96 til 2002 all the whisky that is marked 12 year old is actually 17 or 18 year old as none was produced til march spril 2002 so by that logic this is a v good value 18 year old if bottled in jan 2014 its a nice story anyway and a lovely drop  i am personally a fan of the peaty smokey stuff but sometimes i love a smooth dram i have purchased this as a gift we cracked it open at a friend s house and tried it out he runs into the dining room brings out a new decanter with a little balvenie 17 in it pours us two good size drams and says this is going into the decanter brought another bottle to a bachelor party and everyone including the non scotch fans commented about how smooth it is if there is a perfect daily dram especially with a nice italian meal this is it and it 55 us you can t beat it i highly recommend it to rookies sophomores and veterans of single malts  no peat what so ever almost sweet syrupy if it were wine i say it was corked very disappointing i m going back to oban amp dalwhinney even singleton  my favourite whisky so far absolutely wonderful this is why i like whisky great quality for a good prize i will surely buy another bottle i can t wait to try the 15yo  the first couple of glasses were a little rough around the edges with clear notes of maple syrup as the whisky has mellowed since i opened it a few months ago the sweetness has become more powerful with strong brown sugar notes on the nose transitioning to a much crisper syrupy body definitely hits the sweet tooth  in a perfect world this expression is what every scotch single malt should be like this release is why i drink whisky  plain and simple comment here great sweet smooth sherry infused whiskey tastes very nice great for the collection and wonderful for new whiskey lovers enjoy my friends  i taste a bit of peat hidden somewhere mixed with in the fruit flavors not too sweet good length finish nice grainy bite  a wonderful sherry malt super sweet very rich if you want to suggest glenlivet 12 or the glenfiddich consider suggestion this one a great intro scotch and a great light rich dram  very drinkable sherried dram go for the gelndronach 15 year which is much more intense it has been a long time since i had a glendronach last time in 75cl bottle and it is just as delightful as i remembered definitely going to order some more  i love this sherried speysider i have yet to taste a better 12 year old of this style imo better than aberlour 12 and macallan gold it s just a pity that mom have added an extra 163 5 to the price since i last bought it  after being a long time fan of macallan but sorely disappointed with the last few bottles of their sherried offerings i ve had i decided it was time for a change tried a dram of this and ordered two bottles looking forward to a bit over fire side sipping over christmas  whilst not going to threaten the whiskey podium this is a lovely lovely whiskey a fan of sherried and port finishes this is one of the better ones jason breen a go to scotch for me nice value for the buck heavy sherry with a raisiny christmas pudding thing going on some toffee and spice with a medium long finish no peat yeah a touch better than the macallan 12 for me  nice stuff definate must have medium to heavy sherry influence nutty and christmas cake taste touch of chocolate and peat awesome stuff and a must have love it to the max  i agree with all the comments this is a good whisky to drink sweet but not too sweet nice after taste too would i buy another bottle yes i bought the 12 and 15 revival i would suggest the 15 revival for a few more  a great choice for an everyday sipper for the sherry scotch fan awesome fruity nose big flavor and lasting finish 3 and a half stars maybe 4  quality stuff for fans of sherry monster scotch fans big interesting nose and a full creamy mouthfeel i will have one in the cabinet at all times when the mood strikes  enjoyed it very much great sherried whisky with a little punch a nice desert  at the moment number one for me  this is beautiful the sherry leaves a lovely aftertaste and makes you want ot get stuck into this amazing world of single malts even more  very drinkable quite complex nose with lots of well integrated sherry great palate giving a juicy sensation a bit like highland park with satysfying finish with a great quality for value i really recommend this dram 
14533.0, the glendronach 21 year old parliament 2020 25 year on the nose fruity dark fruit date vanilla ripe fruits apple orchard candied orange syrup toasty oak cereal honey sherry malty note palate spice slightly dry golden syrup fruity notes rich dark fruit plum nutmeg allspice raisin fantastic notes lovely sherry cask in oak cask sweet notes toffee nut meg cinnamon orange finish lever vanilla brown sugar very nice bottle of single malt onde of the best dram you can drink from monday to monday i love it 129347  great  was gifted a bottle forms my son and absolutely loved it bought another since if you love speyside whiskies and a rich depth of flavour you ll love this this is an incredible dram so rich and smooth with a lovely depth of flavour glendronach is my favourite distillery and this is the jewel in its crown it 39 s not cheap but absolutely worth the money my only issue is that i drink it far too quickly and nothing else tastes quite as good  lovely a very rewarding dram  this has to be the worst malt whisky i have ever had in fact think you would be better with a bottle of turps delicious i was given a bottle as a christmas present normally i would never drink such an expensive whisky but i have now tried it a few times well diluted with water it is a real treat with a mild character and a sweet aftertaste i finished a glass about 10 minutes ago and still have the gentle flavour in my mouth if i were rich i would drink this more often  this is not a bad dram if you can source it for around a ton it is a tasty drop full of flavour and pretty good for a commercial quality but then again for very similar money you could source a 22 y o single cask arran oloroso or a 16 y o highland park sherry finish or even a 22 y o tobermory sherry cask or a 22 y o spey side sherry cask each giving the farclas a run for the money and coming out on top but regardless this is still a very nice dram would definitely benefit from a slightly higher abv though 128077  very complex fruity dram by far my favourite from the glendronach range  waw what a nice sherry bomb you can enjoy every single sip this one totally is a sherry bomb very complex fruity rich sweetness it 39 s just a very great stuff that you can sit down and slowly enjoy every drop of it  this is some grade a juice in the past 50 years i have tasted some good whiskies i have sipped some excellent ones the parliament is easily in the top 3 wonderful scotch the only downer is that i can t buy it in the states i suppose that i m just going to have to come back over and stock up and hope that customs don t catch me  i bought it to try a outstanding scotch i am a glen dronach drinker this was an excellent purchase i had tasted none better  this scotch is very delicious with a lovely sherry aroma and taste it has a very long finish  the best 21 year old schotch i 39 ve been drinking i absolutley love it i 39 ve had aberfeldy glengoyne and balvenie 21 year old as well balvenie is the smoothest of them all but it also lack some in the taste it 39 s just really smooth but doesn 39 t taste that much i can 39 t remeber wich was the best one of aberfeldy and glengoyne but they 39 re match eachother pretty good you need some water to them both and they 39 re fruity whiskies this review will be about glendronach however and it 39 s a beast very much complexity alot of sherry but it doesn 39 t take over the whole whisky i like to add a drop of water but it will do fine drinking neat as well now i will enjoy this one cheers  this is a smooth and drinkable whisky which has richness and depth it 39 s one of my partner 39 s absolute favourites for its lovely smoothness and character  i am not a whiskey expert but this glendronach 21 parliament certainly tastes so so good i have a lady friend who does not drink whiskey except when she and her husband visit me for dinner she will always have glendronach 21 parliament with a big smile on her face i don 39 t know why but i find that the best taste is to let the whiskey reach room temperature in the glass swill it around and smelling the aroma every now and than the first sip is fabulous  perfect  very subtle and understated up until the finish where the oaky pepper kick abounds feels somewhat imbalanced and quite forgettable  frankly question the veracity of the 5 star reviews decent enough flavour but hidden behind far too much burn for a 163 100 bottle many many many better options out there accept better is a subjective term for a drink but really do believe this should rest down low in any bona fide lists of top likes 1 5 stars because of daft price for what you get  neil bates very pleased with this new purchase sub 163 100 one of my new favorite drams will definitely get another bottle to drink with captain bishty  wow a perfect balanced whisky sherry  this is the best from the range by a wide margin one of my favorites fantastic value fantastic single malt ralfy 39 s 2014 review is wrong this is a great dram classic speyside sherry character  this is a complex one with several unique tastes and bouquets just love it  for the price its hard to beat  the closest comparison i can think of is the macallan 18 sherry cask releases but good luck finding one of those this 21 is less than half the price of the more recent and pedestrian macallans it 39 s full of uniquely rich dried cherry notes it stands in a class by itself amongst the highland whiskeys truest excellent  all the glendronachs are very good if you like fruity spicy whisky the 21 had the most rich nuanced flavors it is well worth the price  i hummed and hawed for months about which fancy expensive scotch i wanted to buy myself as a present i compared this to the 18 year and couldn 39 t really tell the difference at first however after swishing some water around between the two i noticed this didn 39 t have the quot sting quot at the end like the 18 year did just pure delightful smoothness the challenge will be in forcing myself to not drink this every day  great scotch nice sweet flavor to compliment the scotch burn tastes of cinnamon fall fruits maple apple peels and some allspice or nutmeg with a very slight syrupy sweetness a great drinking scotch best time is early fall with a nice gurkha cigar  one of the best spirits i have ever tasted back up the truck and buy more because it is real easy to drink a truckload of this stuff and get sad about it i 39 ve had the 21 year and the 18 year glendronach both are fantastic spirits and worth your dollar but if you can only go with one get this event at a higher this is much more manageable do allow some time for the spirit to open up on your first pour  i can 39 t belive that it 39 s so wonderful taste for this price i love it i have to make a supply before price will increase  the most beautifully complex scotch at this age a splash of water opens this scotch up wonderfully floral and sweet  glendronach is known for its powerfully quot sherried quot drams and the 21 year old parliament is the king of the hill the only problem with the 21 year old is the 18 year old side by side many will miss the subtle differences i appreciate the extra three years as the power of the sherry casks really picks up in those last three years do yourself a favor pick these up while you can  bought as a gift for my father a whisky connoisseur described it a quot very very good quot which is high complement indeed as a non whisky drinker and only an intermediary i can pay high complements to master of malt for their consistent impeccable service  absolutely incredible i have many favorites highland park 18 glendronach 18 macallan 18 glenfarclas 25 and 21 dalmore 18 but this one is so amazing it is about as complex and perfect you could want a single malt to be five stars  having purchased the complete core expressions from glendronach i have absolutely fallen in love with this distillery the 12 year old and 18 year old exceptionally good whisky that said the huge sherry bomb of a 21 year old now sits atop my cabinet in a place of honor if you are a fan of quot sherried quot whisky i cannot name one that is better  my absolute favorite a sherry bomb of another world  absolutely lovely dram nothing else need be said  bought 2 of these on a whim a couple of months back opened one and pretty much drank the whole bottle during that week have recently purchased another 5 will probably get another 2 3 just in case  sherry bombs are my thing the bigger the better and you could tell that this one is a mature and sophisticated expression if you didnt know it was 21 yo upon first pouring and tasting straight away i though it a little harsher if thats the word than i expected so added just a little more water than the normal teaspoon and gave it 10 15mins to open up what a difference it made beautiful all the way from nose to finish amp hard to put down great buy  been at a whisky tasting was given some chocolate to go with it definitely worth a try i have the 12 15 and 18 year old expressions but after treating myself to this little beauty i think i found a my new favorite glendronach beautiful complexity matured in sherry casks to perfection compared to some of the other 21 year olds out there this is excellent value under 100 for this wow  my favorite to start 2017 for those who love sherry bomb whiskey i highly recommend  beautiful just beautiful the 15yr old is a lot intense and the 18yr allardice is smooth but this 21 yr old is even better the matured malt and the sherry cask provide what is a great dram hints of cinnamon dry fruits cake in a complex whisky savoury  one of my favorite bottles i bought 4 and the i tried to reorder 24 but they were sold out  one of the best malts i ever tried  this is just exquisitely delicious a beautiful complex mouth and superb finish that you want to savor slowly  the 12 year old was a favourite of ours but this happened in the way of a present and what a taste it is a really great whisky at a very reasonable price wish i could afford the barrel  as i 39 ve read due to the changing of hands of this distillery the 21 is actually several years older than that so it should be the best value out there it probably is i can see why people like this just to me this reminds me far too much of the proverbial fruitcake you 39 d get from your friendly neighbor on xmas eve don 39 t want to kill its reputation by rating it poorly especially as i find the distillery 39 s story endearing but it 39 ll be a while before i splurge for another one from these guys  this was a present for my 40th birthday from my much loved father in law we have always enjoyed the scottish malts yet never ventured into this price range well what a surprise the full body and complex nodes that accompany this beautifully crafted scotch took our minds into heaven it certainly will be savoured shared and replaced wow what a treat  leave it to decant and the scents become bewildering you 39 ll have acacia honey flowers fruits it 39 s a head massage for your nose the taste is mellow sweet soothing with a lingering long finish it is a mastery of flavours layers and depth you could say it belies it 39 s age even though at 21 it 39 s not a young whisky to start with in comparison a 19yo glentauchers is much more fiery i know that 39 s intended for the blending vats all in all it is not a dram to drink at a dinner party or while conversing this is for quiet solitude and savouring because you 39 ll want to concentrate on the delicate gentle pampering of your senses it 39 s a similar price to the balvenie 17 yo which is also a straight up corker this is a thoroughly different character and i think this is better value  an astounding surprise to me i vary between islay and speyside mostly but this blew my socks off loved the sweetness that double matured sherry cask brought to it  had a few drams in the grill bar aberdeen last night lovely lovely drop palate quot cherry blossom quot get a grip guys unless there are a few cherry blossom munchers in the team  this is probably one if the best scotches i have ever tasted i have enjoyed a wide variety of close to 200 different bottles and this one sticks out it smells inviting giving mentors of dates coffee chocolate some spices like vanilla and nutmeg and a wiff of smoke it elegantly coats your mouth like a light syrup and tastes of tootsie roll fudge some honeydew and cinnamon comes around caramel and chocolate are a definite friend here the finish is smooth and lasting with some smoke and espresso flavours and finishing with dark chocolate absolutely sublime where i live this bottle was on a limited release only and costing almost 150 i bought one for a special occasion withmy father as soon as we tried it when 39 re we had to go out and buy more immediately before it was all sold out i now own three and i can 39 t wait to drink them truely an amazing dram  purchased from loch fyne whisky shop i find very nice for this time of year lovely dark colour from the sherry definitely a sip and saver malt i will be back for more sp i needed to add a little water to this to calm down the heat are reveal more flavour the alcohol does make it very warm the tasting notes from mofm are spot on especially the very light smoke on the nose very pleasant and comforting the immediate taste is of baked oak and warm syrup with a long sherry and fruit finish it s is a slightly more complex taste than the revival 15 but i like both very much the revival 15 absolute bargain right now at 163 38 is perhaps more robust and easy drinking but the parliament is very nice indeed it s all down to personal taste and both are exceptionally good drams for the price glendronach is my current favourite distillery they are producing so much good whisky i feel very fortunate thank you to all who work there  i m not a fan of messing around malts with mixed cask finishes so this although a bit heavy and coarse is still simply a great malt and well worth what i paid for it at loch fyne whiskies 163 64 i m in agreement with many but not all i m not that good of the tasting notes above i look forward to playing with it through the winter months well worth a try jmc such a mouth filler so many tastes superb  n 160 aah huge all raisin sherry nose its thick buttery nutty theres a touch of wood varnish burned orange prunes and sugar t 160 vibrant salivating sherry wine delivery very deep and rich in flavour with sweet caramel sugars overlapping one another f 160 theres another sherry wave before a touch of bitter oak wood coffee caramels figs oranges and thick prune juice finishing with a bitter chocolate sherry liqueur and a breath of fresh licourice spices after a few wonderful drams over a few days this bottle isn t taking to well to oxidisation its become dense like a party fruit punch and overly thick with an over abundance of sherry and prune juice c 160 simple and vibrant and yet displaying a lot of maturity more than its 21 years in places this is a rich sherry monster with a soft centre but after a few drams it also becomes arduous and over stewed delightfully rich but also a tad laborious save this for an occasional tipple and enjoy the 15 revival as an everyday drinker scores a bjazzpianofingers fabulous dark sherry colour and spice not great christmas malt with complexity and length yum i have been on a recent kick for sherried scotch and the 21 year old parliament is simply amazing try it you won t be disappointed  good points this whisky is bloody marvelous bad points i ve run out  the 15 year revival is sweeter but the 21 year is in a different class if you re looking for a straight quot sherry bomb quot go for the revival if you want a rich and complex whisky with more spice and body the parliament is an outstanding dram permanent spot on our shelf for sure  i usually buy whiskies in the 80 300 range this offering is quite delightful a good value i detect the raisins vanilla notes which morph into a zesty spicy end the finish is strong though not perhaps a long as i might have hoped for this price you can t miss however like the reviewer before me i think that the glendronach 15 year quot revival quot is superior in quality and it is significantly cheaper  its very good a very balanced complex and dark sherried malt almost as good as 15 yo revival  excellence taste 
37185.0, probably smoothest scotch you can find nice sherry finish can be to soft comparing with other scotches  soft and gentle character very typical for glenmorangie not complex but very decent anyway very pleasant sherry influence probably smoothest scotch i ve ever had so definitely worth buying if you know it is your style or you re planning to drink with people who afraid of scotch  i love you man  fantastic highly recommend spend a couple more bucks and get the quinta ruban 14 yr old  better than expected i 39 m not a big fan of the classic glenmorangie 10 but this changed my thoughts about the distillery it 39 s not the most complex but it combines a bite with drinkability  fantastic balance of smooth and smokey smooth yet still has a bite stunning color when decanted  terrible terrible alcoholic taste 129314 with other flavors terrible as if u made whiskey at home by adding wood chops into moonshine terrible shame for this price 47 will never buy from this brand 128547  i just don 39 t 39 get 39 this whisky bad wood astringent and therefore overpriced never buying this again your money is better spent on aberlour a 39 bunadh glenfarclas 12 or gelndronach 12 this one has a fancy name and is just finish in sherry butts if you want something that has a mix of sherry and x bourbon casks get tomatin 12 it blows the lasanta away for the record i don 39 t like the gelnnmorangie 10 or the nectar d 39 or either but i like the quinta ruban  a lovely highland whisky with a nose palate and finish to help continue my whisky education i will definitely be keeping a bottle in the house my favourite and first choice present for good friends first glenmorangie bottle for me i m half way down first of all it has nice texture and good nose the palate feels too specific but somehow not always the same a bit like transformative red orange marker color finish for me starts great with dried fruits and a little touch of sourness  to me the bourbon is a bit overwhelming i don 39 t dislike bourbon but it bugs me when a scotch carries it 39 s heavy flavors it isn 39 t all bad there are nice complexities here i just wish this scotch was aged in sherry casks rather than just finished in them  absolutely divine whisky recommend it highly one of my favourite whiskey 39 s ott pricing for something not very exciting no aroma as such no great taste and poor finish for me this is a 163 25 bottle max some cheaper whisky 39 s taste far superior to this one won 39 t buy again  another excellent whisky from glenmorangie  caramel a great richness of milk chocolate and a touch of peat the best whisky at this price 163 35  in a word wonderful  for the price this is a steal some of the tastiest scotch i ve ever had worth 100 a bottle  oh scotch heaven yes delicious and perfect my favorite and i have never liked a sherry finished scotch this is amazing thank you try for usa  one of my favourite whiskeys so smooth just the right amount of sweetness only problem is the bottle won t last long as i can t stop myself from getting carried away ha ha this is definitely not one of glenmorangie s best drams when you set it against their quinta ruban it s a no contest and for a slightly higher cost you have a truly memorable dram  light fruity and overall lovely great whisky for a sunny summer day i chill mine in the bottle and have it neat in a light crystal glass it opens up rather well as you it works its way back to the room temperature  am i the only one getting strawberrys this tastes as if flavouring has been added rather than getting the sherry notes fron the 2nd casks orange peel and fairy liquid after taste  at first i thought it was drinkable but unremarkable but it has grown on me since the sherry comes through as a sweet aftertaste on the tongue and i appreciated the slightly oily texture not over sherried like say a macallan but the finish is impressive  the lasanta 12 was a nice touch after the bloody marys while cooking thanksgiving dinner and a nice sipping stomach settler after the big meal nice smooth and aromatic wraps you up like a warm blanket  this seems to get mixed reviews but i preferred it over many others in the glenmorangie range it 39 s slightly different but full of sweet flavours and a decent price too  hello if i want to order in 1 ctn how many bottle with ctn and need to delivery to taiwanis possible delivery  is my impression on this one outright sherry sweetness that 39 s just not very interesting by itself this dram 39 s not bad at all it 39 s smooth and nice and very drinkable and then you forget it good for refreshment but not much for savouring  great value for the price smooth and welcoming the sherry influence make it very enjoyable  bit bland don 39 t really get the impression it 39 s spent too long in sherry casks as i 39 m struggling to detect much in the way of sherry flavour  very good whiskey you feel its way through barrels of sweet sherry  was expecting a rich dram of fruits and caramels nose is a very light caramel and chocolate and the initial taste is sweet and not much else don t waste your money and go for the usual 10 year old a much nicer dram pretty disappointed to be honest  not a glenmorangie fan i ve tried all there 12s with wine cask finish s and out of those this is the best one however it still is watered down and a bit too sweet would benefit from higher abv but there s just too many quality sherried drams that are much better loved the 46 version and bought that several times will not be buying this one again it 39 s good enough but i don 39 t appreciate the drop in abv with so much choice for whisky buyers i 39 m surprised they deliberatley downgrade their product of course it 39 s going to turn people away i 39 ll get something else instead  the perfect example of a whisky i would never buy i had two glass of it last night find it quiet pleasant but so easy and so not fun there is no complexity in this whisky at all it has been probably made for none whisky drinkers it is a good thing for getting new clients i guess but for the others well no thanks i also tried the 18 yo from glenmorangie and the difference is impressive even it is in the same kind of quot taste type quot the 18 yo is far far better just as you know  start of the bottle needed time to breath but once i got to the middle of the bottle i did get 2 lovely drams full of fruitieness and tuns of marzipan flavours which you 39 d expect then towards end of the bottle i didn t get any marzipan flavours also if i swirled around for to long in the mouth then i got a stick dry taste as if i d sucked a boiled sweet for to long so in a nutshell i d rather pay the few pounds more for the nectar d 39 or which i think is a nicer dram  only thing to grumble about here us the price possibly the lowered percentage but if you 39 ve not had the 46 you 39 ll never know not much on the nose initially but let it breathe and you 39 ll find its a truely good dram the sherry finish is a nice way to round out an already fine whisky if you see it on sale add it to your collection well worth a visit  drinkable sherry whiskey find myself using it for cocktails more than a dram or on the rocks i think the quinta or 10 year is a better buy bought this a few months ago and wasn 39 t impressed with my first taste tried it again today and the bottle is improving big fan of the original and i think this is a nice complement to the 10 year finish isn 39 t as long as i might like probably related to the chill filtering but you can 39 t have everything i suppose  good sherry aroma but would have been nicer if aged in sherry casks a little longer maybe it was just my bottle but there are heavy notes of tannin and decayed fruit addition of water brings out more sherry sweetness and possibly some smoke from the charred bourbon barrels  good scotch with some great flavor but i agree with the 3 5 rating there s something about it that puts it into good but not great territory maybe it s that extra little bit of burn on the end of it or a bit of an over flavoring taste but it s a good bottle to have on hand also a few drops of water doesn t hurt  very smooth a very clean long lasting finish let your friends taste it then you will have a better friend for a long long time  i bought this today in the us after enjoying the miniature packed with the pioneer gift set i like the sherry offset i have nothing to compare with this so for me this is a pleasant diversion from traditional 10 year old glen i buy sorry to see it is discontinued both the miniature and the 70cl are 43 for what it 39 s worth  i bought a bottle of this for the father in law for xmas i ordered a 3cl sample for myself hes always been a fan of glenmorangie whereas i ve only tried a few of theirs this is lovely stuff as soon as he opens it on boxing day ill get the glasses from the cupboard for him its smooth fudgey toffee chocolatey creamy but i do love the sweeter sherry cask finishes  omg fantastic vfm i love sherried whiskies benriach px glendronach dailuaine f amp f knockando slow matured bunnahabhain 18 etc i didn 39 t expect so much reward from a motr producer 39 s 12 yo ok i have the nectar d 39 or the quinta ruban and the 18 extremely rare but i had been put off by lacklustre reviews off the lasanta this is smooooooth rich chocolatey a little wintry spicy toffee clotted cream fudge just absobloodylutely excellent i 39 m buying a crate  not as good as their quinta ruban but still very enjoyable the lasanta is definitely worth the money prices vary but i can usually find it for 45 50 usd light and fruity on the nose with a hint of caramel and chocolate but the initial hit on the palate of spice followed by mild peat smoke and nutty undertones the finish has a linger of the spice and peat and tossing it over the rocks or with a couple drops of water expands the florals in the body not quite on the level of my favorite islays but a very good highland for the price point would definitely buy again  this is a lovely wee dram at a cracking price i believe this is one of the best i am not as well versed in scotch whisky as my husband but i do know what i like to drink and this is definitely one of the scotch whisky that i would recommend to anyone who drinks single malt scotch thanks for having it available  it 39 s a glenmorangie with some sherry what 39 s not to love it provides a decent step up from the original by giving it some more stewed fruit notes and oaky influence taking away some of the more bourbon notes that are so prevalent in the original  the 46 is better  i was quite disappointed because the taste is not long and it doesnt really gives a fruity taste on mouth not big aroma it doesnt really smell something has almost same smell like the red label of j walker i tasted this after the glenfiddich rich oak which really has an aroma and a sherry taste maybe that 39 s why i will give it a new try some other day of the various glenmorangies i 39 ve tried this is my favorite so far smooth nice flavors  i really like this lasanta but only in the 46 i was given a 43 bottle and it just wasn t the same you just can t beat the kick of the 46 why they went down in this i don t know a real shame  recognize price will vary around the world in nj usa i get this for 47 usd it is a very good value and has excellent sherry notes competes very well with any scotch at that price  should be priced in the low 50s range good taste but not a rich sherry flavor for a 12yr its pretty good but literally my body chemistry did not mix well with bottle it was a shame a few of my friends were raving about it but when i drank it i really didn 39 t feel great afterwards weird maybe i 39 ll give it another try but in general glemorangie is a fav of mine ginutis i don 39 t know much about scotch but i bought a few high priced scotches that were basically a waste of my money then i saw a youtube video were the was a scotch whiskey expert he gave this particular one a good recommendation so i purchased my first bottle of glenmorangie i will drink this again and keep a bottle in my house it was smooth and had some spice to it for a beginner i would recommend this one  i liked the 46 this one tastes watered down  this is a scotch you must discover im a fan of peated smokey scotch and i have to say that i always have a bottle of this one at home starts slowly and smoothly continue with wood and finish with a small kick of fruit coming from the sherry cask extremely well balanced i dare you to take only one  lacks delicate or creamy the extra abc come through you can do a lot better for the price vanilla on nose hint of honey on palate with smooth finish complex for great price better than macallan 15 one of best values out there i like this one but the 46 vol for me hits the button for me would like to see this in an 50 vol bottle that would be a fantasti hit of flavours why not 
1915.0, the first few times i had this it was practically enemic which is rare for an islay however if your patient enough there are some nice subtle notes and a peppery finish much better islays out there however very smooth not overly peaty and drinkable is a relatively clear pale whisky in colour and smooth to drink a nice contrast to laphorhaig a few drops of cold water also changes the aromatic notes an easy drink by the fire  quite enjoyed it pretty much what i d expect from a 12 year old islay single malt  the worst single malt whiskey i ve ever tasted i have generally enjoyed most 12 year old single malts each have their own characteristic tastes but from the first taste of this one it did not feel right i kept trying for a week to see if i could get used to it but each time it was definitely not agreeable  extremely disappointed a pleasant enough whiskey but doesn t in my opinion have the characteristics of an islay sm and could very easily be confused with a cheap supermarket blend will stick to laphroaig for true peaty smokey loveliness lovely and light peaty and smokey without going too far nice drop  i 39 m relatively new to whisky but cut my teeth on laphroaig and lagavulin 16 i concluded that i didn 39 t like smoky whiskies until that is i tried this this is so amazingly smooth with those lovely peaty and smoky flavours but without being overpowering such a lovely drink and at this price a real bargain  not a peat bomb instead one of the best if not the best coastal whiskies you can get for the money there 180 s so many great and accurate reviews of this islay classic below that it 180 s difficult to add anything to those caol ila 12 beats easily many many trendy and overpriced whiskies funny some much pricey whiskies are only a poor mans versions of caol ila 12 it 180 s so delightful that you can still get something really great without emptying your wallet one advice if you 180 ve never tasted this don 180 t except anything just sit down with the glass and take your time five stars because of the price quality ratio  fantastic dram this one would become one of my favourites read the description on the box very apt poetic description  i love this stuff peaty of course but much more mellow than some others of a similar ilk which i also love complex flavours come after and for me it all comes together beautifully and just reminds me of the sea wonderful dram  they call it the quot entry level quot caol ila ignore that and all the gimmicky moscatel finished variants this is their best product and an absolute classic plenty of the characteristic islay smoke but with a beautiful balance and a long spicy finish  great whisky with typical islay taste medicinal and peaty but very smooth and light  i like smoke and peaty whisky this is more sedate tha 241 some but still a very good dram to drink cheers this bottle that i have just isn 39 t the same smoke taste has that smoke flavor additive taste not sure if it 39 s ny palate or something is a miss not enjoying this bottle monte cristo is accompanying stogie  it 39 s been almost 25 years since i first tried this malt i remember that in those years it was more complex and profound it is always among my favorites but i think its quality has decreased somewhat  nice and smoky both on the nose and the pallate not over powering or tcp tasting like laphroaig can be a beautiful well rounded scotch easily my go to whisky this is one of the best smokey malts i have had so far it defintlitely has that fresh coastal briney smokey vibe from nose to finish and hands down beats lagavulin and laphroig for balance not sure it has as much body and legs though as the more in your face peated drams this is the perfect intro for those new to smokey peated whisky  a tone of smoke is there as well as spicies i wished it was a little more complex  excellent balance of light smoke and hint of sweetness just what the doctor ordered  medium peated salty coastal air on nose and palate hint of fresh seaweed in the distance smoke is gentle and its well rounded and matured properly oily tar cold chimney air spicy at the end finish is good and long gentle smoke lingers not super complex but what is there is so delicious to my taste buds i prefer it over lagavulin 8 laphroig and ardbeg wins though for all you nay sayers shut it go back to your blended scotches if you want smokier go with lagavulin if want a nice balanced whiskey with smokey lightly sweet notes the caol ila 12 is a winner  oily initially to smell and it s clay taste and the after drink finish in the mouth some what fresh nose strong salty leather cut apples olive oil and fresh cherrypalate opens with a very light dry pear and mild burnt grass and light honey then starts to get smoky as the mild flavors like almonds changing to something a little citrus staying light throughout finish light mild honey sweet tinapa apple orange salad aftertaste second finish is a taste of sweet berries and some lingering salt along the toungue and lingering smoke this has the signature characteristics of an islay malt but it 39 s a bit thin and lacking in body i added 25ml of caol ila 12 to 40ml of royal lochnagar 12 and it worked this blend has the bite and salinity of islay but with added body and sweetness alternatively buy an oban 14 which is just lovely  nice islay malt chameleon flavours sour and sweet gooseberry smokey mildly carbolic slightly salty quite a complex young malt and not for beginners i prefer an ardbeg or lagavulin but this is a nice change if pace  this is an everyday dram for me smoky peat blasts of fresh heather grapefruit maybe lingers after salty tingles try 1 then 2 drops of water to bring out a creamy sweetness so smooth on the swallow stunning  i never really knew much about this distillery on islay tried several drams and settled on this monster of a whisky my absolute new favourite nipping ardbeg uigeadail at the post for complexity depth and of course the peat you know is going to smack you in the face if you 39 re drinking an islay liquid one nice measure can last an entire evening keeping you basked in bonfire tar and smoke as you work your way down the glass it is an acquired taste as many islay single malts are but this is one behemoth of a dram and now i find myself pining for the taste if i have anything else that doesn 39 t measure up to the punch this delivers to your taste buds i 39 ll take a case  i don 39 t normally like the peaty taste of most island whiskies but this one is more subtle and really grows on you now finished the first bottle that i was given as a present and ordering another  sweet smokey and mild very close to what i dream of as my perfect single malt should be most of the time  great balance of peat brine and sweetness really nice nose with lemony spice and long finish i ve just had my first glass ready to look for a bottle  a truly wonderful drinking experience sweet fruit thickness savory undertones sweet peat and a long smokey slightly sweet finish at times it feels like eating an entire meal in one drink the peat is wonderfully balanced and pleasant in the mouth for those who enjoy peat if you don 39 t like peat why are you drinking this it would be better at 46 and because of that i feel it is priced about where it should be  this is a bad whisky one of worst i have ever had thankfully i was given this as a present and i didn t waste any of my money on it if in the future if i were to be offered caol ila or bells i will take the bells this is the only whisky i have poured the whole bottle down the sink it is that bad  the 12 yo is the only caol ila i have had full bottle when i opened a bottle i was quite enjoying it the typical islay profile the distillery character the bonfire smoke the elegant body and aromatic sweetness although imo it lacked complexity a little in comparison to other standard islay expressions of similar age ci 12 seemed like a very pleasant nosing and tasting experience overall then i left a bottle untouched for a month or so and decided to give it another go the sea profile has almost disappeared so did the smokiness moreover the finish turned into a very unpleasant one due to being overpowered by oaky biterness and wet ashtray note adding water only increased the bitterness in the finish if you have not tried caol ila 12 you should definitely give it a go you will have a worthy experience however this expression is rather mediocre so do not have high expectations i have decided to get another bottle of caol ila from independent bottlers next in hope to get an amplified experience resulting from natural presentation no colour added no chill filtration and higher abv 46 or over  did not touch it for three weeks and tried it again tonight a way better the big peaty oily herbal taste has evolved to something more fruity and salty with less bitterness i am surprised i did not realised a whisky could change this much in a couple weeks 2 5 to 3 5 stars easy at the end a good one  my first islay and my 3rd single malt whisky after glenfiddich and glenmorangie and this one is very different very peat and smoky with olive oil flavor and bonfires with a citrus notes a pretty good finish too  i am a big fan of islay whisky especially laphroaig and lagavulin but this one nope there is no complexity at all first on the nose a hint of fruit and peat only peat then on the palate it starts quiet well really smooth with some light banana i guess and then again the peat the peat and the peat and this is it i know it is all about personal feelings but how can we possible give 5 stars to this far far away from the laga 16yo laph 10yo ardbeg springbank and many others from islay i just opened the bottle last night and hopefully it will evolve a little bit  i agree with some of the other reviews that this feels and tastes a little thin compared to peatier islay whisky that said this is a smooth libation with a nice dose of peat and many subtle flavours perfect for sipping on after a nice dinner or brunch i have nothing but love for this distillery and would never turn down a dram of coal ila 12  excellent this is my first review and i 39 ve tried probably around 20 different ones so that probably shows how much i enjoyed this came on my islay tasting set and i fell in love after smelling it the palate is phenomenal as well the tasting notes are pretty spot on but there is quite a fair bit of sweetness as soon as you swallow it something similar to a dried fruit sweetness smokiness is just right for me out of all the whiskies i 39 ve tried which aren 39 t many this is the one with the most character so far i wouldn 39 t recommend for a first time whisky drinker but i will for sure be buying a bottle soon  i immediately sensed from the aroma the fruitiness under the acute yet mild smoke on the palate this combination was sensational a wonderful aromatic islay whiskey amazing balanced with peat and fresh citrus notes not bad at all but not as complex as its rivals from islay south coast buy ardbeg 10 or talisker 10 if you like peat and cant afford lagavulin 16 if not and still want something from islay buy bunna 12 e  not as good as the 15 and certainly not in the same universe as the 22 but solid nonetheless such a smooth sweet finish  moldy marrowy saline peat rather complex peat a touch of i would say guano i 39 ve never eaten brains or bone marrow or even bat droppings nor will i but i can imagine that this comes very close to those items gourmet indeed too bad this dram is so overly 39 produced 39 and filtered down at present i agree with that ncf no e150 my dudes possibly my favorite peat though sorry ardbeg  started drinking it reluctantly but when accompanied with a hoyo de monterrey petit robusto it tasted heavenly  lovely but too oily for my taste very controlled but strong smoke and prominent peat liquorice and star anise hiding in there somewhere luxurious mouth feel  well got one for christmas quite thin filtered very heavily clearly and i think coloured as well my fav islay otherwise bloody beans if only they 39 d present it in a completely natural way looking forward to that day not getting another bottle until they do a bit overpriced as many whiskies are nowadays you think you 39 ve found something clean and something true but no they have to mess it all up this world do appreciate the above 40 abv do appreciate tasteful label design  this current version can not take any water ye have been warned  from the quot medicinal quot west coast malts this is the second most enjoyable after talisker in my opinion as complex as it 39 s name is to pronounce correctly but far preferable over tastebud killers like lagavulin or laphroaig  35 minutes in the glass and it comes to life cocoa powder vanilla caramel yellow fruits especially in my opinion pineapple and pineapple peels coal tar soap burning grass musty old bourbon barrels given enough air the cocoa powder gains prominence on the palate something which combines tremendously well with the saltiness of the peat it 39 s an altogether savory and very sweet malt light on the oak left my half drunk bottle open for a couple of hours every other day for a week the second week i had it helped it gain some extra depth a fully natural version of this no chill filtering would be truly something close to excellence 4 5  disappointingly thin stop chill filtering this diageo stop it right now  posso solo dire che non si pu 242 negare la sua grande qualit 224 consigliatissimo anche a chi inizia da poco l 39 incontro con i malti torbati grande  very very thin mouthfeel almost vapourises as soon as it touches the tongue very light it has good complexity and good flavours but the thinness of the malt takes a lot away from it if this whisky was non chillfiltered and 46 it would be an absolute belter but what do i know  yeah caol ila12 the malt may be the the island 39 s mr consistent but diageo the owners of the malt have sworn to keep their consistency about reducing the quality of fine malts chill filtered whiskes do taste thinner and less their non chill filtered ones those who dont believe this get any chill filtered malt and a non chill filtered one and have both side by side and you will note the difference  i remember the taste of the 12 when i first got into whisky much more sophisticated balancing of sweetness and smoke than laphroaig 39 s equivalent note for example however when i taste it now i can 39 t help but feel as though they 39 ve compromised on quality as they 39 ve ramped up production diageo owned after all feels like it 39 s lost it 39 s body and vaporises in the mouth much more quickly disappointing but still an alright dram  i 39 m a fan of the sherried single malt whiskies but this is excellent the peat is not so medicinal as in laphroaig highly recommended  just received this as a birthday present wow i 39 ve always been a fan of the more subtle smokey single malts and for me as a first time taster this is tops nothing about it is overpowering as it 39 s smooth character and nuances develop into the perfect whisky the oily smokey overtones are perfectly balanced i do not find it dry and the sweetness develops on the palate if you give it half a chance a bottle tends to last me a while so it will be interesting to see how it develops enjoy  right at the top of my taste range for smoke any more and i wouldn 39 t want to drink it quite a strong peaty flavour i 39 m sure this will be a big hit with many people i can tell it 39 s good quality but not suited to my tastes  better and stronger than before caol ila has taken its pants off and wants to fight all the islay heavies to a phenol showdown this whisky contrary to what is happening to most other big name whiskies is actually improving i would say this beats the ardbeg 10 easily on spirit quality and is also better than the totally overpriced and overrated lagavulin 12 buy this and say no to overrated overhyped and overpriced whisky though admittedly i do remember caol ila being cheaper than this a couple of years ago but at least it 39 s better can you say the same ardbeg talisker lagavulin i don 39 t think so  great value for peat lovers out there smooth woody minerals briney smokey gentler than other islays with a subtle sweetness everything i love about islay with the jump in price of the various laphroaig offerrings and also the better talisker offerings the once comparatively pricey caol ila has suddenly found itself in the reasonably priced range for its undoubted quality this is a much more balanced dram than the laphroaig 10 or select cask and has a lot more smoke and balance than any of the nas taliskers ardbeg 10 is cheaper but not as good to be honest if this was 10 cheaper it would be my go to bottle as it has the depth of flavor and the right balance of smoke and peat with an appealing sweetness and oily mouthfeel  tried many smoky and peaty whiskies from islay this seems more unnatural like jw double black well for the price almost the same as jw i put 3 and half stars  wasn 39 t impressed with first 2 drams put it away for a couple of months tried it again and wow peety taste and aroma had mellowed considerably this allowed the briney and sweet flavors to become more pronounced enjoyed my next 3 drams with aurora perfidios 1903 ruby cigars excellent taste combination of the caol ila mingling with the leathery cocoa and coffee flavord of the aorora returned for the final couple of drams only to discover my oldest teenage son finished it off with a coca cola mixer jesus wept  delicious islay whisky somewhat smoother than other islay whiskies this is the perfect single malt for me a wonderful peaty smoky treat that doesn 39 t over power the palate nice smokiness to the nose then a smooth toffee like peat that warms and comforts then a tremendous finish top of the class  wonderful i 39 m a big ardbeg and peaty whisky fan but i do drink and enjoy others this was my first try at caol ila it 39 s very lemony my gf who is pretty much appalled by whisky especially peaty stuff tried this and said how much she was surprised by the sweet taste didn 39 t like the bitter smoky finish though he he almost like lemon sherbet sweets and there is that islay peat tang that hits you with oysters sea shells and beach bonfires the finish is very dry a bit like the 8 yo lagavulin i tried recently but was only moderately smoky compared to others in its 39 class 39 i 39 m just over half way through the bottle opened 2 weeks give or take and it has become less peaty smoky and more sweet in that time i added a couple drops of water when first opened but think its best neat as it is now some reviews i 39 d seen said the peat levels were much less than ardbeg 10 yes its not as intense but the peat levels are still pretty decent if that 39 s you 39 re thing it does lack on the smoke front though for me and i 39 m not sure if the finish is spirit or cask led very dry almost too much bitter tannins not a direct comparson but reminds me of laphroaig quarter cask  absolutely love it  one of my favs bottle has ran out due to being my 39 go to 39 bottle in the cabinet  my favourite of all whiskies can 39 t explain it but there is something very special in the taste that i really enjoy the whisky for me  this is an absolutely wonderful islay scotch it 39 s not lagavulin 16 which is my personal favourite scotch but it 39 s much cheaper here in canada than lagavulin lovely peat smoke hints of toffee and some nice brine on the finish definitely worth your time  to all those that say it tastes like turpentine or tcp whatever stick to alcopops as clearly you have no idea about good whisky  love this one great peat plus a fruity note  delicate phenol notes ash sweetened dry fruit with a seaside breeze on the nose the finish is long and lasting on the palate i want more heaven sent  those that don 39 t like peat or complexity in their scotch should stick to a blended with ice and soda that way they will avoid the feeling they are in biology lab maybe throw in some ice cubes too lol  a delicious infusion of peat dried fruits and sea salt to give this nectar a sliky sweetness with a hint of smoke in the background perfect scotch with a nice cigar  formaldehyde smell i distinctly remember that smell from high school biology when dissecting a cat taste is turpentine just like another reviewer mentioned had glenlivet 12 had glenfarclas 17 both are great this was cheap bathtub swill  this is not going to be helpful but i was having a glass while smoking a cuban on my birthday all was well in the world it was smooth and smoky and unctuous loved it too much smoke for me it seems antiseptic  for the past hour and a half i 39 ve had around 20mls each of arbelour 15 double cask royal salute 21 glenfiddich 18 and caol ila 12 in that order and i prefer this for the balance of sweetness and smokiness and at a price that 39 s far lower than the rs 21 and gf 18 too oh well taste is subjective and to each his her own cheers  laphroaig quarter cask was my favourite but without realising it i 39 m on my 4th half of the night and want another no water no ice just let it sit in your mouth savour the smoky taste and enjoy  great stuff love the smoky aftertastecolour is just right as well odd tcp antiseptic taste quite nice with chocolate best on islay mild but remenicent of old smells of bygone old ways when the sheep came in to spend to night to wallow in the smell and cosiness of a time now long gone was looking for a slightly smokey whisky at a reasonable price after drinking talisker dark storm we wanted something a little lighter on the palate this is a beautiful malt and so drinkable will definitely be going into our wedding quiche on may 10  i was excited about this bottle than quickly disappointed to me it just tastes like cheap american bourbon with a tiny hint of smoke at the end it tastes identical to highland park 12 to me and my wife i almost think we got a bottle that wasn 39 t a good representation of caol ila because a lot of people really love this drink like the review under mine i 39 m also a laphroaig lover this left a lot to be desired for me  i 39 m normally a laphraoig man all day long but in my opinion caol ila 12 pushes the 10 yr laphraoig very close i was very pleasantly surprised by how good this is  very underrated at this price point it 39 s hard to imagine a better islay single malt using the same water and peated malt as lagavulin it 39 s fascinating to see how different a beast this is bright yet with honey and heather on the tongue there is still some lovely subtle smoke i really love this one  will drink this all day any day at the price point even over the ardbeg like it better than more quot trendy quot bottles like lagavulin 16 hope it stays under the radar  horrible  flavoursome easy on the palate fresh but still smoky on the first sip after taste is amazing and continuing lovely velvet finish with a touch of spice love it my other favs are the ardbeg uigeadail talisker dark storm and mortlach  new to the world of whiskey someone gave me a bottle of bowmore and it took me a year or so to open it thats where it started anyway i am rambling back to the caol ila wow first blast i thought bloody hell dont like this smelt of cough candy and stale cigars added a drop of watter and left it 20 mins peppermint comes through smoke is andsome my lovverlys and what a taste explosion in my mouth roll it round your tongue and it will smack you in the back of the head like a brick wrapped in lemon not 3 bad at all to my rather inexperienced taste would i buy it again hell yes  smooth and smoky with lots of flavours and a great finish great scotch so far from everything we have had very hard to get right now in canada  it 39 s a camp fire love memories and desire in liquid form it 39 s been my go to scotch for years  excellent present for christmas kip wake to me needs cold water the right glass time and rookie humility i found intriguing and delicious not as smokey as an ardbeg in my view i like to drink all my whiskey with a touch of cold water however with this one you must in my opinion drink it with a touch of cold water to enjoy its flavours otherwise you just lose all the flavours and perfumes in its strenght i 39 m not much of an islay man preferring the sherrybombs but i liked this one pretty unique flavor profile first whiff is all seaside with the salt coming through then the light peat and a citrusy fruity note not the ripe or overripe fruityness of a speysider grassy herbal minty almost the smoke comes through clean with meat smoked ham is about right on the finish and it stays for some time pretty intriguing recommend with a splash of water many won 39 t like it because the flavors are not very sweet i mean whoever thought of the lingering taste of smoked meat in their whisky but if you have a taste for adventure and whimsy the out of the ordinary the unexpected why not i actuallyfound this more what 39 s the right word charming than the laph 10 the latter is all muscle and muscle has its uses it this makes you wonder because its got more surprises up its sleeve 7 10 for me if you judge it right as it should be judged in its class no point comparing something like this with a glenfarclas not worth a damn should 39 ve left it at the kennel  the wife and i both like this one the most  at first i thought this was an offensive smelling shot of paint stripper but after a minute of airing the true brilliance of this 12yo single malt came through and i find my self loving this a lovely earthy and smoky aroma and flavour a sort of campfire smokiness rather than the cigarette ash of some other lesser whiskys  i do not want detailed about this whisky but if you like an a complex smokey flavor at an affordable price try it you will not be disappointed  good its a gently friuty light peated whisky i like it  this whisky tastes like a very bland bowmore it has a very damp earthy taste but nothing else to offer was somewhat excited to try this one but was very disappointed if you want islay stick with lagavulin or laphroaig  i 39 m no whiskey connoisseur i am merely a whiskey lover so i can 39 t address flavor nuances and hints of this or that my evaluations run between like love and wild about i have yet to taste a whiskey that i dislike my favorites have always been the highland whiskeys as they tend to be on the peaty and smoky side i tasted caol illa 12 for the first time in sweden a gift from a friend the first sip was a bit of a burn then came the incredible aftertaste the second sip was perfectly rounded i fell in love with it from that moment on when i had my chance to visit scotland i would drink it at every pub that carried it i also brought a bottle home too bad there are weight limits on flights this one falls in the category that i 39 m wild about  being a fan of islay whiskies i never tasted caol ila before what a great taste this one has i love bowmore lagavullin and other islays but this one is one of my top three favorites  smell is nice and smokey unripe citrus antiseptic green apples grapes touch of toffee and a little floral note with water woods open up more peaty licorice salty briny sweeter vanilla bit more lovely taste is peppery smokey hot burnt my palate with out a little water with water sweeter oak notes grapes a plenty licorice toffee vanilla again red apples pepper resins quite complex after taste peppery aromatic pines smoke campfire slightly sweet with smoke lingering yummy complex unassuming in the 1st sips ripens as you go provided you take your time and let it open up  picked this up at the saq i was told it shared a lot of the same flavour profiles as the lagavulin 16 my first dram to be honest was terrible i didn 39 t have the ideal glass however i got strong notes of smoke and an off putting taste of battery acid i put the bottle away for a week and was rather disappointed second dram maybe the glass maybe it could breath but this is a good bottle foryour money not as tamed as the lagavulin 16 but well balanced in smoke and spice along with a smooth but bold finish  caol ila 12 y is nothing less than the very best whisky i ever had the exquisite pleasure of tasting and drinking i have tasted some amaingly 30 60 years though i do not have that many of those like mccallen high park talisker and the oldest releases of glenfiddich they are almade diffrently than caol ila with regard to degree of smooking however compared this just 12y old caol ila to similar ones or in he same class then caol ila is seemingly superior than not only those which one normally would compare to as well as being the basic for any whisky rating the smoky taste set aside this 12y old caol ila has got extraordinary qualiies which may very well not be able to explain but the qualities superceed many very old and special edition plus single cask at cask strength editions we are taking large number of extremey bespoken and higly celebrated expensive whiskies from best makers and some bottled 30 50 years ago that this caol ila supercced in taste by consensus by consensus from a large numbers of members of our esteemed whisky society here votes was 741 that has begtten the abve mentioned review against 111 that took mainly took the position that the price difference amounting to asmuch as 20 000 pound sterling was linked to the quality as well well we many that have opened one of these very expensive bottles in excess of 25 50 000 pound sterling sometimes was this whisky quite unique but there is none additional qualities of such superb taste that had set any of these old bottles aside lke for instance the 3 oldest glenfiddish where one really cannot tell it apart from one of the high end standard bottles best regards duxalex caol ila is really fascinating experience ever i had the flaavour is having sweet aroma and woody smoky smell always attracting single malt lovers got this today at my local liquor store and it is awesome starts out very minty and peppery with some nice sea salt and a nice touch of distinctive peat smoke the finish is quite meaty almost like smoked ham or bacon and it just keeps getting better as you drink it a little peppery for my tastes but it is quite a good dram one of my new favs and i would definitely buy this again  i gave my flavor pallet to my quot spirit guide quot he recommended this bottle instead of the big brand name on sale at the time i am very surprised by the quality at this price point there are several bottles of lesser quality product for twice this price point  my experience is almost identical to hmmmmmm a couple of weeks ago my first dram i let air for about 10 15 minutes before trying i was sorry i bought this stuff i 39 ll never buy this again etc a few days later i tried it again and i fell in love this is going into my favorite five to me it has the perfect balance of peat smokiness and sweetness truly great stuff i 39 ve found an online source that i get from and have been getting a bottle a week along with lagavulin 16 and talisker 10 cheers  i 39 m a big fan of the 12 year old and have usually enjoy this neat however it seems as if diafeo has changed the flavour profile somewhat and it doesn 39 t seem as inviting as before there 39 s more of a phenolic note present and the sweetness present in previous versions is not as pronounced could diageo have altered the recipe in order to allow for caol ila to take the place of lagavulin within the johnnie walker black label blend  i feel one should enjoy a cigar with this one maybe a glass of water at almost sub zero temperatures on the side it also feels too oily over all it was an interesting beverage solid 4  opened this a few days back and thought it was ok no big deal it 39 s nice took it out yesterday night startedsipping well it 39 s the next day in the afternoon now afetr i slept of course and i started sipping again i 39 ve got other bottles to savor but this caol ila just quot got me quot was it the dinner that affected my palate and taste buds earlier now the dram is totally delicious amp drinkable neat i 39 d fancy this over the bowmore 12 maybe even the talisker 10 and it seems a bit lighter and less complex than the laga 16 but in a good warm amp relaxed way very very nice  very similar to ardbeg 10 without the bitter chocolate finish not as meaty as lagavulin but the smoke has almost a quot orchard fruit wood bonfire quot feel lovely middle ground every day whisky my favorite islay  tthe smokey finish with you from scotland to the us  this is sweet stuff indeed peaty smoky some distant fruit but sweet sweet finish recommend for people who seek something a little different really nice islay malts are my favourite laphroaig especially but caol ila is absolutely beautiful slightly subtler on the smokiness when compared to laphroaig but in a nice way and with a lovely citrusy note that cuts through the smoky oiliness with a fantastic balance between the two love it  not particularly noteworthy a competent whisky lacking personality  tastes like chloroseptic spray i paid how much for this  i have been nursing a bottle of caol ila 12 for the past 6 months it just hit me how great this stuff really is it has an oily brineyness to it that somehow remains delicate in nature throughout the whole experience like zesty fruit meets oily brine special stuff that will definitely make an impression plenty of medicinal peatiness great for colder weather quot bonfires on a new england beach in fall quot to quote ralfy somewhere between lagavulin and talisker you 39 ll find this baby it has a salty smoky nose and body en has a long and satisfying aftertaste second bottle for me and certainly not the last bottle not as sweet as a highland park 12 but has more balls  my brother in law brought caol ila and i brought glenfiddich to my daughter s wedding on martha s vineyard last month caol ila was wonderful and to my taste others do not measure up  balanced smoke and peat with fruits and sweet not the most challenging whisky and the finish isn t spectacular but the nose and palate is well worth the price definitely better than i thought it would be with some underwhelming reviews from some respectable critics the savory flavors really match well with the oily sweetness if only at 46 and ncf with no caramel added  i m fairly new to scotch but have been trying quite a few fell in love with macallan 12 yo and highland park 12 but decided to venture out into the smoky and peaty flavours of islay heard much about caol ila and decided to try it it is very very good whisky indeed very smoky and powerful but just really a wonderful drinking experience even for a beginner would i buy a bottle of it absolutely top shelf  i found cao ila the smoothest of all the islay whisky s i have tasted which makes for easy enjoyable drinking spot on with the notes scapa 16 yr so far at the top of my list followed by bunnahabhain 12 yr special edition reserve  i ve been drinking single malt whisky with no smokie tones for many years time to make a change became with call ila this whisky bring me to a different level of enjoying with deeply structured aroma and very long aftertaste with absence of alcohol tone where universe of hundreds tastes requires your attention and waking up your taste sense immediately  very specific feels like a medicine but god damn a perfect medicine you keep enjoying hours after last dram best from highly smoky whiskies  this was the very first smoked whisky i have been tasting and i was positively surprised about it i still enjoy this nice whisky indeed gp but instead of 65 us i d rate this at more like a 40 price as in what i pay for laphroaig 10 or ardbeg 10 doesn t make sense for it to be this price but at 40 it would be a very decent dram  purchased at very short notice in a sleety storm in barnsley from a supermarket on our way to a burn s night celebration im not sure why i picked this one the selection was good and i m a big unpeated fan so was ready for some bruichladdich obviously a liberal dose of peat in this one makes it almost a polar opposite having always had myself as not being a fan of peat overcoming the very pungent nose introduced me to a wonderful smooth rich but also delicate smoky dram doesn t suit added water i m so impressed i m going to submerse myself in the world of peaked whisky and see if i need to re evaluate my palate fantastic i got a bottle of this at christmas during the height of a cold by boxing day half the contents were gone and i was feeling much happier it s characteristically islay containing briney and peaty notes though it s nowhere near as aggressive as ardbeg laphroaig or lagavulin if you re new to islay whisky this one s probably the best to start you out it has the savoury flavours of the sea and smoke but with a gentle warm soft touch  at all the rave reviews for this particular whisky has a very medicinal nose and oily mouth feel the taste can only be described as that of the smell of smoke which lingers for too long while not totally unpleasant its certainly not the best single malt in this market bracket but perhaps worthy of a taster  sweet and smoky wonderful palate it s all about oil plus some islay peet and smoke oil in the nose oily texture smooth oily palate fantastic long friendly finish sweet oily and quite spicy  i love this whisky there is nothing more to say  i once went into a bar and someone had ordered this it had a very good label  k 248 ber en i julegave til min svigers 248 n og satser p 229 at f 229 lejlighed til at pr 248 vesmage  i m nearing the end of my first bottle of caol ila 12 and it s been excellent very unique positively medicinal  caol ila 12 was the first bottle of islay whisky i purchased for my home cabinet i was attracted by the rumors of exquisite quot balance quot between sweetness and smoke and i was not at all disappointed i get an immediate sweetness in the nose of soft fruits honeydew melons peat comes along with a minty edge the palate follows along appropriately with a rock candy sweetness and a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel the sweetness gives way to fresh baked bread and toasted nuts gentle smoke dominates the finish and is ultimately carried away by that wonderful islay sea breeze  what can i say islay whisky from the finest this was my first islay whisky and i really liked the smoke and peat flavors so it made me check out a few other islay brands like ardbeg and laphroaig those are a more expensive but also more complex and richer in taste and i do prefer them a little bit over caol ila but the latter sure stand it s ground  good one recommended this was my first islay whisky but this tasted really awful i felt sick after just nosing it a few times i can t really explain it but it tasted really bad even after adding some water i couldn t keep it in i quess islay whisky just isn t for me  lovely whiskey just sad that i have to wait 4 work days to get it to sweden fruity but powerful complex but simple just overall a great whiskey  reminds of the ardbegs but re tuned with more pronounced oily finish a well balanced smoky whisky  i was surprised how similar this is to the laphroaig 10 a littler milder perhaps not that that s a bad thing but after all the rave reviews i had expected it to be quite different  tried this whiskey at my friend s over the weekend and i have to admit i was not expecting such a surprisingly tasty and relatively unknown drink totally recommended  it is true that call is aged on mainland scotland although nowhere in scotland is more than 40 miles from the sea so it is not especially important but the distilling is and call gets a better share of copper surfaces than most as good as you will find d anywhere the 12 is in fact better than the 25 a five star dram  it always amuses me when fairly uneducated people comment on caol ila about it s unique islay qualities it is in fact taken off the island as soon as it is distilled and matured wholly on the mainland not quite what it says on the bottle  this is a very nice whisky also recommendable for beginners like me i would give it 4 5 star if it was without artificial coloring  the answer was of course caol ila this was a very nice surprise i think i had become an ardbeg snob so there are other islay s which are well worth the investment one bottle on order please and dont spare the horses  highly recommend the finish is long and gloriously warming nice balance not as hard hitting as brother ardbeg but complex enough for a late evening dram brill love islay whisky and this is a very good one a must try  light but packs a punch too nice sweetness a must try  light scent of medical adhesive definite taste of smoked meat and aftertaste of smoke or ash for all that it s not unpleasant i d try the 12 year old again certainly try a different coal ila expression  not as good as laphroaig 10yo or even bowmore 12yo i was a bit disapointed because people brag about this dram i guess laphroaig spoiled me p for people who like islay malts but find laphroig a bit too full on i recommend this it s oily salty and grassy and kind of like a really smooth and refined version of talisker if you could drink embers they would taste like this  went to play golf with old navy buddies and everyone brought a flask with them and each flask had a different whisky in it mine having the 12 year old caol ila by the time we finished playing my flask was the only one empty because my buddies drank it all for now on i m keeping it to myself terrific whisky  this is a must to try i have never tasted anything similar to this single malt you love it or hate it i love it not for beginners though beginners go with speyside or lowland single malts  along with bowmore 12 caol ila 12 is a classic example of medium peatiness and as such a good introduction to the islay style less complex than the bowmore but none the worse for it it delivers a good dollop of smoke and it s a great alternative to lagavulin if you want to save a tenner  whilst i ve always liked some of the islays i ve previously stuck to a limited few and am not that taken with lagavulin i was therefore really pleased to find how delicious caol ila is having never heard of it before i m definitely going to buy some more  bao demais da conta veio tao bao quanto uma cachaca de salinas i was in ny 2 weeks ago nov 2011 and a scotish lady recommended amazing good  really delightful stuff and great value for money really good whisky nice drink nice health  and what a price 4 this one great stuff  peat and the sea but boy it s good oily finish makes it last an improvement on the previous caol ila 12 a great stereotypical isla 
1933.0, great easy going whiskey wish it were easier to find here in the southern usa subtle but lasting flavours quite delicate very very little no smokey flavours as the description states good dram easy to drink and has you wanting more each to their own if you like a laphroaig or the like you wont like this  a fine delicate rather feminine scotch closer to the dalwhinnie than islay whiskeys but the flavours are quite delicious not a dram for the macho palate i use lagavulin when i 39 m in that mood but a subtle and quite splendid whisky  absolutely should have been 43 as it is its very basic and delicate doesn t take water at 40 or you ll risk loosing flavor when its falling apart  am entry level whisky just had my first bottle amp would not want to would not get another soon  i have enjoyed several bottles of this over the years and i thought it was time to reacquaint myself with an old friend it 39 s as elegant and complex as ever citrus fruits and nuts and flowery perfume and a long sweetness on the finish it 39 s not for you if you prefer big sherry speyside whiskies like glenfarclas but it is subtle and gentle and a very pleasant aperitif  it 39 s a pretty good whisky nothing special tho i doubt i 39 m ever gonna get another bottle of it i would recommend it as an entry level whisky  un ottimo whisky questo cragganmore 12 che dire si lascia bere con molta facilit 224 senza tralasciare nulla al caso del suo meraviglioso sapore dello speyside veramente un grande whisky per i suoi 12 anni lo si pu 242 competere anche con i pi 249 anziani da bere e gustare all 39 infinito  i always have a bottle in the house open up the bouquet with a splash of water and it is like the nectar of the gods delicious everything else is second best for me it is quite humorous to read the wide range of reviews for cragganmore here but i suppose if you 39 re looking for a heavy peaty islay you shouldn 39 t be drinking this anyway  this was absolutely horrible i enjoy the finer blends and thought i 39 d step out off the high horse and give the little guy a shot boy was that a dumb idea i got about 10 different bottles from a friend closing her liquor store and this was one of them i 39 m glad i didn 39 t pay full price for this hobo hipster piss  loved it for the superb smoothness on the palate and how easy it felt on the tongue nothing harsh at all in the notes if anything the floral notes made it i dare say a little feminine overall a very pleasurable malt my brother got me one for my bday i didn t think much of it well im impressed for what it is i love it 128591 127996  i have very mixed feelings about this malt it ticks a lot of boxes but overall doesn 39 t satisfy it 39 s not a complex dram but neither is it a session dram i find i get tired of it after a glass or two if i want something sweet and floral i 39 d rather have clynelish 14 which is much brighter and sparkier if i want something sherried i 39 d rather have bunnahabhain 12 which is a far more interesting drink cragganmore has great mouthfeel it has a nice saltiness it 39 s decent but not great michael jackson said it has the most complex aroma of any whisky well either he was tripping that day or the current expression is a pale shadow of whatever it was he drank i don 39 t think i 39 d buy another bottle  well surprised with this little gem fantastic blend of long lasting flavours normally associated with much more expensive drams a must iiwilln anyones whisky cdabiney will definitely be back for more  considering the price it is a whisky you have to try i do prefer by fare peaty or complex whisky from islay but i find this one enjoyable and easy to drink perfect with friends and family that drink once in while it is quiet close to a bushmills 10yo probably more spicy with a longer finish i find it despit everything a bit to focused on the lemon other than that sweet floral and well balance whisky  in summary just picked this one up and had to crack her open pop the cork and there s sherry on the palate is leather right off creamy maltiness chestnuts and spice cardamon it has a long malty cereal finish which is more apparent after a few drops of water but no sweetness emerges very subtle sherry notes  this has been on my wishlist for a very long time but only just got round to ordering a bottle after all these years wow superb whisky for the price i 39 d go as far as to say its now one of my all time favourites my only regret is not discovering it earlier  i haven 39 t had this whisky for a few years and i 39 d forgotten what an excellent malt it is it 39 s fragrant and delicate on the nose to taste it 39 s dry flowery and smooth with a finish that goes on and on and on i certainly wont leave it as long before my next bottle once this one 39 s gone  despite my relative youth in the world of scotch i know i don 39 t like peat though i 39 m curious but wary about smoky whiskies that 39 s why i decided to try a very lightly smoked whisky and cragganmore just happened to fit the bill it has a very balanced flavour it 39 s not overly sweet or sickly the sweetness gives body to the whisky but the spice cuts through it so it doesn 39 t get sickly and the finish is quite long i don 39 t profess to be able to taste any particular type of berry or nut but i can taste that it 39 s very balanced and very drinkable i 39 m going to re order this without a doubt  drinkable balanced intellectual ever ever in need of a sharper finish  cragganmore may not be the best whisky in the world but it is very drinkable wonderfully smooth with a delicate addictive aroma  tried this disappointing not sherried at all as far as i can taste and whilst not unpleasant not very exiting either for almost the same price can get the much rounder aberlour 12 great value for money cost 36 in greece still prefer talisker but if you are not to smoky this is great i usually prefer islay or leather whiskies but love the richness and depth of cragganmore by far my favorite speyside better than more expensive macallan though i never refuse one of them either  my first taste was in a restaurant and it was smoother than a baby 39 s ass i think that there is little that can touch it for the the price its age and above all its kindness it gives so much and asks so little  absolutely dreadful scotch all you taste is the floral notes it is not at all smoky nutty or peppery it is very sweet i will give it 1 star because it goes well with cherry coke that is the only way it is palatable i only bought it because the liqour store was out of my go to it was a waste of 50  a scotch every person should try to drink at least once honey oak spice orange and a smoky and pleasant finish there might be better scotches around but this one will not burn a hole in your hip pocket  mmmmmm  one of the finest malts available this is in a nutshell a typical example of a diageo product uninteresting but easy to drink one that 39 s likely desgined to appeal to the masses ultimately uninteresting but decent enough in both quality and price one for the scotch beginner  cragganmore 12 was my second foray into what i 39 d call gentleman 39 s scotches or real scotches unfortunately i tasted it and its diametrically opposed super smokey cousins to the west it 39 s not bad for the price it 39 s not bad at all for me i 39 m not really a fan of sweet things in general so this wasn 39 t a great scotch it is smooth and has really fine subtle hints of florals i 39 d say it 39 s well balanced from beginning to end and has a creaminess which was a little off putting but not undesirable i might revisit it when i can taste it against similar whiskeys for the money nothing else is close  i don t mind saying this one certainly has me captivated this is the first scotch i ve ever tried that seems to deliver a different flavour to my palette almost every time i sip it one moment it s beautiful sweet honeyed fruity the next sip it s blowing up with ambery vanilla tones the next a slight peaty smokiness with a soft saltiness and so on i think i d like to call it a chameleon but not one with bright colours because these flowing changes are somewhat subtle yet seemingly very complex how can one not want to come back to see what s next i have to say that this is rather an enjoyable experience as it s not like any experience i ve had with a single malt to date such changeability keeps me intrigued how interesting you are cragganmore 12 year interesting indeed the box indicates a long finish i d certainly agree with that but its not a loud finish more a soft subtle complexity that seems to continue to unfold in unexpected ways yet not always true to its chameleonic nature certainly a very creamy texture to it and one that leaves me wanting a little more perhaps because i love a little more punchiness to the smoky aspects of which i find in this to be very soft but it perhaps fits the tone as this is a softer scotch overall that reveals itself in complex subtitles rather than loud opulent overtones of flavour certainly worth a try just for the experience  when i thought glenmorangie was the malt not any more  i 39 m halfway through my bottle of crag12 in less than 2 weeks as a daily nightcap cheers  was a solid single malt that i would certainly give someone to introduce the world of single malt scotch this is a very mellow honey filled dram that seems to constantly push the honey notes over and over all the way through the finish on my palate i did not receive even a hint of the pepper that the tasting notes specify unfortunately this is what i bought the initial dram for  i 39 m new to this beast but it will be my constant companion from here on in gorgeous floral bouquet redolent of late summer meadows creamy buttery smooth in the mouth good vanilla hint of sandalwood slight nutmeg note the finish is ok with no unpleasantness but no more than you 39 d expect at the price absolutely knocks the socks off of the macallan amber which i bought same day and tasted back to back what the hell is going on in edrington group wake up guys you are selling your brand down the river  i like how smoth this was and the price makes this whiskey really worthy to buy  super  not a bad whiskey nice clean flavour however for what it is it 39 s a bit pricey for a similar price at least where i live you can get gems like lagavulin 16yo aberlour 12yo or dalwhinnie 15yo all of which surpass the cragganmore in my opinion  very rich and delicatte aromas excellent texture and well blended tastes a wise choise  rich aromatic nose sweet and mighty palate smooth some honey and more notes of nuts berries after nuts as i left caramel sweetness for a short period of bitterness the finish is of okey length it could have last a little bit longer but okey i could only find a little remembrance of smoke yes peppery spice before a dry ending very good whisky a teaspoone of water to the glass opens up for subtile aromas and it makes it even smoother interesting  two words mothers milk  after a couple of weeks in schotland trying several single malts we came back to the netherlands and found a bottle of cragganmore 12years for 26 24euro 18 pounds for 70cl we were amazed by it 39 s complexitity and the warm smooth feeling in our mouths it took us some time to decipher component parts of the smell then the tast and finaly also the finish we took our minds of it by playing cribbage for a while and tried it again this seemed to do the trick conclusion nose hay beginning to ferment sweet malty with honey tones almost a good desert wine in a field of wild flowers with a touch of leather palate exuding warmth and smoothness in the mouth bittersweet and smokey a bit like slightly browned christmas cake fruit finish perfumed lightly smokey wood light spicy and peppery and once again right at the end a memory of flowers in a grassy meadow the aftertast seemed to go on and on we found this a fascinating surprise and worth much more money than we paid for it this is a big big whisky we think of this as one of the best single 12 years old malts we have ever tasted s amp l to date the best single malt under 50 00 that i have found  i have been collecting scotch whiskey and tasting it for the past 30 years and introduced to it a month ago it is the best for the price my radrating 5stars i received a bottle as a gift and i waited to open it with my scotch drinking friend martin i usually drink it on the rocks with a little soda he drinks it on the rocks or neat we both took a sip and our eyes widened and we looked at each other it was delicious smooth a real gem we have been trying to find a place that has more than one bottle at a time so i decided to go to the source thanks  having had this gem many times it seems to get better every time i buy it i wish it was 46 abv no chill castration used then it would be a jewel in the sun my favorite is dalwhinnie 15 yr 43 abv and also chill filtered you can 39 t have everything steve g boston ma  to smokey for me i guess i should have read the packaging other wise i found it rather flat and uninteresting first tried this company 39 s product over 30 years ago and was sold on the soft gentle touch to the throat no burning or throtlling at the back of the mouth went well with me haggis hic saddly a little pricey  we visited the distillery many years ago and were shown around by the foreman as their visitor guide was off after a great tour we were invited to help ourselves from a bottle of 10 yo still 3 4 full i asked if we may finish it and the foreman said we many as well so we did best distillery tour ever and an outstanding dram at that the malt to represent speyside in the diageo 39 s six classic malts that says it all  smooth light floral oak flavor i like a good dram of crag 12 once in a while it s different than my usual heavy peated scotch there s a very nice fruity and oky touch on the palate that i like to have say i m sitting next to a bonefire that being said i don t personaly taste the uniqueness and deepness of other more complex scotches still pretty good value  i studied abroad in scotland this past year and my mission was to choose two malts to bring back to the us with me for the price this is the best whiskey i had in scotland noted i am a poor student and a lot of the whiskeys i tasted were not a whole lot more expensive than this and i am relatively new to whisky however this whiskey is a solid choice for anybody who is not absolutely rolling in dough it is extremely well priced for the flavor complexities it is great choice to pull out when you have guests it is smooth enough complex enough and cheap enough to be a pretty bad ass part of anyone s entertaining repertoire it s also a good representation of a spayside malt my favorite thing by far though is it s musical progression nose palate finish i think the different stages of tasting flow exceptionally well in a dram of this a lot of whiskys are jarring in their progression which can be exciting like a mosh pit but cragganmore 12 is like watching koyaanisqatsi for the first time musically elegant and simple but slowly developing this sublime complexity as it unfolds  quite a dull dram not bad but nothing good to say about it either at this price and whisky level would stick to a balvenie cragganmore 12 yr scotch is one the best whisky s i have ever tasted i wish it had more backbone e g 43 abv and no dam n chill filtering but all this nit picking aside it s still a great dram do yourself a favor get some  as an islay lover i find this too subtle and smooth if that s what you re looking for in a whisky go for it but i don t recommend cragganmore for folks seeking more powerful flavors that being said this is an excellent example of speyside character and worthy of a try if only they would cut down on the chill castration sorry i meant filtration  i have bought quite a few scotches pricewise and i ve been searching scotch quite a few years i must say this is one of the best i ve tasted for less than 100 i would definitely recommend  i agree with consensus that this is a fine standard speyside without much complexity or style apart from its fabulous nose diagio ought to cut the chill filtering and bump up the abv to 45 then they could have a real winner here  самый лучший виски что пробовал супер  so i ve always been drawn towards peaty islay malts with ardbeg and lagavulin on top a friend treated me to a dram of this and i realised instantly that there is a beautiful world outside of islay this malt is sweet elegant and highly drinkable whoever you are i suppose  my favourite this is the chosen one for me  and pleasant to the palate and nose a decent smooth lasting finish as well too easy to drink and i better not get too attached to it or i might become an alcoholic agree with the other post this is definitely not sherried  this whisky is not sherried diageo say if you email them that its first fill bourbon  i will try to express my opinions without using one and same word quot experienced quot whiskey lovers aroma the first attempt a pleasant sweet smell of sugar if divide the whole range of flavors in parts i do not know what it looks like but i do not feel nuts no milk chocolate there is no floral scent like in glenlivet 12 after a drop of water and a couple of minutes clearly felt in the flavor of something fresh something similar to an apple and that s all the main flavor something pleasant and sugar taste exactly the same as the smell drunk very easy and pleasant unfortunately i could not feel anything in the taste of the familiar best suited word spices finish too pleased long felt the heat and after the third sip unobtrusive taste of bread the general impression in comparison with glenlivet 12 perfect  еще один из 6 ки классик молт очень хороший и яркий представитель региона вкус и запах миндаль пряности ваниль и корица приятный согревающий виски translation using google translate another one of the 6s classic malt very nice and bright representative of the region taste and smell almonds spices vanilla and cinnamon pleasant warming whiskey  it s a fine but rather pedestrian dram it s lacking that zip and sparkle that really makes you sit up and take notice not what i d spend thirty one of my pounds on don t get me wrong i d recommend buying a bottle if it s on special offer but i d say you could get quite a few far more exciting single malts for the same price  i m new to whisky i mean i ve tasted a bit of this a bit of that and i don t usually appreciate it enough to enjoy it but i tasted this one and i must say it s great i know nothing about whisky and it makes me want to know more and try other speyside whiskies i m really glad i bought it it s the best i ve tasted to far but i havent tasted many to be continued  cragganmore is a reliable all around whisky and a great introduction to the speyside style there s enough going on to keep experienced drinkers happy and it s smooth enough to entice new ones  newer whisky drinkers will undoubtebly appreciate more different tastes than most entry level scotches  nose intriguing unique nose slightly earthy to me very slight haypalate rich slight bite hint of sweetness taste slightly unfinished finish slight bite continues spice mix of pepper and cinnimon for a 12 year old pretty good if you can t afford 18 year old this is fine i am spoiled for the 15 year old scotches but was very interested in trying a speyside i can t wait to try one older  take instead johnny walker green label pure malt where it is an ingridient 
2073.0, beautifully smooth and delicious sherry cask whisky of the highest quality would highly recommend a great value 15 year old  still an enjoyable and reasonably priced 15yo but this latest release has a distinctly sulphur edge which i find challenging the rich raisin flavour which i normally associate with glenfarclas has given way to a more yeasty nose and the finish is quite bitter and walnutty i think i have a particular sensitivity to sulphur so a little goes a long way for me my husband enjoys sulphury quot dirty quot whiskies more than i do for that reason i would mark this whisky as a three stars out of five whilst he would probably give it four stars others may disagree but i suppose that 39 s the subjective nature of whisky  having tried many sherries the sherry influence on this whisky is very obvious toffee dark fruits nutty aromas one of the best 15 year olds available be careful when adding water as it drowns easily  phenomenal dram aged and robust yet sweet very long and complex  perfect 128076 for me enjoyed the moment but sound like its not for everyone 128580 regards oleg one of my favourit sherried whiskeys absolutely superb would recommend having it with just a few drops of water  dissapointed with this asked for a bottle for christmas and luckily got a miniature it was a struggle to be honest nose was lovely and sweet with the obvious sherry notes but the palette and finish was overtaken by a oaky harsh bitterness even a teaspoon or two of water didn 39 t help the bitterness unfortunately just not for me  the taste is generally good sweet and spicy but the alcohol smell and taste is dominating to much which is odd since it is quot only quot 46 and i have cask strength drams that i find less ethanol tasting would not buy again  over the years i have enjoyed many bottles of this 15yo it was a reliable 39 go to 39 for a rich sherried dram opened my new bottle last night to cheer myself up after all the depressing news about more lockdowns however i can 39 t say i enjoyed my dram as much as i was expecting it was a pale imitation of the 39 christmas cake in a glass 39 it used to be it didn 39 t seem to have the same richness or body or lingering finish don 39 t get me wrong it wasn 39 t a bad dram just not up to standard in my opinion  great sherried whisky this 15 yrs is a nice age for me quite smooth too and at price its a no brainer  interesting flavours quite unexpected as the 18year tastes quite unlike this one definitely tasting the walnuts lightly roasted memories of a dried up fruit cake with tons of fruit came to mind after getting over the strong nuttiness was excited to try this but now that i have had a sample bottle i might not see myself purchasing a bottle  lovely golden color sherry fruit vanilla old wood nose fruitcake sweet spice vanilla sherry flavour long length lingering and strong alcohol very moreish  i really like sherry whiskies and this hits the spot without being over powered by the sherry i did find i needed to add quite a few drops of water adding drop by drop really brings out the finer parts of this whisky kevdoncaster very nice sweet and spicy turmeric cinnamon allspice dried fruits christmas cake vanilla and sherry will buy again  tried this for the first time and wow i 39 m impressed for the money this is real nice full of flavour and texture sherry bomb loads going on strong finish for the price tag this is such great value  coats the tounge beautifully with sherry and raisin notes finish long and very pleasant at 163 50 a bottle this is a absolute steal  one of my fave 15 yr olds first whisky i ever really liked taste of 2 5 years ago on my single malt journey visited glenf distillery and it was grrrreat highly recommend older whiskies are good value too  i first tasted this whisky many moons ago at the distillery and over the years have had several bottles and always enjoyed it unsurprisingly then when i was looking for a tasty dram for hogmanay i bought another bottle but boy was i disappointed i poured a glass but it looked much paler than i recall stuck my nose it expecting the usual big sherry hit but got not a lot even the taste was a pale literally imitation of what it once was it wasn 39 t unpleasant but it wasn 39 t 39 farclas 15 it certainly was not christmas cake in a glass if i could i 39 d send this back and exchange for a glendronach or a mortlach at least these are still decent drams  this for me is the nicest of the regular core glenfarclas releases it tastes older than the 15 year age statement suggests it 39 s rich creamy and complex love it sherry and caramel on the nose delicious flavors of caramel dried fruit and chocolate on the palate nutty spicy and long finish rich and rewarding a nice winter dram absolutely stunning whisky pungent and mouthwatering sherry with dried fruit i could not stop nosing  noses and drinks almost like an 18yo age wood shavings sherry very soft mature malt with aeration marzipan forest funk very impressed needs a drop of water this but doesn 39 t take much recommend one fourth of a teaspoon  don t if you like your sherry and christmas cake go for glendronach 12 15 18 21 this just isn t what you re looking for  this is typical glenfarclas style bottled at a respectable 46 abv very descent whisky along the lines of the 17 and 18 with good sherry influence great if you like glenfarclas distillery and sherried scotch speyside is part of the highland region glenfarclas considers itself part of this also and you can taste this i consider glenfarclas aspeyside that is robust like a highland glendronach 12 15 18 21 offers this speyside sherried style with more refinement and elegance but glenfarclas 12 15 17 18 21 25 are of consistently high quality and undervalued i personally prefer glenfarclas 105 and 2004 cask strenght offerings in their core range below the 21 but to each their own glenfarclas 15 sets a benchmark it is well matured in high quality sherry casks and is just a nice full flavored dram in this style and age of whisky  opened this bottle and a few others when relatives came to visit even non whiskey drinkers had a few drams of this nectar those who say it 39 s a bad whiskey have serious problems with their taste buds one of the best i have ever tried  go for a glendronach glen garioch glenglassaugh or a glenfiddich even but don 39 t buy this this one tastes predominantly of alcohol the sherry influence to me is quite weak and very straight forward no complexity to be found here the finish is by far the most dissapointing of all it 39 s non existent i can 39 t get my head around the chaps 39 tasting notes this is by far the whisky with the shortest finish that i know of as someone who likes to enjoy a quality cigar with his sherried malt this was extremely dissapointing i ended up mixing half of the bottle with my evening coffee just to get rid of it 39 s contents although i do have to say glenfarclas 15 beats jameson for a decent irish scottisch coffee  disappointment at start but after initial opening and breathing in the bottle for three months now when 4 5 of the bottle is left this is finally opening up and turns up as a unique single malt complex christmas spices are there combining nicely with little bit of sweetness but with same price you can get deanston 9 year old 2008 which has some what similar flavor profile but is superior in terms of value for the money glenfarclas 15 yo is a fine single malt in itself but i expect more from 15 yo single malt and that 39 s why 3 stars from me  this is a great dram if you like sherry christmas cake gluhwein and strong yet sweet sherry better than macallan 12 or glendronach 12 on level with bunna 12  simplistic and overwhelming alcohol taste for me which is strange since i really enjoy glenfiddich 15  i can 39 t say much about the current releases but i picked up an older bottling pre 2009 swr labelling reading quot single highland malt scotch whisky quot rather than having quot highland quot listed first so this was likely distilled and put into casks back in the 39 90s at the latest and it is absolutely terrific plush rich and sherried whisky lots of caramelized sugars and fruit on the nose with candied raisins and sherry on the palate it 39 s a sweet leaning dram obviously but so beautifully balanced that it just works 46 is a nice abv to work with and a few drops of water and a few minutes in the glass open up this rich whisky very nicely i often think that 15 years is for many scotch whiskies really the sweet spot of age in a number of labels i prefer their 15 over both the 12 and 18 and here that 39 s also the case the glenfarclas 12 is very nice but the 15 is just sublime and i definitely prefer it over the 18 i will need to try some of the more contemporary bottlings to compare but this old bottle picked up is a real gem obscenely easy to drink  in these days buying a sherried single malt is like playing russian roulette glenfarclas 15 yo is really great malt when it 39 s not sulfured unfortunately nowadays demand is so high and sulfured sherry casks so common that even highly respected distilleries like glenfarclas can 39 t make it anymore only thing you can do is taste the batch first or buy quot bullet proof quot single cask sherry malt  great nose raisins dried citrus peel sherry wood spicy palate not too sweet more dried fruits nice sharp and spicy finish  simply lovely  a very nice one this for only 15 years old packs a punch at 46 and delivers with big flavours a bottle that should permanently be in your cupboard and great on a cold xmassy evening  nice flavor but not very complex  the last bottle i had of this approximately 6 months ago was so sulphured if such a word exists that it was rendered undrinkable as such i was left no other option than to give the bottle to somebody i don 39 t like if you get a good bottle this is a perfectly balanced whisky and a mainstay on my personal 10 10 list heavily sherried but not a monster and displaying a beautiful structure of malt nuts and dried fruits however if you get a bad bottle you better be as misanthropic as i am to get any sense of satisfaction out of it  this represents the best of and allthat is great about glenfarclas at 46 it 39 s got lots of bite but is richly complex with a beautifully lingering stimulation of chordi tympani i 39 ve been round many corners with whisky but this is the way the truth and the light  when i read the previous reviews i was concerned about buying this a lot saying it was great and a few saying it was vile i finally got it a few hours ago and cracked it open the first sip was the strong medicine taste but with a second sip and a few minutes setting it greatly improved i am glad i bought it  i got this at christmas hoping to enjoy the quot christmas cake quot flavours in the appropriate season but i was very disappointed it may be well sherried but that was completely buried under a pall of sulfur for me it dominated all other flavours on the nose and the palate i have man flu now so it 39 s getting used in hot toddys while my sense of taste is gone i just ordered on glenfarclas day so hopefully the the small bottle of the 105 will help to redeem the distillery  it does indeed need the touch of water to reveal it 39 s true beauty in doing so let it rest for a while at the very least 10 minutes to bring forth to the palate the golden smooth complex beauty a whisky for the sherry influenced lovers indeed  firstly the nose the smell of this is just amazing i would say one of the nicest i 39 ve ever had the pleasure of opening the drink itself is delightfully complex there is so much going on and yet it blends very nicely my only issue is the length of the finish it doesn 39 t stay and compared to the smell the taste i found to be somewhat lacking it 39 s there no doubt but compared to the thump in the face you get from the smell the taste is far too subdued for the price i don 39 t think you 39 ll do any better but it just seems a little lacking to quite get all 5 stars  sweet and rich i 39 m on my second bottle and it won 39 t last long  nose of heavy sherry on the palate i get orange and a little raisin long finish that i actually don 39 t care for too much so let 39 s add water for me 4 drops was perfect butterscotch it really opened up it is sweeter with water i am still struggling with the finish though  not a bad scotch lacks a bit of flavour for my liking tastes reminds me of a bourbon  just got this bottle and have been sampling it over the last few days i am relatively new to the scotch scene but have so far really liked the sherried expressions there was certainly a strong fruity nose to it which seemed different bananas dates the christmas cake everyone seems to bring up i suppose problem is i 39 ve never had christmas cake so that has not been helpful there is some citrusy note in the back too develops nicely in the finish where i taste some distant sweet tobacco since uncorking it has opened up a bit i am sticking with it a nice dram for sure  having been appreciating good single malt whisky for many years i was interested when i was given a bottle of glenfarclas 15 year old as a birthday present what a disappointment i don 39 t know what they put in the bottle but it certainly wasn 39 t 15 year old good quality whisky it tasted terrible either with ice or with water after two drinks of this whatever it is i felt ill and had to hurry to the bathroom as the quot whiskey quot had a need to come back up i have never in my life had a single malt scotch whiskey make me vomit needless to say i used the rest of the quot whatever it was quot to clean the sink with not worth rating  have not tasted as of yet bottle to bottle variation is bringing alternating joy and grief too inconsistent this has been both one of the most impressive and most disappointing wiskies that i 39 ve tried i 39 m a big fan of the sherried speysiders and was naturally drawn to glenfarclas 15 through the great reviews online the first bottle that i bought through master of malt was absolutely superb and i raved about it to all of my whisky fan friends so much so that i was bought a bottle by a friend for being master of ceremonies at his wedding when i tasted the bottle that i was gifted i couldn 39 t have been more disappointed it was nothing like the original bottle i bought non of the beautiful sweet rich flavour was present just a slightly musty boring whisky if you get a good bottle of this you 39 ll be blown away if not be prepared for disappointment  budget 163 35 163 50 yeslike speyside whiskey yesread on yesi am not a whiskey conniseuer but i do buy a lot of 163 35 163 55 bottles of speyside single malt amp so of that particular market i think i 39 m well positioned to offer some advice i 39 m essentially putting this dram up against similar offerings from balvenie amp aberlour at this price point that 39 s some stiff competition but this always wins the gold medal for me give it a try  i don 39 t know what people find so interesting to this one no clue if i had a bad batch but i tried many times to give it a chance to redeem itself without succeeding the nose get more appealing with oxidation but that palate is just bad i guess that if you like weak sharp and bone dry sherry give it a try  i found mine not being particularly dark in colour just slightly darker than the 12 yo its not entirely different from his younger brother i think its very similar but more intense and richer tasting it side by side with the macallan sienna i concluded i like this one better both amazing drams  beautiful complex rich and very satisfying dram for the money not sure you can do any better in this price bracket  all good whiskies are alike but great whiskies have there own special flaws that rise them to a higher level this is how i think of glenfarclas 15 it is just so good even its flaws the nose is rich sherry christmas w o being cumbersome the mouthfeel is like velvet than opens into fruity spiciness when water is added and testimony to its quality it can take water the bourbon influence is there and there is so much more it is just so damn easy to drink  batches vary from year to year but i always find this one consistently delicious can 39 t help but go back to it year after year one of my favourite whiskies  consistently a remarkable dram christmas cake etc just a very fine dram an absolute bargain at 163 50 my fav whisky pound for pound was the glendronach 15 when it was 163 50 but now this has taken the lead one everyone could love may need to explore more glenfarclas  nose butterscotch pudding

neat very sherried but water brings out the real bourbon influence reminiscent of bulleit rye sweet when neat but very astringent and complex with a good water helping this quot sherry bomb quot is about more than just sherry it does seem that most of the higher quality casks may be bourbon and that the bourbon part of this whisky is older than 15 years points 88 101  exquisite whisky with flavours reminding me of christmas time but certainly a whisky to be sipped all year round  loved this in the 3 cl sample butterscotch monster quite bitter and full after the sweetness passes great dram  the power chords on opening relax into a cascade of gentler and more subtle fruit notes after letting the bottle breathe for 48 hours some friends were visiting and one chap who professed to hating whisky and anything to do with it is now a convert to the taste of the grain bring on the 25 39 i can 39 t wait  i had purchased a couple bottles of this whisky simply because of the reviews i 39 d read i was not disappointed it is a bit thin for my taste however if it were more viscous it would arguably be my favorite of any whisky i 39 ve ever had the flavor is incredible and the nose is equally impressive it is just as the tasting notes describe  excellent fabulous nose and a massive long lasting aftertaste brill  this is no longer the sherrybomb it once was mom 39 s tasting notes above are quite a few years old glenfarclas today has more in common with say cragganmore or aberfeldy if you like sherried whisky there are 3 distilleries that deliver the goods these days glendronach glengoyne and bunnahabhain glenfarclas sits in the backseat except the 40 year old which is the best whisky i have ever tried  perfect if you want smooth juicy and a little sweet and what a great value  the christmas cake statement is indeed what i taste love it the sweetness the cherry perfectly balanced a lot better than the 12 year old which is also nice best one i had so far together with laga 16  let it age spot on advice rich thick sublime sweet sherry goodness fab stuff for the price go for it you won t be disappointed malt mates  a very high standard thick warm sweet i like a light dram first to set this bad boy into action great quality try it now  fab whisky was bought it for a bday and loved it so much we bought it for the father in law for xmas x master of malt 39 s description of 39 christmas cake 39 is spot on this is very rich sweet and delectable scotch whisky on par with say glenfiddich 15 was taken a bit taken back by its heavy sherry influence at first but with a wee bit of water it calmed down and i love it would absolutely buy it again  if you love ex bourbon barrel aged whiskies and ex sherry cask aged whiskies this is truly the heavenly balance to be honest i don 39 t know if they use ex bourbon barrels for this one but it 39 s not this lame 1st fill ex sherry cask prune juice to me it 39 s prevalent aroma on the nose is cheesecake yes it smells of graham crust not impossible with oak influences and well creme cheese the body is dark fruits with pleasant dark chocolate bitterness in the finish a bit of water brings citrus in the front nose wise  if you like the flavor of whisky aged in a sherry cask you will love this one i 39 m on my third or fourth bottle now it is one of my all time favorites it is well deserving of the high praise it receives there are only a handful of drams that get a 10 from me this is one of them  this is probably the whisky by which i judge the rest the very distinct glenfarclas taste is what i think of when i long for a classic speyside whisky when compared with its price this is definitely a 10 10 a must have for any whisky lover  best malt i have tasted for a while at a good price  really awesome whisky one of my favourites  simply the best whisky per price in the world enough said  firstly glenfarclas 12 is great but this doesn 39 t hit the mark typical speyside but you definitely can see the quality that you would expect from a glenfarclas i am hesitant to give low scores because i think they do so much so right but this one is not for me  we had the 12 yr old sunday night outstanding malt this scotch has a flavor to it cannot put my finger on going to pick up the 17 yr old i like older scotch this is considered one of the best distilleries in scotland and i agree a big 10  i can 39 t get over how great this dram has become since opening it at christmas it gets better everyday i want to buy another just to open it to the shoulder and let it sit for 3 months if you can let it sit you will be absolutely amazed  one of my favorites so far i 39 m still trying different distillery offeringsfrom various regions i love to take in each sip and let it slowly enlighten mytaste buds then swallow and enjoy the finish in my throat yes i like thiswhiskey very rich  absolutely beautiful the best single malt i have ever tasted  what can i say this is a whisky that every distillery strives to create a huge lovely piece of produce from this wonderful distillery this has taste complexity in the nose taste and finish i personally can 39 t wish for more in a whisky and for a 15 year old very affordable as are all glenfarclas expressions you 39 ll never find me without a bottle of this in my collection  firstly i have no clue what the reviewer mentioning quot phenolic quot is talking about not a hint of phenols when i 39 ve had the 15 this is a wonderful well balanced dram too often sherry maturation can overpower the whole experience but not in this case the sherry influence is opened into a wonderful wide and complex dram initially the sweet and smooth honeyed sherry leads to a clean fruit cake like palate and its lingers without exposing any bitter or awful surprises hard to put this down a bottle of this never lasts long in my home a must try malt in my book  one of my favs rich great amber color surprisingly better than the 21 year  first third of my bottle was a struggle strong confusing flavors the malt eventually opened up and became something fantastic it is intense powerful and opposite to smooth but in a good way besides the tasting notes above it has that really heavy thick mouthfeel to it which only adds to the drinking experience a must have fantastic whisky jh it 39 s not the stand out whisky i was anticipating based on reviews quite phenolic certainly sweet not really getting the fruit sherry etc 39 complex 39 overtones i also find the 105 a little disappointing frankly  this is a great whisky at an even greater price tastes like a more expensive dram this is one of the best sherried whiskies that i have tried it is smooth rich and well rounded i had to put my bottle away as i just couldn 39 t get enough will be ordered a new bottle very soon  absolutely gorgeous  don 39 t get me wrong i like it it really is good and smooth but it is also very simple i 39 d consider it a reference whiskey i purchased it as one of 5 different bottles i brought for whiskey tasting evening with friends everyone liked it but nobody found it in any way distinctive it makes it a safe purchase and a great start for tasting evening because it somehow lacks any interesting features only perhaps it 39 s on sweet side and everyone compares other whiskeys to it  brought a sample and loved it so had to get a bottle was a little worried due to some other reviews claiming that the bottle was very different from the sample none of that here fantastic stuff perfect for winter nights by the fire  this is the best by far the one from glenfarclas that tastes of christmas plumb pudding butterscotch lovley smooth drink 10 10 yes jim murray was right 95 100  i bought this on a uk trip as a present to myself and believe i did myself proud sherry nose dark chocolate and fruit palate and while i didn t see any other reviews mentioning this a drawn out oak finish  simply gorgeous you ll fall in love with it from the moment you first smell it definitely one to keep for special occasions if it lasts that long  faultless sample from mom then i bought the gift box edition with miniatures on opening the bottle i found the cork had a very strong pine to it which caused issues with the palate of the whisky i sent the bottle back to glenfarclas who gave me a replacement bottle but this again failed to live upto the sample tried originally  upon opening this bottle i would highly recommend letting it breathe for at least minutes with a splash of cool water you get juicy raisins and sweet honey on the nose in the mouth you get sweet fruit and a mouthful of almonds the finish is long and very sweet less peaty after drinking this i m afraid i m spoiled beyond repair and nothing will match the sensation i got when i took my first sip literally liquid cracked if there was ever such a thing  questo 232 un ottimo whisky uno dei migliori della sua categoria hi there although glenfarclas state highland on the bottle it s also very much a speyside whisky the macallan do the exact same thing even though both distilleries lie in the heart of speyside highland and speyside aren t mutually exclusive you see the entire speyside region lies inside the highland region which the scotch whisky regulations define as quot comprising that part of scotland that is north of the line dividing the highland region from the lowland region quot this map is also useful a href http www scotch whisky org uk understanding scotch whisky regions tours http www scotch whisky org uk understanding scotch whisky regions tours a the chaps at master of malt master of malts has categorized glenfarclas as a speyside but the bottle clearly states it is a highland single malt whisky this is also true of the glenfarclas 25 the 15 year old is an excellent malt with lots of flavor the sherry cask finish is definitely evident but not overpowering a fine malt and an excellent value  tried the dram of this original and it was superb bought a bottle of it and its taste nothing like i remember very disappointing  christmas 2013 the 15yo is fantastic smooth and rich another bottle yes  i m in heaven every mouthful is pure bliss highly recommended  highly recommended for everyone long fruity delectable  i bought a sulfur tainted bottle of the 15 year old from mom early 2013 so it would of been the late 2012 bottling that has this issue  not great but ok would i buy another bottle no how old are the reviews complaining about this  bought a bottle from mom a cpl weeks ago and this whisky has its good points but its just got too much of a sulphurous nose and taste for my liking and i wont be buying it again imho you are much better buying a bottle of glendronach 15yo if like myself you like the fruity flavours this is good stuff i m not even a huge fan of sherry d whisky compared to the glendronach this is more subtle and less overpowering with the sherry very complex deep winter fruits baked apples and rum soaked cherries all flavours over the underlining of sherry there are oak and nut notes whilst the nose doesn t really do the plate and finish justice i think that is a common quality of sherry d whisky and this is a great whisky more dark chocolate and raisin the finish is so long so so long a mouth watering whisky  full bodied with a nice dose of sherried sweetness malty tones and peaty flavours finish is long lasting very sherried sweet gently smoky and distinguished not my favorite but good for the price  really great 15 year old single malt it would seem they have an issue with consistency but i personally have not found this of the range i think the 15 best represents the house style and also the best value for money a real favourite and a must for lovers of sherried malts nose strongly assertive sherry characters present from the off powerful and richly creamy with a hint of the candied peel to come palate mouth watering richness like an old fashioned christmas cake pudding or a true sticky toffee due to a nutty quality element of sharpness as if from orange peel sherried raisins or cranberries complex but well balanced finish long a sustained feel of nuttiness and highly sherried fruit a hint of cloves and the warmth of a christmas fire that stays with you as above water draws out the sweetness but i feel loses some of the complex sherry notes and embracing wintertime cosiness that makes this a wonderfully nostalgic dram  the small amount of sulphur in the bottle of this i bought has killed what should of been and indeed what i was expecting of this venerable distilery so disappointed  fucking shite sulphur on the nose and on the palate bad cask  i first received a corked bottled inflated gray blueish cork strong nose of sulphur tastes like the nose impossible to recognize something else than this horrible smell master of malt cordially replaced this bottle thanks a lot for that the second bottle is equal to what has been said here a christmas cake seems older than 15yo spicy raisins wallnuts oranges etc it would have been perfect if only sulphur wasn t still there the sulphured taste is discernable among the others delicious flavors precisely on the final notes of the taste and on the finish the cork is intact on the second bottle it doesn t seems moldy like the first one so i guess this sulphur taste comes from the sherry cask quite disappointed by this dram  amazing carmello koala nose that tastes like cadbury s fruit and nut chocolate fruity and nutty the best way to enjoy this is to load up an eyedropper and drink it one drop at a time gives you time to explore the amazing cadbury s fruit and nut chocolate taste seriously have to try this a bottle lasted two years drinking it this way  this is just superb it screams sherry from the nose to the palate it is 46 so a tad on the strong side however this enhances its powerful flavour certainly one of my many favourites up there in my top 10 anyone would think that this is much older than a 15  ok so malt whisky is all about personal preference unless you think highland commisioner is better than 16yr lagavulin in which case you are just wrong so i m not going to preach to anyone about how good this is i like peaty smoke i really do but i ll always lean towards a sherried speyside first if you are like me then buy one of these this is without a doubt the best whisky i have ever had and i ve just finished a balvenie 15yr single barrel which was outstanding this glenfarclas is not like most sherried malts which are blended from a mixture of bouron or white oak whisky and sherried cask it spends it s entire mimimum of 15 years in sherry casks given that most of the whisky in here is much older than this it just has to be it s a heavy little beast simply stunning  just ordered my second bottle this stuff is gorgeous  tastes more like a middle of the road 12 y o single malt  one of my favourite speysiders an absolute fruitcake of a whisky as mentioned lovely rich hints of dried fruits sherry and christmas pudding ending with a velvety sweetness reminiscent of sugary dates unbelieveable stuff highly recommend this its an absolute bargain for the money a lot of whisky for your buck this is no entry level malt enjoy  15 yr old whisky i ve tasted i love my sherry cask whisky and this is by far the best buy without hesitation   the 15 year old from glendronach is even better i wouldn t want to be without either of them but if i was forced to pick one the glendronach would come slightly higher on my list  nose of spice caramels hints of maple delicate smokiness slight oakiness cork rope with a hint of minerality and pitch more wood expands on immediate taste with that warm mouth feel revealing sugary maple cork spiceiness with a full roundedslightly oily mouth feel this now reveals the yamazaki 12s woodinessand fiery tones  but nothing beside the 21  it sells out quickly enough on here  absoulutely sublime my current favourite unsurpassed for me at this price  absolutely sublime my current favourite unsurpassed for me at this price  fantastic dram you will not beat this for under 50 quid if you are a novice malt lover you should definitely try this this takes you to another level just so many flavours explode in your mouth without appearing overly complex fantastic stuff one to drink before you die  a wonder for a 15yo super rich sherry lovely chocolate mouth feel  not my favourite sherry cask single malt but its pretty good for the price it has attractive qualities but its nothing mind blowing  a perfect balance of richness and freshness this is one of the best and well balanced whiskies i ve tasted masterpiece  in my opinion glenfarclas 15 is better than its older brothers and good value for money glenfarclas is the best and the 15yo is my all time favourite visit the distillery and try the 15yo with a drop of spring water from the green burn heaven  and like butter fruit cake or indeed pannetone with raisins and fruit peel is the closest on my palate complex and enjoyable and i only had a sample dram onto the 21 year now  i love cakes and this one is the best what i ever had i can only image how taste 21 and 25 this 15 is great indeed oh men what a nose incredible  glenfarclas are definately one of the best this seems alot older than 15 though really complex my favourite winter warmer 
2077.0, i ve had this bottle opened for a little over a year now it is an enjoyable dram i m preferring the 2nd half of the bottle more flavor for whatever reason on the nose candied fruit and definitely cherry the sherry influence shines through a bit of a dry mouthfeel different to that of the 12 yo but pleasant taste with all spice quite evident a lingering slightly peppery finish  i 39 ve never understood why glenfiddich sell so much whisky i find it a bit meh i tried this 15 yo solera hoping to find something special while you can taste the sherry influence i just find it like the other glenfiddichs but with a sherry influence it wasn 39 t unpleasant just middle of road spicy with nothing particularly bad and nothing particularly exceptional its a safe middle of the road whisky perhaps thats why you can get it everywhere it must be popular or they wouldn 39 t shift it i personally find it a bit boring  nice smooth taste half the bottle was gone n no time wouldn t drink it regularly at that price but a nice dram  perfectly pleasant but without being anything distinctive i 39 d sooner go for the 12yr old over this  best i thought this was ok but balvennie double wood is better and therefore with the price in mind i probably wouldn 39 t get this again not bad though  what a crap for 15 years of age saw some good reviews and got 25 off the regular price so i thought i 39 ll give it a try but i am really disappointed it is quite bad and i would not recommend it  i bought it on sale with two glasses did not expect much from it but i have to say i was still a bit disappointed for a 15 year old malt it is just not expressive overall like 2 to 3 times less expressive than a glendronach or tyrconell sherry if i had to quantify maybe some time in the botlle will make it open up a bit for now it tastes quite bland and unexpressive even thought it 39 s pretty smooth and easily drinkable i 39 d recommend spending your money on something more authentic and flavorful  the 12 has been a staple of mine for years i was disappointed with the 15 year doing some soul searching after this one  nose wooded lemons palate the wood attacks first very dry before it opens to a peppered oaked sherry 160 after a seasoned oak pepper finish very good  boring and uninspiring but what would you expect from a 40 chill filtered added colour whisky designed for the mass market and glad i only had a sample beautiful notes of sherry apple and spices tastes like the fall season a touch too light for my taste but overall very nice love this picked it up for 163 40 full of sherry winter fruits berries amp winter spices cinnamon nutmeg etc has a thick luxurious mouth feel anyone into speyside whisky will adore this  this is not top of the range spectacular but it has plenty of interesting notes of spice and sweet and a hint of smoke from the age and it retails for a pleasantly non spectacular price you can 39 t go wrong with it more so because it 39 s produced in quantity by the glenfiddich boys despite the supposed individual cask selection so there 39 s consistency which a lot fail on a quality sherried dram this and out of a vat too these solera vats are very important to keep the product the same and the same is great a whisp of smoke in the finish along with oak and sherried spices a tang of orange peel too hard to fault at its price which for a 15 yr old is damn good struth its a lovely drop soothing refined and well priced one of my go to gentler malts  smooth easy drinking and refined complex flavours you ll never regret deciding to choose this whisky over something else in your collection  profumo intenso allo stesso tempo delicato ma deciso un ottimo dram un 15enne superlativo  each cask is hand selected by our malt master brian kinsman and chosen for its unique taste profile individual casks are then married in our solera vat a unique process where the flavours from each cask interact with each other to create a uniquely smooth and refined single malt a beautifully soft sweet single malt our select expression combines the refined taste of oak with the signature orchard fruit of the glenfiddich collection lt a href quot http www glenbraves com quot gt viski lt a gt  if you like speyside whiskies i 39 ll keep this short buy this it 39 s by far and away the best bang for buck whiskey on the market and considering you can normally find it for a little over 163 30 if you shop around it 39 s stunningly good value  wow this blew away my expectations thick it is like sippin egg white in a good fantastic way very nice flavor keeps you craving  one of the most comforting whiskys out there my go to after funerals 128521  picked up a bottle for 163 34 great value for money at that price easy drinking scotch i like it nose pineapple citrus lime butterscotch vanilla green wood indulgent taste sweet vanilla fruits dried fruit spices cloves cinnamon doesn 39 t last very long in the mouth sweet aftertaste a bit thin  smooth and sweet non whiskey drinkers have been converted after trying this  hot and smoky and a snip at 163 33 at sainsburys today  i have been drinking whisky since my late teens and am now 56 glenfiddich was always at home when i was growing up and i have always had a few bottles in my cabinet for the past few years i have been trying lots of different brands including some very expensive so called top brands this solera 15 is my staple go to whisky and the one i seem to choose over the 18 other brands i have it has a wonderful complex aroma and taste with a good long finish that i never grow tired of over the years i have come to realise that glenfiddich despite its size is and excellent and consistently high quality distillery something that lots of others can t aspire to excellent whisky from an excellent family owned distillery  an excellent whisky lovely notes of citrus and spice and tastes of fruitcake and christmas very smooth no harshness at all faint oak taste at the end i love this malt much prefer it over the 18 year old great price moorish lovely whisky smells so sweet definately made me think of vanilla and fruity christmas cake fantastic buy at 163 30 too 128077 127995  if you like christmas cake you 39 ll like this i may have even added a bit to the cake on my plate simply delicious for me this is christmas afternoon next to the log fire after an excellent lunch  sweet spicy warming this is one of my favourites i am sad i only got a sampler bottle on the hunt for a well priced full one  excellente malt one of my favourite  stunning one of my favourites a complex start of fruits so berries raisins vanilla and warming honey also noted oak sherry sweets the taste is dry salty spicy and rich a long smooth finish one or two drops for a creamy fudge flavouring  i don t normally pick up oak notes on the nose but i m adamant i can with this one also sweet on the nose once aired for a moment or two pretty oily on the palate with an oak kick plums and a hint of coffee in the back  without a doubt the worst whisky i 39 ve ever bought his younger 12 yrs old brother is way better than this one such a disappointment even old cheap j amp b has better rounded flavour rough unpleasant on the palette do not recommend  been a reader of the reviews on this site for a few years and using them as a guide prior to buying and wishing that i could get some of the flavours other people write about thus i have been trying to crack the art of tasting myself with limited success then on another visit to a bottle of this i got a pretty overwhelming hit of rich christmas cake pudding that was shortly followed by a lingering sweetness on a further glass those tastes came through faster and i felt i got hints of vanilla once a slight bitterness faded overall for the offer price of 163 30 i consider it great value for money  i love malts scottish irish japanese this is a good malt i wouldn 39 t pay more than 50 a bottle for it but if it can be bought on sale then it 39 s well worth it all malts are good some are just better than others i 39 d rate it 3 and a half out of five but would give it a four if bought on sale if you like sherry characteristics in your whisky you 39 ll like this one  i found this to be very plain it s decent but that s it some sherry influence but not as much as most sherried drams it is smooth but for the price there are much better options this just feels cheap and too watered down very average nothing special sticks out maybe if not chill filtered and at a slightly higher abv i think it would be much better than it is  nutmeg ginger and spice at first lots of cinnamon and cake develop mixing with scent of citrus as well very complex so many aromas develop splash of water and it develops further cream becoming evident with citrus sweet compotes oh don 39 t leave out the wood palate is sweet cake with dried fruits vanilla pod you 39 d hold on the tongue again wood and some leaves bitterness on the aftertaste dried figs  a nice smooth 15 year old definitely the citrus sherry and smoke in the nose but only got the sherry and fruitcake in the palate and a hint of raisins in the finish a decent whisky but wouldn t want to spend more than 163 35 for it  an superb whisky at this price highly recommended  any difference between solera and barrel select both are 15 years old with ice and or water or both gets a very bit turbid why satyu  great initial aroma this is overtaken by the quot heat quot of the creation enjoyable but unlike a really peaty malt eg laphroaig the delicious aromas do not seem to be sustained still a worthwhile snifter as you will realise i 39 m a convinced islander when it comes to whisky  the perfect speyside for my liking lots of flavor good finish and beautiful aroma  great taste mellow after taste a 15 year whiskey wow what would the 21 year taste like i feel an after glow makes ones cheeks tingle well done glenfiddich best regards gray i purchased this whiskey for 163 30 at sainsbury it 39 s like drinking pop what a fantastic whisky  fairly mediocre rough amp unrefined character hidden behind a sherry finish try before you buy a bottle to avoid dissapointment  apple and pear on the nose smooth and fruity on the palate with an easy finish this single malt is one to have in your inventory for sure fantastic whisky not only for the value but overall rich nose and a smooth sherry palate which i simply love many times more complexity does not mean better and this is just the case  i 39 m more a fan of campbeltown for the complexity in their whiskys but this is smooth and pleasant without that bit of harshness i 39 ve found in springbank 10 and 15 i 39 ll take this over macallan 12 as well because it has a nice bit of sherry from the sherry cask but its not overwhelming solid choice for 70 the bad reviews below are probably bourbon drinkers  not cheap but affordable smooth and mellow one of the best single malts i 39 ve had in a long time  this a great drink if you are new to single malts buy this and an ardbeg 10 to choose your direction the other thousands of whiskies takes a lifetime  wouldn 39 t recommend it has quite a strong alcoholic taste to it very little else reminds me of my broke student years getting drunk on cheap whisky  unrefined tastes amp feels like a young whisky with no distinct character generally disappointing  possibly my favourite speyside nicer than the 18 and distinctly richer than the 12 very smooth always laugh at americans reviewing whisky see review quot nothing burger overpriced quot below compared to what you pay for the garbage produced by their country their criticisms are laughable  love it of the glenfiddich offerings the solera reserve is by far my favourite  very friendly smooth and approachable for beginners you can 39 t go wrong with this unless you 39 re trying for something complex it 39 s not bland it just isn 39 t super interesting if complex and interesting is what you 39 re looking for try a few drops of water in it and see it open up it 39 ll be a little sweeter and a lot more interesting  innocuous no kick no character nothing literally to write home or a friend relative or even a whiskey review website about fairly smooth yet utterly unmemorable bought for 75 worth maybe 25 huge ripoff  the nose constantly changes as it sits in the glass over 15 30 minutes which is really interesting on the palate loads of dried fruit orange and toffee it 39 s delicious but the mouthfeel is weak a non chill filtered version would be very special indeed  wonderful quot smooth quot and quot rich quot are words that will often appear in whisky reviews but for this offering from glenfiddich i can 39 t think of any more apt words to describe it the sweetness is the full and rich kind with those sherry bourbon caskings offering up some fruitcake christmas cake flavours but stopping short of cloying or sickly the finish is also reasonable and remarkably smooth although this could easily appeal to whisky fanatics i would also heartily recommend this to beginners or as one to offer those who wouldn 39 t normally make scotch their first choice normally that would be damning with faint praise but it 39 s universal appeal simply stands as a testament to how well made this is simply excellent i would struggle to think of a better all rounder to have around so much so i went and bought a second standby bottle  this is the whisky i recommend for everyone who is new to scotch and i mean that in a very positive way it is extremely smooth very delicious and quite easy to drink a classic speyside though i am not new to scotch i like it a lot it is a non challenging whisky for the times you just want to relax  che dire veramente un cult questo glenfiddich 15 anni solera al palato 232 morbito con note di agrumi giusta profondit 224 e lascia lo spazio all 39 immaginazione dei pi 249 conditi sapori intenso e morbido ottimo  smooth with a subtle sherry taste  this is a whisky that i really should buy more it 39 s probably the best one out there at this price only problem with it is that it 39 s 40 other than that this is awesome so much sweet sherry and orange peel with raisins and spices super smooth definitely don 39 t add any water and since the whisky in their solera keeps getting older this whisky gets better every time i buy it no wonder glenfiddich is so successful amazing whisky at a reasonable price cheers the sugarbear whisky eccezionale morbido al palato retrogusto fruttato un grande whisky  it 39 s all to easy to forget about how good glenfiddich is with all the other names trying to entice us but this is quite simply a great whisky to be honest it 39 s been awhile and i 39 d forgotten what a beautifully smooth fruity dram this is the nose is sublime the taste just what you want from an urbane speyside and the finish leaves a perfect warmth as another contributor said at a time when so many whiskies are nas and rather poor in quality give yourself a treat and go for this one the only thing to make it better would be non chillfiltration and 46 but then it wouldn 39 t be this whisky  first glenfifdich i have tried and no complaints i 39 ve yet to find a whisky that didnt like me  at a time when whiskies prices are going up while the quality seems to be going down it 39 s good to see glenfiddich are bucking the trend the 15 year old solera vat has always been good but the later versions are even better thick rich juicy and utterly delicious the finish is so moreish too this reminds of highland park 12 back when it was good whisky before the dark times before the empire before all the whisky wouldn 39 t tell us its age and doubled in price buy plenty of this this is simply the best whisky on the market at this price i intend to get half a dozen because value like this won 39 t last in today 39 s whisky market wait till the chinese find out about this stuff and ditch their overpriced generic johnny walker blends oh boy  what a great scotch sweet deep rich and smooth i taste a deep flavor of dried fruits and a hint of honey again smooth you can 39 t go wrong with glenfiddich the 12 yr is solid too but the solera gives you more 39 depth 39 in flavor when it 39 s on 39 sale 39 i always grab a bottle it 39 s worth it  i denifintely find mild smoke in it whiskyexchange rates it at 0 smoke weird  sweet very smooth and probably the nicest whisky i 39 ve tasted for me it 39 s perfect  great dram one of the best single malts money can buy an absolute must for single malt drinkers  on first pour a sweet smooth woody christmas cake of a whisky with quite a dry finish with very little oxygenation the wood and dryness dissipate and the whisky sweetens and mellows a very nice characterful whisky and pretty good value for money  not a cheap whisky at around 163 35 00 a 70cl bottle but still superb buy it taste it love it it 39 s glenfiddich always going to be a truly superb whisky tby  very smooth recommended if you drink with your girl rich aroma and taste my rating 95 100  a hint of belgian waffle and citrus in the nose the palate is mildly smoky round and tasting of dried fruit with a strong vanilla to caramel sweetness in the finish with a hint of oakiness tried this during a 2016 romp around the highlands and was pleased to see it in the advent calendar  i normally go for peaty but thought i 39 d try this one for s change very rich smooth with an oak amp raisin aftertaste it will definitely serve well over christmas i just wish i had a roaring log fire to sit in front of while drinking it  the solera vat is what makes this special i have had several of these and all vary in nose and palate due to the s v ever changing top aromatic notes are sweet honey dried dark fruits and toffee fudge in the back with a tiny dribble of distilled water it explodes into christmas cake i can nose this dram for hours if i had the time and the notes keep changing very sherried in the palate by itself it is a tad bit dry in the finish but it pairs magically with dessert cr 232 me brulee cheesecake or spongecake w fruit drizzle it is a staple of my whisky cabinet and always will be  personally i am a lover of all things smokey briney and oceanic i love scotchey scotch if that makes any sense the glenfiddich 15 is none of these things but it is quite good in its own right i just cracked and am enjoying my first pour as i write this this whisky has a velvety rich mouth and a very spicy almost christmassy nose it is a fairly american tasting whiskey in many ways but decadent and impressively flavorful not what i was hoping for but not a disappointment either definitely worth the money to try at least once  hard to beat at this price nice and smooth this one is very similar to balvenie 16 yo but better price and lower age  not a scotch for mixers a big soft entry that will be hugely welcomed by those stepping up from the 12 year old a soft sherryness spicy and complex round full with lovely fade away slightly bitter with peppery vanilla might be longer on the middle but the finish makes up for this thins too much with water goes a bit sweet then bitter worth revisiting i keep a bottle  light honeyed palate delicate with a hint of fresh mint leaves develops in mouth with wood amp chocolate slow spiced amp serried finish adding water brings out fresh fruit notes of a apple amp peach bit overall prefer drinking it neat  very smooth recommended for everyone this is an excellent whisky at a nice price point it is smooth and delicious i don 39 t quite comprehend an oregon pine tun but it works quite well  one of the best whiskies i 39 ve ever tried love it  the terminology on the masters of malt site says quot christmas pudding quot i would have to completely agree the flavors in this dram remind me of spicy sweet potato pie pumpkin spices minus the pumpkin this amazing 15 yr old is so affordable and absolutely unique with such a great holiday evening by the fire profile buy it get your best friends and family over and enjoy a warm evening together  probably the best single malt produced very smooth my go to scotch smooth and easy to drink no trace of spice quite alright good place to start if you are curious about single malt scotch you might want to evolve to something else after this one  superb by far the best bang for the buck among a type of whiskey that by nature can put a dent in the wallet scotch whiskey in general is something that most of us choose to pay the extra expense as it really is worth it and so enjoyable i have had the privilege of sipping the really high dollar stuff and it is better but not 300 bucks better not even close gf 15 is my personal selection it really comes down to what you enjoy in a single malt so disregard what others say and keep trying different types and go with what you enjoy in a scotch you will find you tastes and preference evolve and change as you yourself age one of my favourites  easy drinking malt slight suggestion of smoke on the nose i can definitely taste the sweet sherry for an easy drinking quality malt this is the one  my first venture into a higher quality of scotch i am loyal to a fault and now i am not only a solara reserve fan but truly a glenfiddich man period  i like this best of the regular glenfiddichs and where i live it is 15 cheaper than balvenie this is my any day whisky  i enjoyed this one better that the 12 and 18 year honey and vanilla  beginners dram  liquid gold if you like sherry bourbon taste in your sm then the balvenie doublewood is obvious the better choice  nose is a little sweet and alcohol eventhough its only 40 it smells alcoholic other than that very little smell taste is weakly sweet not really much taste at all opens with kind of a aspartame sweetnes which fade away quickly the most one dimmensional scotch ive had in a while reminds me of glenfiddich 12 which was the second scotch i tasted never found any taste in that either pouring this tastless drink out and getting a bottle of lagavulin on the table instead  i agree with the tasting notes by the chaps at master malt up to the finish which i find to be apple dominant and oaky complex and long an enjoyable beverage  sherry cinamon honey almonds all combined wisely for this nice serious malt full body long finish  i bought this bottle as a treat for myself on opening the bottle found a very pleasant aroma and was indeed very soft onthe palate but after a few drams found the after a bit to much like jack daniels it could be me but i would recommend this vintage to anyone  smooth spicy and sweet this is a great whisky that is hard to find fault with especially considering the price as good as the 18 no but for the price difference it 39 s pretty darn equal fill a glencairn glass to the widest point add a sliver of ice and let it melt and cool the whisky a touch the splash of water really opens this one up pick up a bottle and enjoy it  in my 60 years of sampling and enjoying a vast offering of whisk e ys i have settled on the glenfiddich 15 it embodies a lot of sweetness of fruit with a lazy bite on the palate best served in modern heavy bottomed but non round glasses pre chilled and washed by three ice cubes battles won were celebrate with this  there are times when i go at my bottle and it is lovely rich florid honeyed sweetness with a long pleasant finish inexplicably there are other times when i give it a go that the finish isn 39 t nice at all like right now like the reviewer below i get an unpleasant bitterness on the finish or what might even be described as a chemical saccharine over sweetness that coats my mouth and that 39 s just not pleasant at all i can 39 t explain it  the glenfiddich 12 was for a long time the most accessible single malt as it was in amongst the blends and so when you know nothing you see single malt and pick that one up it 39 s ok and i like the sherry cask varieties with minimal peat smoke so the 15 year old is a great next offering i get the bourbon and sherry notes for sure a nice one  i just tried my first single malt last week and it was the glenfiddich 15 solera i enjoyed it a great deal i also had a chance to try the macallan 12 which i really liked looking forward to learning more and enjoying more single malts  nice dram but like review below very bourbon nose with bitterseeet aftertouch  like i said a nose similar of that jack daniels much richer on the pallate has a chocolate salty aftertouch nice dram this is truly amazing i had 4 drams with a slice of chocolate and i changed from beer to scotch from that night  i decided to pick up a bottle after seeing some positive reviews this cost me 163 37 which i could argue whether or not was too much at the end of the day i bought it so i obviously felt this was justifiable the nose gives a a sweet sherry sent i get a slight hint of spices in there as well the palate is spicy with a slight sweetness to it it is very pleasent to hold on the tongue a slightly thicker more oily texture than a lot of other single malts the finish is fruity spicy and welcome a great single malt to help convert your friends this does have caramel colouring but i don t find that such a big deal  one of my favorite whiskies this is a regular whisky in my collection always on the shelve it has already been said in other reviews but the 15y is better than the glenfiddich 18y this whisky probably has the best value for money than any other whisky  trying to compare this to kirklands 18 speyside single malt scotch whiskeyvery good but i find kirklands nicer i prefer blended scotch but recently have been trying single malts i enjoy jw black so based on some reviews i tried a lagavulin and don t care for it however i figured i should try one more single malt before shunning them the glenfiddich 15 is good very smooth and has convinced me that i should continue exploring single malts that being said this is the first scotch that when i drank it reminded me of a bourbon i was expecting a bourbon flavor because the bottle said it s matured in sherry bourbon and new oak but not that pronounced not that it s a bad thing cause bourbons are tasty but i haven t experienced that before and don t know how i feel about it i only say that because i can buy maker s mark for half the price so in closing it s a good whisky and i seemed to have found a single malt that i enjoy but it s too similar to a bourbon and for that reason in my opinion it s a bit overpriced i will enjoy drinking this bottle but don t think i ll purchase again  there was a disappointing bitterness on the tail probably one of the least attractive whiskies i have had over the years  i have currently 6 bottles in rotation chivas 12 chivas 18 jwb 12 glenlivet 12 glenfiddich 15 and laphroaig 10 and have to say that if i compare all 6 of them which is interesting glenfiddich 15 wins at least for me for the grain single malt mixed super high quality whiskies chivas 18 is waaayy better then chivas 12 but i am not sure its worth the price tag difference especially if you are on short budget jwb 12 is on par with chivas 12 there are just days when i prefer one over another and wise versa if you only have money for one go with chivas 12 as for laproaig 10 i would say that bowmore 12 is way better my next planned purchuse is glenlivet 18 and bowmore 12 and laphroig going out from the rotation and this glendfiddich 15 with its funny cheap price will be forever in my rotation  this is a wonderful whiskey it help convert me from a bourbon man to a scotch fanatic highly recommended  not the most complex of whiskies but extremely drinkable and excellent for the price  great value for the money forgot to score it  this comes from someone who has a regular bottle of dalmore 18 at his home if you see this scotch pick it up or you re missing out on something beautiful  absolutely fantastic whisky great value for money and so so dangerously drinkable will be ordering many more  my wife bought me this glenfiddich 15 for christmas and i couldn t leave it alone a superb scotch whisky must admit as an ulsterman my favourite regular tipple is jameson and i could never understand what all the fuss was about scottish highland whiskies my rare exception was to a bottle of good old dimple however this glenfiddich 15 definitely has made me review my opinions beautiful full flavour strong but doesn t catch the back of your throat and a warm very pleasant aftertaste perfect well done to the master distiller  after deciding to take the plunge into the world of single malts i started with a 375ml bottle of glenlivet 12 while it was good it was taking the palate some getting to used to and wasn t quite i d take to whisky fully while at a local pub they had a good selection of scotch at reasonable prices order a glenfiddich 15 and to my surprise it took and was able to sip and savor neat and fully enjoy it without the feeling of quot forcing it quot picked up a bottle and couldn t be happier well worth the cost over something still considered a decent whisky in the glenlivet 12  2nd time was much more familiar the with taste which sends all of us for coming counting feel better  it was very good night with my first ever try yesterday friends enjoyed as well as i did  the glenfeddich 15 is amazing for the money it cant be beat  not a huge fan of the 12yo but this stuff is great nicely sherried woody well balanced much better than both the 12yo and the 18yo recommended  this is so worth the money it s one fine whisky anyone starting out should pick up the 12 year old glenfiddich and highland park 12 then this  this is a well balanced product the alcohol hit doesn t linger the cask flavors are evident at different temperatures and dilutions out of habit i always drink my scotch on the rocks as the ice melts the texture and flavors change revealing more of the craft flavors definitely one to have on the shelf when you want to spend a while sipping from a glass on a quiet evening even my picky friend who readily pays much more for a bottle of scotch stated he was getting a bottle of this he had avoided it due it being a 15 yr and having a lower price but this bottle taught him that a 15 yr at a lower price does not always compromise enjoyment  i ve always like glenfiddich but expected a tad more from this than it delivered try the 18yo instead  i should have rated before enjoying the product  very good pleasantly long finish the right flavor complexity makes it hard to spend more on older single malts  good stuff highly recommended great quality av rampersad trinidad west indies  have a go amp you will be pleased with this well done the boys at glen f this is a beautiful whiskey full of flavour and very well rounded i d certainly recommend it to anyone it is complex and full bodied but i do find that it s more rounded than i d like i prefer whiskey with a lot of character certainly the sort of drink you could give to guests without any worry of complaints though  very smooth for malt  while the 12 yo is a kid s drink the 15 is a grown up drink even though it s not as good as i rate it i m biest because i really like it it s very smooth packs a punch and has a great taste not as complex as you will expect though but i don t mind that great quality whiskey a 86 5 100 from me i really liked this one particularly recommended for my money the 15 is the best out of the core glenfiddich range more complex and full bodied than the 12 and better even than the 18 if you want a quality glenfiddich look no further  much more than i thought guddos grants much better than 12yo i like it  this is one of the best 15 years malt i ever taste palate is quite rounded like dancing in your mouth nice single malt scotch for this price  the price is good and the taste is much better  which is 43 and a 1 l solild bottle this whisky is an incredibile combination of delicate fruityness and bourbon casks freshness though i am an ardbeg drinker this dram is always on my whikyshelf  yes it is a manufactured malt in the sense of using the solera vatting technique but for all that it is a superbly rounded and balanced malt it is lush syrupy and rich and very dangerously drinkable it is also a bargain at this price 
100200.0, smooth fruity whisky with a character taste gets better few days after opening the bottle one of my favourite during summer  decide to take a break from my usual islay whisky and i am glad i did very smooth and rich in fruity flavours the distinct oak on the finish is very much to my liking this will not be my last bottle  very good sweet fruity and easy to drink good nose good taste very smooth will buy more of this good stuff  this is a truly great taste experience i put this near the top of my single malt choices it 39 s gentle on the tongue yet has a very distinct flavor very enjoyable drinkable not a challenge to to quot get used to quot also very reasonably priced  man i ve been neglecting to try this since i thought the double barrell was just another gimmick and relentlessly tried other brands to my disappointment finally at a whim because of short notice i bought this and am quite surprised and actually like it better than the original because the original seemed like it had more bite as if a bad batch but this is smoother and fruiter and the same quality if not better  another off my list glenmorangie or glenffidich in future real departure from the original soft rounded flavour now overly smoky peat taste none of the vanilla richness sweet fruity smooth it appeals to my taste  an excellent all rounder fits to anyone who likes sm floral fruity and not so complex but has a character i like it very much  i bought a bottle on offer and am pleased i haven t paid the full retail price i was expecting a much smoother dram but i found it very harsh overall very disappointed with this i ll come back to it in winter to see if it s more palatable  fantastic nose smooth rich buttery taste swills like nectar but with a lasting lingering alcohol burn better with a few drops of water 4 5 excellent smooth highland malt love the aftertaste sort of flowery  nice
79710.0, the best 18 single malt the half star reviews bellow are unfair it is true the prices went up but that does not warrant a half star review aberlour 18 is a solid 89 points in my books nose orange sherry notes cocoa oak palate orange ripe fruit honey spice oak tea finish short to medium smooth  nose constrained and controlled entrance odour carpeted mild scented sherry palate there is a slate sourced serving undercurrent chalk after orange sponge carries you out but barely  this is decent whisky but no more than that add to that the high price and for the outrageous bottle sizing and there 39 s no way i can recommend it against a host of far better value alternatives  not many years ago this aberlour was one of the cheapest 18yo bottlings on the market look at it now well over a ton and only 50cl i can only imagine a previously very good whisky has become an astronomically good one aberlour you reap what you sew  aberlour 18 is an outstanding whisky i have lived in scotland all my life and it is considered to be one of the best in speyside  a stunning smooth whisky with hints of honey and rose on the nose toffee flavours over vanilla with overtones of orange peel to finish  mental price that the quality just doesn 39 t justify as for the smaller bottle less said the better there are many many better 18 year olds for a much cheaper price out there you should simply buy them instead  aberlour 18 is an outstanding whisky i have lived in scotland all my life and it is considered to be one of the best in speyside  700ml to 500ml and same price was my go to whiskey till now aberlour you suck  great whisky for the old price that is new price is not for real and it is not their deal thing anymore aberlour is now going for the single cask over priced bottlings 13 14 16 17 19 years the 19y single cask cask strenght is doing over 250 euro let them do let us go to the i b 39 s  hahahahaha so many better whiskeys out there i bought 3 bottles of the aberlour 18 for 55 for a 70cl this was a long while ago i m still on my first bottle b c it s so bland compared to almost any bothered sherried whiskey out there good luck aberlour hell bring on the bourbon it s better   163 117 for 50cl of chill filtered e150 added 18 year old bottled at only 43 yeah good luck with that you could buy three bottles of 70cl craft presented and far better malts for the same price mental x very overpriced i still have a 70cl bottle in my collection which i bought on 60e there is lot of better options at 270e l pricepoint  what is this this whisky is only worth half of this asking price if it was in a 70 cl bottling the value on this is absurdly poor just look at the price volume and specit will be a stuck bottle good luck to aberlour in their business ventures as with such a good competition from glenfarclas glendronach glenlivet and many others who pricing their product responsibly as for me im not buying
82457.0, a superb whisky for the decerning drinker this is my go to choice for something special personally i find some of the older more expensive malts too intense but here at 15 years in the wood price point complexity and intense flavours are to my mind in perfect balance only downside it 39 s just so drinkable it never seems to last very long if you have the original revival i will buy the bottle from you regardless it is that good perhaps better than the parliament which is still top 3 for cherry scotch 39 s this version of the revival is not as well done it does not feel as well aged or produced it honestly is not as good and i wish they had changed the name and kept the mystique of the quot original quot revival rather than used it for marketing hype still a good drink and for the price an amazing cherry whiskey sweet and light but not what i hoped for which is a shame back to the parliament or the allardice if it is not available  i 39 ve had several bottles of this now and it has become my favourite if you like sherry cask whisky to my mind this is the best at the price point lovely oily texture with chocolate orange and burnt sugar flavours i 39 m no expert and i 39 ve never tried the pre 2015 bottling but this is a superb whisky  some character has gone the direct fire stills will be missed however it impresses me how well this iteration matches the 39 original 39 spirit lighter smoother and slightly less of a woody tang  i have been a single malt drinker for several years the twelve year old glendronach is very good i was reloading my stock and my local scotch expert suggested that this was his favorite i must certainly agree that this is a terrific scotch is without a doubt my favorite it has all the attributes of the 12 year original but smoother and more refined albeit at a bit higher price but well worth the pleasure of drinking it we are talking aberlour macallan dalmore the balvenie talisker and oban good stuff  rich dark malt with a taste of heaven really good liquid easy to drink and enjoy  very smooth sherry is everywhere like a mad sherry trifle brown sugar and a bit of orange in the finish too a marvel and a huge step up from the 12 has to be 5 starsstruth the old 15 i thought i heard it had 20yr blended in it that explains why this new one is lighter and thinner than previous expressions  i 39 ve just opened my first bottle of the 15 and i 39 m already considering buying another bottle i 39 ve wanted to try the glendronach 15 for a while now having experienced many varieties of whisky and knowing my palate i 39 ve tried all the main expressions of glendronach and loved them all this one however is my favorite it is very similar to the 18 with big sherry notes but there is something almost sugary about this whisky everything is chocolatey coffee beans cocoa with a punchy vitality to it full of life i rate it a clear 9 10 for sherry enthusiasts this is a must have in your collection don 39 t think about it buy yourself a bottle  amazing and delicious  the whisky club in australia found the last stock of the original in mexico and are selling this now  i bought the original and loved it bought this new release when it came out i cracked the bottle and shared the first tasting with a fellow whisky enthusiast i think this is still a fantastic whisky my friends comment quot this is one smooth dangerous whisky quot  compared this side by side to my 2013 bottling new version is much lighter much thinner much sweeter and far inferior aside from that the fact that they changed the recipe but kept the name is deceitful of glendronach 39 s new management   they will never be reached you do not praise the new things i would say it is still a top quality sherried dram the old revival was slightly better but wasn 39 t that older than its 15 years age statement this is new revival is simply a top quality 15 year old sherried dram and i am just waiting for it to come back into stock again  i hear what other people say by saying pay that bit extra for the 18 however they are completely different whiskys if you have the 18 then defo buy this to see what glendronach also offer with a mix of olorosso and px sherry casks for 163 62 it 39 s money well spent no product is ever going to be the same as its predecessor or successor over a period of time it stands to reason that there will be variances some time for better some time for worse in this case i cannot personally make an assertion as to the providence of the previous offering of this article what i can say is that this particular incarnate is i daresay blooming moreish  yes its very different from the old version you can really tell the dufference when you compare them side by side time changes i never got to taste the old bottling but this is a damn good 15 torn between this and the glenfarclas 15 definitely depends on mood between the two but if i 39 m being honest the glenfarclas 15 is a tad bit ahead  this is a rich beautiful dram people should not compare it to the previous revival as this is a completely new recipe as we were told on our recent visit to the distillery it is packed with flavour with a silky caramelised finish top notch whisky damn good  waited for this for a long time and it s delicious different from the older version but still very good too many people are trying put this on the same pedestal as the old 2015 version before even trying it as with all glendronach this is a very pleasant dram in its own unique way those that care that it s not as old as the previous bottling are just or as rich and full are just talking huff those people are just moaning that they are not getting age for the money anymore not true whisky connoisseurs if you ask me appreciate it for what it is and stop all the whining great whisky  what has happened to the revival i have been counting the days until i got to drink one of the great whiskys again even with the 163 20 price increase i thought it would still be worth it what a disappointment it s not in the same league as the revival of a few years ago  having never tried the previous version that is so fondly looked upon this is a fresh review with no prejudice of the older one i find it excellent for a 15 year old it drinks much older than the label regardless rich px and chocolate notes some nuttiness and christmas pudding i would highly recommend this to any fan of the sherried highland or speyside profile  wonderful whisky make sure you grab a bottle while they are around decent dram not a patch on the old one sadly oh well we will always have the memories of 2015  pleasant whisky completely different to the old cult bottling of lt 2015 mind don t expect great things i recommend the 18 year old alladice over this  buyer beware not the same whisky as the old lt 2015 bottling much younger and not as full as the last old bottling still a pretty decent whisky but 163 62 is taking advantage of the formers reputation my recommendation is pay the extra for the 18 year allardice 
1921.0, i 39 m a fan of speyside single malts yet this one was underwhelming to me it 39 s very similar to the less expensive highland park 12 in some ways it 39 s bested by the former if you 39 re a fan of either a massive step up is craigellachie  absolutely love this malt my go to for good honest value for money whisky when on special offer which it occasionally is  very smooth and easy to drink this is really well balanced and subtle whisky one with hints of orchard fruit cream and smoke but nothing overpowering the senses it is very pleasant and probably one i 39 d by as a 39 go to close whisky to suit almost any occasion  ya beauty smooth amp not complex very good one for beginners  extremely pleasant very smooth to my palate a taste to cherish  pleasant nose of honey and lemon palate a little flat but pleasant with some hints of black pepper slight bitter finish but still pleasant  received this as a gift from my lovely wife but wasn t too excited about trying it i was happily surprised great nose great taste great bit of smoke at the end that was just enough to be pleasant lost a bit with water and i wouldn t advise adding any due to the low abv but otherwise a very very nice drink this is definitely a bottle i will keep in my cabinet regularly  smooth great flavours cardhu 12 has been my favourite malt since the mid 1980 39 s  nice smooth dram more pears than apple didn t get any smoke that the description stated was expecting well a bit more tbh i ve had gold reserve several times and find that has a toffee apple taste that lingers found the pear aftertaste doesn t stay that long it s a nice dram great for those new comers to whisky but with the gold reserve usually 3 5 pounds cheaper and as low as 163 25 when on offer i ll be sticking to that  i just bought my first bottle of cardhu and am surprised at how smooth it is very nice whiskey indeed it could become my go to  got 3 bottles in my cabinet had them 10 years smooth and delicate perfect for a summer evening with the one you love  normally i don t like scotch whiskey i prefer rye but i got a bottle of cardhu for christmas and i actually enjoyed it i highly recommend it if you don t like a bold scotch it s smooth  this is my first single malt scotch whisky i actually have laphroaig 10 and talisker 10 but couldn 39 t dare getting into single malt world with them so i bought this bottle to train myself before opening those bottles i know they are not in the same league but i couldn 39 t get any peat smoke or taste however i quite liked it it is really smooth and easy to drink smells and tastes like apple cider  very smooth one of my absolute favourites and i find it even better than the gold you will want more than one glass  wasn 39 t going to try this as i was told it was made by jw not a fan glad i was talked out of it with a tasting initial nose of honey smooth on the palate with a great slightly peaty finish i 39 m pretty bloody happy with this one  very smooth and at a great price to me it 39 s like having a glorious chat with an old dear friend nothing to be apprehensive about after 25 years warm and mellow allways look forward to the time together and to the next time excellent value  this was my first ever aged single malt which was bought for me as a gift having always been a bourbon drinker i loved it and the next whisky i bought was a laphroaig 10 from there i 39 ve tried almost every expression of islay and rarely dipped back into anything else i thought for a change i 39 d try a bit of nostalgia and picked up a bottle of this to be honest its easy to see how i fell into islays its 39 s lovely and sweet which most islays lack its a great alternative bottle along with and aberfeldy 10 for an islay lovers drinks cabinet  this whiskey is smooth with a little hint of honey sweetness but a somewhat acidic finish which made it a little sweet and sour perhaps some will like that but for the same money i would opt for the brilliant balvenie doublewood 12 which offers a similar flavour profile but truly almost melts in your mouth same price  if you are a beginner who wants to pick a single malt to start with this might be the best choice at a very reasonable price very balanced you can easily recognize its tastes also not a bad one for sophisticated drinkers  very drinkable and easy althought the complexity is closed to quot zero quot the price range is good and you have what you deserve for this amount of money i will not buy again there is really nothing special about it a kind of glenfiddish or craggenmore whisky  didn t read the reviews before trying caught the sweetness but couldn t put anything in my mind i covered one nostril and nosed it with the other pears zappel came to my mind the finish is slightly smokey and yes could also taste a bit of peat but i did drink this right after the lagavulin 16 so  just recently returned from scotland had the opportunity to sample the 12 and 18 year old cardhu both are very nice seems peculiar but i think i liked the 12 year a little better prices back here in the us beat the scotland prices and the bottles in scotland are 700ml where here they re 750ml i will definitely be purchasing this on a regular basis  i first bought the cardhu in west africa in 1966 and this has been my all time favourite malt whisky  lovely gentle taste that lingers on the tongue and evokes memories of many a pleasant day spent in scotland just found a bottle of 12 year old 70cl cardhu gift set with 2 glasses for 25 euros in eleclerc france looking forward to a drop tomorrow absolutely lovely e elegant rounded excellent to newbie i personally loved this whiskey for the price it 39 s very good and better than many other 12 year old bottles available yes you can probably find something better if you spend another 30 or more but that goes with most bottles it 39 s very smooth for a 12 and very drinkable but still holds complexity compared to a singleton  given to me by a friend as a birthday gift planned to keep as a tot a day bottle but finished it within a few hours with some friends love the smoothness have been a cardhu fan since  2 bottles of this tasted like different whiskeys bottle 1 was delicious bottle 2 was ok very pleased extremely smooth sweet its a bit like caramelised pears but cooked on an open fire as there is a touch of smoke really quite tasty 128077  i discovered cardhu 20 years ago and have been a fan ever since i 39 ve tried dozens of different labels and ages over the years but compared to them cardhu has such an amazing balance from nose to tail without any harshness or overkill like some of the others being a chef my palate is highly refined for subtle flavors and nuances of aroma cardhu continues to be my 1 single malt scotch after 5 years i thought i 39 d never get to drink this amazing malt liquor again thank you jw for bringing it back to market after the original family passed  wow it 39 s so smooth  absolutely lovely some say it 39 s too sweet but i love that about it i get loads of banana toffee and sherryness feels like a christmassy type of drink to me lovely drop will be buying more  a genuinely well rounded singly although smoother a day silkier with fruit and honey layered after taste  my favorite single malt period  bought this mistakenly for sherry pricewise it was comparable to the glenlivet 12 but has a more herbal taste in my opinion i kept smelling star anise for some reason will be going through this bottle slowly as a sipper  it is a very commercial easy drinking scotch bought it on sale for 59 99 cad so no complain peach honey heather peanuts wood oak sherry weak finishing no smoke no peat if i were a newbie i would give this a 5 star and it still deserve a 4 star from a veteran after some years in scotch i would say this doesn 39 t do it for me anymore just like the highland park 12 yr there are better value options e g jw black label 1 75l always on sale before christmas or more exciting prospects balvenie caribbean cask 14 yr auchentoshan valinch nikka from the barrel etc to me i felt like drinking another scotch from the old man 39 s cabinet which the taste we are all too familiar  quite nice but a bit too sweet for my taste very dominant honey and malt not very complex  this was recommended by an old friend who was responsible for my taste for scotch i like gentle single malts just a whisp of smoke or peat over the years i have tried a load of brands ages distillery locations etc i find that aging price brand distillery locations don 39 t matter its whats in my glass and mouth i have enjoyed glenlivet and glenfiddick especially their reserves and 15 year olds i do have to say that my daily goto is islay mist very inexpensive and surprisingly pleasant especially for an 8 year but when i have the extra cardhu will be getting it  very smooth for a single malt wonderful drink with nice after taste i feel it is the best single malt i have ever tasted  even after receiving a pretty extensive education in scotch i never found one i felt like having more than a single shot of they were nice and i appreciated them very much but none of them ever struck me as something i wanted to drink over the course of an entire evening the first time i sat with my scotch educator and a bottle of cardhu it was gone in a few hours hitting it straight up after every sip my mouth just seems to want to have another as a result it 39 s really hard for me to keep a bottle of this around  i like the nose smooth floral and fresh the taste is totally different almost not the same whisky very aggressive and acid i do not like it at all the tasting notes are right on i tried it once in a restaurant and absolutely love it i went to buy a bottle right after good smoky notes and the after taste is superb very gentle i wonder how the 15yo tastes like look forward to try that one  wasn 39 t to impressed with the nose but it has a pleasant honey toffee taste i 39 m not a fan of peaty malts but the slight hint in this one didn 39 t put me off not great but not bad either  i like the nose smooth floreal and fresh the taste is totally different almost not the same whisky very aggressive and acid i do not like it at all purchased on a whim this became the quot go to quot celebration single malt clean damn near refreshing and subtly sweet this is special occasion stuff  most spectacular smooth as silk a winner  just took my first sip amp it is shockingly good not overpowering or intimidating but subtle sweet amp soft but with a lovely long lasting smokey finish this single malt surpass the crown royal by miles guy b alberta canada  what the hell i can 39 t find any wods for this whiskey just finshied half a bottle never use to do that on any whisky i 39 ve tasted  let me preface this by stating my sense of smell i get sweet smoke and smooth  there is a peat and smoke flavor smooth to the palate and a lasting peat and smoke flavor after swallowing one of the smoothest scotches one of my favorites with the balvenie  just the best i ever had just amazing scotch got as a gift not bad at all very well rounded not too complex but some nice honey toffee notes followed by a gentle smoke for the price very good indeed i am wondering if i got a bad batch as i was looking forward to trying this but ended up thinking the 39 card 39 in 39 cardhu 39 is short for 39 cardboard 39 unfortunately it just did not seem to have any personality or distinguishing features i am a peat lover but that 39 s not it i tried glenmorangie quinta rubin the same night and loved it i guess it all comes down to opinion shocker  fantastic scotch it 39 s my favorite whisky i 39 m a big speyside fan though i like my bourbons and can appreciate my laphroaig on a raw winter 39 s night as well got the wife to buy a bot of cardhu and one of strathisla from the duty free on the way back form a business trip opened the cardhu after dinner yesterday first up the bottle design itself is worth buying for the design reminds me of opulent cellars and big vaulted dining halls with a roaring fire and suckling pig on the table grand the nose is pure honey with just a wee hint of fruits and flowers the palate is distinguished opulently rich gorgeously smooth and thick no afterburn just honey apples a whiff of toffee and maple syrup brilliantly rich but stops just short of overdoing it refined with a capital r its like the lady of the mansions that belongs to a distinguished old moneyed family effortlessly opulent without being a gauche show off the finish is wonderful long but not too long just a trace of oak and spices balancing out the sweetness i can understand why many will question quot character quot it doesn 39 t have the big notes you 39 ll get in an islay or it doesn 39 t burst with fruits like a glenmorangie but if you appreciate balance sophistication and refinement this malt is second to none it 39 s designer all right think dior meets elizabeth arden top top single malt and i can 39 t see it lasting long in my cabinet  we have been drinking malts over the last couple of years this is one of the best i 39 ve had comparable to any glen and better than most the 12 yr is not heavy on my wallet as well overall a great drink to catch up with friends  para mi uno de los 2 mejores del mundo si no es el mejor great experiance smooth and no hangover  excellent my first impression and that will not change rich smooth and a soft finish  this is strange there is no arrival to speak of but the finish is superb  this is the absolute best scotch malt there is at this dollar point i love the aroma that i inhale as i take a sip it is like liquid gold in my mouth amazing flavor with no strong after taste and a pleasant burn as it goes down i prefer to sip one or two fingers undiluted by ice or water in my favorite chair i have tried many other malts out there some at higher price point and some lower but i always come back to cardhu thank you  first time i have tried this malt would recommend to all malt drinkers a true classic single malt does everything really well sweetness with an earthy quality hints of fruit sherry notes and smoke well balanced and slips down beautifully easily and smoothly also widely available in spain where i am spending more and more time  liked it better than johnny walker blue i prefer the lighter finishes i can drink more and i don t get the hangover this is my very favorite of them all compares a little to glenmorrangi it won t take you off your feet neat or with a couple cubes i love it  love it goes down a treat and no hangover x ok my next dog will be named cardhu just saying  are u kidding 45 is all i paid for this i bought this upon former said reviews and wow what a serious find soooo smooth huge flavor love it this is crushing my 65 100 bottles of everything and i have a lot of bottles i am going to order the samples from the rest of this fine house truly unreal for the tis a problem this fine liquid i cannot put the glass down  i just picked this up for 45 usd at a local store i really like this one very good quality for the price i highly recommend adding this to your collection makes me want to try the 15 amp 18 the finish is so smooth i do not think one could find anything better at 45 dollars  this is the first single malt we ever tried we were in london at the time we have continued to purchase it whenwe could find it it disappeared for a time a humorous note we have an elderly australian named after this lovelywhisky  it has to be three years since i sipped it and was looking on google to see if i can find some my liquor store no longer stocks it it has been a while but i can still taste it and as far as what poor in comparison said put a dress on me i ll drink it smoothest whisky i ever tasted bar none  lovely nose and as sophisticated as you ll find unfortunately you could drink this all night if you get a chance of this at a knockdown pricethen grab it you wont be disappointed i have been drinking scotch single malts only for over 20 years i have tried many anywhere from nas to 35 year old from all regions of scotland i just bought a bottle of cardhu 12 yr i find it to be quite unremarkable this scotch offers an extremely light nose a very demure palate and an acidic finish with very little smoke or peateness i have no doubt new to scotch drinkers will enjoy this tipple as it is easy to drink but very uncomplicated  not a bad whisky but to me a bit bland and boring very light body and finish the nose is pleasant but taste wise it doesn t deliver probably a good entry level whisky for single malt starters or occasional spirits drinkers  i am a patriotic scot but live overseas and am actually fairly new to whisky i ve started running whisky tasting sessions here where we try lots of different whiskies and judge them on what we personally think of them rather than what anyone else here on mom may have said this opinion is based on the fact that we a multinational group of about 10 12 of us were drinking this alongside some others on that basis my honest assessment ours in fact was that this was pretty tame more than one of my members commented simultaneously that it was for women so sorry if you re a cardhu fan but this was definitely a well below average whisky by the way one of our regular favourites is the glenfarclas 105  this was on sale at my local liquor store so i bought a bottle although i never liked scotch to my surprise i loved sipping this its great sorry i missed it all there years говорят его создавала женская рука возможно это так нежный ароматный в аромате как и во вкусе чувствуются сухофрукты и духи очень элегантный и приятный солод дыма там нет и торфа тоже а вот бочка иногда угадывается рекомендую translation using google translate they say it created a woman s hand perhaps this is so delicate fragrant flavor and taste like dried fruit and felt perfume very elegant and pleasant malt there is no smoke and peat too but the barrel is sometimes guessed i recommend  man this is one of the best i have tested in this category till date i am single malt fan and this re established my faith in the same i had this bottle for a while but once i opened this my wish was that why didn t i did so sooner amazing taste and no hangover i will rate it 9 as i have more to taste  hi if you d like to drop an email to purchasing masterofmalt com they will be more than willing to help you out the chaps at master of malt limited edition bottled 1070 i unopened in original box with booklet how do i know what this is worth and how to sell it this tasted better than the stuff the dukes made in their illegal whiskey barn  viva o cardhu  just been to edinburgh for a weekend and bought this on a whim as a personal gift i like my whiskeys but a lot tend to have a very strong finish to them i was pleasently surprised to find this sweet balanced single malt after a taster in the whiskey experience a dram of this is perfect after a long day working  this is a delicious speyside very balanced with a rich honey sweetness with flavors of apples and pears and some peppery spiciness just a hint of peat that comes through on the nice medium long finish great everyday dram  one of the most scrumptious my palate has had the pleasure   were in scotland a month ago visited different speyside glenfarclas the glenlivet the macallan highlands oban talisker flatland glenkirchie distilleries tasted also some whiskies from islay lagavulin laphroaig ardbeg orkney and springbank from campbeltown i like them all but cardhu is after 10y my one and only single malt love  two things i used to do for my father every year one was to ring him from wherever i was in the world on st patricks day and the other was to buy a bottle of cardhu for him on my way back from wherever i was in the world he died about 15 years ago so this was a lost habit of mine but someone did me an enormous favour this weekend he who is whisky lover so what better way to thank him as to buy him a bottle of cardhu too i say it s the best way you can thank a friend and fellow whisky lover  we just went to a tasting of speyside 12 year old single malts this was hands down our favorite smooth with a honey finish  nicest malt ive ever tasted decided at 46 2012 was going to be the year i get to know single malts cardhu 12 is a must for anyone so easy to drink and enjoy dollar for dollar the best i have ever tried cardhu and oban definitely top my single malt list of favorites oban being a completely different breed  sorry i forgot to rate it  just recieved a bottle of this beautiful single malt for my 50th thanks niccii and first impressions are that it is a superbly flavoured scotch slightly ahead of jura s superstition which i got for christmas thanks helen  great malt very very pleasant couldn t agree more with the above comments it s the best love it so much i daren t open a new bottle too soon as i know that if i do then it will be gone to quickly oh dear  the best single malt by far take a sip and feel the gentle warm glow beautiful  best malt i have tasted buy a long way the best of the best love it  started drinking cardhu in eighties best malt by a long way bottle is well styled to squeeze out last drop  dont know so much about noses and under overtones the bottom line is i am fond of a drop of malt tried to many to think about and without doubt this is the best ive had ok im not lucky enough to blow 5000 on a shot of some prehistoric malt but i doubt it would match this compaired to this your average glenmorangie talasker ect is only fit to get oil off the driveway a superb warm full bodied malt that wont break the bank jim murray says that this malt has the cleanest uncluttered nose that you will ever find and i can t argue with that it d pleasantly balanced with a slight oliness hints of toffee and burnt caramel offset by its sweetness and a slight grassy note the palate is quite full a pleasant uncomplicated marriage of soft butter toffee oak and citrus fruit quite oily with a not unpleasant alcohol nip and a slight peppery finish pleasant if a bit unexciting i imagine that this is the sort of spirit that blenders would die for  a group of 14 males all preferred this whisky to the ardbeg 10 the glengoyne 12 and the glengoyne 10 we also tried a few others but i can t remember what they were these four were the best but the carhu was favourite 
3984.0, in the late 90s macallan 39 s 18 year old was my favourite dram sadly the cost of this sublime drop have rocketed putting it largely out of my league for years i have been looking for a replacement for the old favourite which i remember mostly for its brown sugar and caramel toffee aftertaste well i think i have finally found it in this glendronach 18 sublime smooth with all the toffee caramel i remember a lovely drop  update after two weeks and 30 of the bottle gone i like this the more i drink it the slightly off minor back taste seems to have gone and this is showing tons of deep fruit and malty warmth it 39 s hard to walk past the cabinet no doors without pouring a little one  ohhhh this is a wee ripper sweet scorched caramel brown sugar and fruit cake and a hint of spice dance all around your tongue this absolutely beats the glendronach 21 which seems to not have as much charachter pair with some dark chocolate or a mild cigar just gorgeous  delicious moreish stuff can 39 t say i agree with the berries in the fanciful tasting notes here rich intense with a backbone of something i can 39 t put my finger on want to say 39 malt 39 don 39 t laugh don 39 t regret buying it but not sure i 39 d go for it again there 39 s plenty of rich intensity out there without having to spend 163 98 still tasty rich stuff too harsh tastes more like a lagavulin and the quality gap between this 18 year old and the parliament 21 which is lovely is enormous my personal opinion is it s a disappointment that lets the good glendronach name down just to make sure i compared them both this evening a couple of times before writing my first ever review  this is one gem of a whiskey subtle and classy smooth sherry bomb with definitive highland accents usually i m a fan of glenfarclas and this has surprised me in its quality and resemblance this whisky is superb if you are a fan of glendronach s sherried offerings this is the best of the lot that i have had there is much similarity to the 15yo revival but this just takes it that little step further i drink gd 12yo for every day the 15yo for something a bit more special and this for special occasions i am now trying the gd cask strength batch 7 and it is not what i expect from a gd not even in the same ballpark  it s similar to how cd tracks are ordered your first sip is relief it s worth the money it is complex but it s familiarity keeps you listening to see what s next it doesn t disappoint as you continue to explore the uniqueness that i ve only seen in this dram  its wonderful wonderful wonderful lovely sweet oily goodness to the chap who thinks its too expensive in cape town its r1000 50 quidish than the also very good glengoyne 18 i think the price is very fair sensational a must try if you like thick fruity heavy sherry notes  spent a lot of 2020 trying different whiskies and glendronach allardice is the one i keep coming back to while other whiskies have a time and a place based on day weather locale etc this glendronach 18 y o is one i can sup daily there 39 s an autumnal wintry cosiness to this whisky i have anosmia i can smell a little but not a lot and maybe that certainly affects the smell of whisky and even taste i need rich smell and taste full flavours something that makes my olfactory sense wake up whisky does it and this glendronach is a sweet marzipan sherry dream on the nose and a christmas cake in the mouth and a warming fireside finish sense of place is a major aspect of how i rate whisky full is a good way to describe it fruity and sweet it 39 s an ideal dram for me even at 163 100 i 39 ll buy a new bottle once my current one is done likely very soon  my staff asked my daughter what i would like as a present for retirement she says single malt 16 years or older they got me a bottle of glendronach 18 yr i have been mostly an islay malt partaker for 25 years but my first dram of your 18 yr old wow well done lagavulin 16 move over also love the color  never liked scotch whiskey never understood what other people were tasting it 39 s always been just a burning bitter drink to me luckily a bartender friend of mine convinced me to try this is was free so why not first this is by far more tempered than any other scotch whiskey then i 39 ve ever had oh it still burns don 39 t get me wrong but it mellows very fast second after the initial burn you really can taste all the different things that people usually claim they can taste it was amazing third the price is prohibited here in california s f bay area it 39 s about 170 before taxes if you can find it i realize most people don 39 t have that kind of disposable income for alcohol especially now but if you can afford it get it third it keeps selling out and is not getting restocked i 39 ve been waiting since january to buy a bottle it 39 s now july 22 and i was finally able to find a bottle fourth please try this if you can afford it and are looking for a great scotch whiskey for your home bar made to be savored and sipped it 39 s not for slamming down if you can make a way to afford it this stuff is great  i really love this whisky its a wonderful sherried dram but i have to agree with the previous poster every year the price creeps up about 163 10 only last year i bought the 21 yo parliament for less than this one at its current price its a great whisky but no longer worth the price it is with great regret that i won 39 t be buying another bottle there are other whiskies out there significantly cheaper and almost as good quality  this is one of my top 3 malts but with the unfeasible price rises seemingly every few months i won 39 t be buying any more soon as i dont like to feel im being ripped off the day is coming when the malt whisky price hike bubble bursts and post covid it may be here sooner than you think so yes this is a superb dram but for the price they are asking i can get 2 bottles of superb drams for the same money  maybe i don 39 t get the subtly of some of whisky but my god you cannot fail to taste the rum and the sherry in this when trying some samplers i wanted to be wowed many in the box of my own selection were just decent this made me take notice this was the sort of whisky i was hoping to discover in a sampler set beautiful dark colouring oily syrup finish and a decent amount of marzipan raisins sherry and a bit of rum too taste lingers too very enjoyable immediately on my wishlist  i have 3 bottles of the 2017 filling just got the last two a month ago i also bought a bottle of the parliment with the first order and found out quickly that i much prefer the allardice to it on the palate is orange honey walnuts dark chocolate dark berries and for me lots of maple syrup at the end unmistakable it had a great slightly oily finish some of those dark berries again orange chocolate and as the review said pancakes with gone of maple syrup every time i sit and dip it something new trades my senses but these notes are there every time i truly enjoy this one  wow this stuff is so good brilliant and and well finished dram heavy sherry brown sugar and blackcurrants i 39 m getting defo buying a bottle next a phenomenal whisky and for me one of the best i have ever had even eclipsing the parliament which is wonderful in its own right the nose is rich and complex and you know from that first waft that you 39 re going to be drinking something wonderful the palate is exceptional a true sherry bomb with all sorts of fruity sherry influences as well as a few other subtle surprises the finish the finish is sublime it 39 s goes on and on and on mouth feel is oily rich and luxurious in my opinion a faultless whisky that will please anyone who enjoys a whisky with any sort of sherry influence you should try it at least once if you can  it s back again but at a new higher price  is this juice discontinued from being released on the market or will it be back soon  from the bottle rum raisin aroma nose rum slight grassy notes flavors explode on the palate raisin sherry cask a velvety mouthfeel much oiliness really well balanced flavors a long malty plummy sherry cask finish after a few drops of water cereal amp sherry on nose heavy sherry on palate sweetens up with the water  hello there thank you for your inquiry unfortunately none of our suppliers for glendronach have this product in stock so it doesn 39 t look like it will come back please let me know if there 39 s anything else i can do for you hello masterofmalt comkind regards lucymaster of malt customer service i see sold out will mom get it back in stock  reading all the positive reviews i had very high expectation on this whisky and i am not desappointed the best unpeated whisky i ever had very sweet oily fruitiness long finish warm so drinkable an endless pleasure  i opened this bottle and thought it 39 s not all that but came back to it a few days later and it has improved a lot since opening i love it  the best one i ever had i have a batch of january 2018 bottle opened for about a month comeback to it just yesterday i was absolutely satisfied almost overwhelmed by it its a masterful dram i think if you are a sherry head this simply might be it for the price anyway i also had the yamazaki 18 couple of years ago and i must say yesterday it really reminded me of it a lot the richness and depth without any burn at 46 abv is hard to beat but i think this is actually better than yamazaki 18 or at least the same you will know you drinking something special when you drink it and that 39 s it my all time favorite well first of all i don 39 t know who is selling this for less than 170 because the distributor to retailer price is about 153 usually anything over 90 retail is above my pay grade but i splurged due to the reviews and i can say this is certainly worth it the color is darker than any other whisky i can remember seeing the finish is long and smooth the sherry notes are balances and not overwhelming like macallan 12 this is what i imagine heads of state and royal families would drink complex bouquet of flavors as other reviews mentioned if you 39 re looking to drop 200 or so on a whisky this should be at the top of your list 5 stars it 39 s amazeballs served with awesomesauce is this the botteling of 2017 anyone know anything like this price wise also  rich excellently aged rounded character thick sherry aroma carries through well onto the tongue finish is extremely smooth subsiding possibly too soon  this is a truly wonderful sherry whisky with notes of cinnamon nutmeg icing sugar pecans and a hint of lemon on the nose and a huge oily mouthfeel with orange zest dark chocolate red wine and i have to agree with the thick blueberry note from mom a rather fantastic whisky especially considering how much you would have to pay for macallans 18 yo this in my opinion is superior  simply stunning i was an instant fan of this one and haven 39 t looked back  really wanted to love this one with the excellent reviews and glowing recommendations however there are a few sub par reviews all suggesting sickly sweet cherryness i feel i have ended up with either a poor batch or bad bottling was expecting heavily sherried notes and massive complexity but only managed incredible sweetness and an abrupt sour spice with next to no finish also quickly anestesised the toungue tried opening it out with a few drops slight improvement at this price point i won t something to blow me away this sadly didn t enjoyable on a may aswell basis but found earlier aberlour abunadh batches to be more complex and morish honestly hope i had a poor batch but for this price will i come back for more  i love it and the 21 yo i think is more better did not really know what i would get this was one of 5 different whiskies i had on my wish list based on lots of reading i was blown away the best way to describe the experience like an old xo cognac rich and tasty perfect for after dinner this is really good stuff evis h  this is one of my favourites yes sherried indeed yes sweet love the spice and the long finish  this whiskey for me just has everything maybe i got lucky with this bottle but will be buying more to check was bought by my son as a xmas present and for me it is exceptional not a fan of the overly smoky whiskies but this just has a perfect balance of depth sweetness and flavour  if someone who 39 s passion usually is something peated from islay wants a decent change this one is absolute nurture a huge bonfire will be replaced to chimney size of a small house hiker boots to slippers and raincoat to housecoat just sit back and relax take your time  fantastic incredible mr massive dissapointment mike w you are maaassively uneducated if you are comparing a peated laphroaig to a sherried scotch and claiming a glenfiddich 15 is better hahaha more for us more educated experienced drinker  absolutely incredible single malt and the color of this whisky is immense for its age  i recently got this in my xmas advent calendar i was very excited to drink it because of the reviews below and how much i enjoyed the laphraiog px cask recently i have to say i was very disappointed yes it could get the similarities to sherry but i dont think it offered much else i tried the px cask straight after and it blew it out of the water for me a bad sample not sure but considering the glendronach 21 was top of my wish list i am now having serious doubts others i have had in the calendar glenfiddich 15yr solera and jura elixir were better for a lower price for me mike w i 39 ve had two bottles both purchased in scotland the first was as described by the 5star ratings as an occasional whiskey drinker the only whiskey i 39 ve tried that is better was a springbank 21 about 20 years ago praise indeed however the second bottle was a huge disappointment it still had the long finish but everything else was wrong just tasted like caramel in spirit so this fits with the sub par comments so maybe a bad batch out there curiously the first shop offered me a taster before choosing still the good news is that if you 39 ve been disappointed there 39 s a good chance the next bottle will impress could be worth a taste first  excellent i was introduced to the 15 in edinburgh and was very disappointed to be informed it was no longer to be offered then by chance i came across this in my searching a superior whisky and a must have to my bar bar  absolutely stunning dark fruits and an explosion of sherry and chocolate what a master piece what a surprise this replaces yamazaki 18 with nothing lost on quality and less then half the price please don 39 t buy this  lovely smooth toffee tasting whisky but with some subtle complexity it takes some time to open up once you let it sit for 20 minutes or so it is the best sherry bomb i have had i have the 21 but have not opened it yet  not really for me  an affordable 18 year old that holds its own against any i have ever tried  sherry tripping whisky wow what a great drop i love sherry whiskies this one is a must have for like minded dramlovers not filtered to death and at 46 an honest whisky with a lovely looooong finish  great sherried scotch  awesome dram beautiful juicy sherry bomb better than aberlour a 39 bunadah benriach 17 sherry and glenfarclas 15  i 39 m still quot new quot to whisky but after tasting the 16 year old platinum at a friends place i could not help but want to explore glendronach the 18 year old is really a lovely smooth whisky and reminds me of licorice and raisins very smooth with a long finish that lingers in your mouth  i love three brands in whisky macallan glenfarclas amp glenfarclas glendronach is the unsung hero of sherry cask whiskies their 1995 px 20 years single cask is one of the best whiskies i have tasted in my entire life amazing whisky  the 15yo revival has been my favourite scotch for some time and how disappointed i am that sourcing a bottle now if you can find one costs a min of 163 90 with some people advertising at 163 150 i wont pay these ripoff merchants even when they try play the old 39 supply and demand 39 trick however i recently bought a bottle of allardice and have to say its pretty close there s all the tastes in there of the 15 so at least i can now while away the hours nosing christmas all year round i just hope glendronach don t run out of this too and expect us to wait a few years till they make some more lol  heard about this whisky got two bottles and what a lovely whisky simply awesome 5  this is one of my favorites i just tasted this back to back with the revival 15 and i can 39 t decide which is better they are both top shelf whiskies the revival is more balanced with a hint of spiciness whereas the allardice 18 overpowers my mouth with intense sweet mature fruit toffee and sherry flavor with a deeper and longer finish i have a 2015 bottling which makes my whisky a 20 year old yummy people complaining that this is too sweet what are you thinking this is a sherry bomb and glendronach and other reviewers have made this clear if you hate sweet whiskies stop buying sherry monsters  nose nice and smoky toffeepalate very rich and smooth a nice smoke but not too much and it doesn 39 t last too long probably the best in my tasting set  im on the last drops on my first bottle and im ordering another one this is an absolutely wonderful whiskey on the sweeter side  full of deep rich deliciousness better than various other much bigger name whiskies out there sublime whisky from a great distillery  you shouldn 39 t drink this really you won 39 t like best if you find some other stuff to drink like a no age statement macallan go on take my advice that way all the allardice in the world will be left over for me to drink i have over 80 whiskies in my quot cabinet quot but lately somehow i never seem to get round to any of the others every time i reach for that sringbank 15 bottle or that 23 years old incmurrin or my old favourite glenlivet n 224 durra triumph something makes my arm swing to the other shelf and before i know it i 39 m smiling as another little sunburst of sherried maltiness sends waves of pleasure washing over my taste buds don 39 t buy really please  very good 15 is good but 18 trumps i like it a very well made sherried whisky with no flaws a smooth texture feel and a full bodied whisky not as complex and therefore not as enjoyable for me as the 15y though i would not say its not worth the money but the next time i have to choose i 39 ll go for the 15y  i find myself agreeing with the earlier sub par reviews too sweet definitely smooth but who cares i rarely wake up with a hangover after decent scotch but with this one i feel disgusting the next day and can 39 t get that fermented mushroom cherry jolly rancher taste out of my mouth i 39 m usually a giver of second chances but this is pricey here in mi so we 39 ll see  this one is nice but i dont think it is as good as the 15 especially with the added cost of the 18 hey chaps a master of malt i bought a bottle of this from you not long ago and have had a few drams my previous bottle was a wonderful whisky however this one is just horrible gone are the notes of fruit and sherry replaced by sickly sweet flavours that just make me feel ill i don 39 t know what 39 s the problem with this bottle but i 39 m not sure i 39 d be buying this one again  this is a stunning whisky i 39 m a great favourite of the 15 year old revival but this gem of a whisky is up there with anything i quot ve ever tasted sublimely smooth with a finish that just goes on and on just brilliant  simply amazing bang for buck ratio totally blew me away from the first sip better experience than highland park 18 for half the price if you are into sherried whiskies this is a must  one of my favorite single malt scotches if you ve only ever had a whisky quot finished quot in a sherry cask this is a much different experience glendronach 18 year old spends the entire time in sherry casks and the the nose palate and finish are all a great balance of malt and sherry every day is special when you have a dram of g18  this word must be the most over used trite dull and totally uninspiring way of describing a whisky i see it on almost every review x delicate flavours smooth have i said that already an exceptionally fine dram  a wonderful and pleasureable tasting experience recommend this to everyone and this malt is set to become a star a wonderful and pleasureable tasting experience recommend this to everyone and this malt is set to become a star amazing stuff  maybe the weakest malt of the glendronach range very fruity but not much complexity 15 yo revival has a lot more to offer  this glendronach is one of my favorites dram buy it now   after a very enjoyable 15 y o revival but in the present case we have just a solid higland whisky with a distinctive speyside profile no more no less  had bottle of 18yr three years ago and that was pure joy unbelivable but last two bottles one from this shop and another from local shop in huntly are different still nice but not like before go for 21 yr  fruity and spicy and so tasty i would recommend this for any new whisky drinker pure nectar in a glass  am a regulam user of glendronach so nice am from india
2684.0, i 39 ve tested a lot of whisky in my time as i 39 m 69 years old i think its the best i 39 ve tested its a nice taste it goes down well cheers for that thanks smooth and sweet a delightful drop to savour of an evening  this is your everyday sipper whiskey perfect for the table for company low on complexity but a very pleasant taste  i really enjoyed it i found it smooth with some sweetness  very nice i have nearly finished a bottle  it s the elixir of life smooth warming and rewarding very smooth unique honey taste my favorite but i 39 m no expert  it 39 s a great light drop with a splash of fizzy and a cube nothing to nose and chew but a nice drink any day of the week  i thought it was excellent i favoured it over scottish malt and i know nothing  i thought this was pretty average stuff and quite frankly i cannot see what the fuss is aboutit 39 s a little sickly and tastes of hints of caramel and it 39 s slightly smokey and i was quite relieved when the bottle was finishedit reminded me too much of a middle of the road blended scotch not my sort of thing  the heart of irish whiskey is barley and it s barley s marvelous malt character that irish whiskey well made historically showcased competition inspires many experiments in irish whiskey many of them intriguing showcases of whiskey makers skills of aging in various woods but for me the best irish whiskies remain those that brilliantly showcase barley bushmills 10 year old single malt has few equals in that regard knappogue 12 years old matching it in my opinion but none superior to it as one of the crown jewels of classic irish whiskey  what do i think well apart from the local price increase i love it it s smooth tasty and relaxing this is a sipping drink that you can relax and ponder at your own pace in short it s relaxing and mellow at the end of the day pity the bottle is so small  of course taste is subjective and personal but in my humble opinion best value for money ratio feels very smooth easy drinking an excellent everyday sipper  great irish whisky good taste and even better aroma  pretty good ive been drinking alot of single malts and blends even the bush white and black which are also my favorite blends they make the blends with this single malt which pretty much makes it the backbone not bad i agree with bill murray this is a good all around whiskey leave it to the irish potstill i even chose it over the johnny walker green knowing that it is a sure winner  in bushumills 39 whiskey form north ireland i always feel the hint of peat comparing with jameson is it because of my illusional feeling  i 39 ve tried quite few lower priced irish whiskies and loved jameson for a while but this bushmills 10 year old is infinitely better so smooth and tasty  this is a very smooth whiskey perhaps a bit too smooth there is really no depth here but it 39 s perfect for everyday sipping on a sidenote the whiskey taste 100 percent like nectarine bits in yoghurt if you add a few drops of water spot on and also quite tasty  i was 17 when i first tasted it such a rebel and it 39 s been my whiskey of choice ever since it 39 s very smooth and it 39 s the best single malt in its price range in my opinion it might not mean much coming from someone who doesn 39 t drink often but i 39 ve yet to find a better tasting whiskey  very good fruity and smooth nice spicy orange finish i would have prefer it a bit more salty and creamy i think it would have been a killer whisky considering the price range still a very good surprise  belfast nice and smooth kind of plain not really very different from some of the powers releases good pricing though  if i want quot nectarine chunks in low fat yoghurt quot that 39 s exactly what i 39 ll buy sounds like someone has allowed their imagination to run away super smooth fruity on the palate sweetish with a short finish with gentle vanilla and malty woody notes and a hint of salted caramel an excellent whiskey  a beautiful single malt i still have have half a bottle left from my one litre bottle bushmills has always been my favourite single malt let 39 s see bushmills supply one litre bottles  not to be pooh poohed it is a decent 10 yo for the price not outstanding but it delivers as a 10 yo well balance in the flavours department mild sherry and vanilla toffee a bit subdued but easy drinking if you want excitement look elsewhere  1st time to try a irish whiskey impressed very similar to glenmorangie 18 great price very light refined and pleasant with a noticeable finish to me this is the perfect dram to sip throughout an evening without worrying being distracted about its complexity and not so rough that you want to mix it in a drink a solid 4 star 39 er  equally as sweet aromatic and smooth like glenmorangie 10 and balvenie 12 double wood however better palate really interesting taste  i m a great whiskey hobbiest and enjoy trying sharing and talking about whiskey i have had hundreds of types of whiskey this is a very lovely whiskey indeed enough said  the best 10 ever  i heard the extremely likeable feherty loved this single malt very pleasant and affordable single malt gem  i have never been a fan off irish or bourbon whiskey i was therefor taken aback when at a friend 39 s dinner party i was presented with a bushmills malt drinking it out of politeness i was surprised at the wonderful mixture of quite lovely tastes the initial fruiteness left an aftertaste which was quite satisfying the added bonus being the smoothness of the malt i cannot wait to purchase a bottle  this is an absolut ace of a whiskey you can get lost in the nose which is wonderfully complex for hours it 39 s smooth but offers many layers of flavor perfect for sipping on all day long bushmills 10 has opened up the world of irish whiskey to me and i will gladly explore it further tomas definitely got underripe bananas on the nose taste of spicy bread non specific honeyed finish didn 39 t expect to like it but i do 5 star  after sampling most popular irish blends i 39 ve got to say wow this is an entirely different category take note speyside lovers rich spicy and clean totally looking forward to trying pure pot still and single grain irish whiskey highland park can wait  doesn 39 t taste banana skin at all  smooth fruity delicious and not jameson 39 s  i 39 ve only reviewed scotch on here but got a bottle of this for st paddys day and was pleasantly surprised very smooth with that sweet honey caramel flavor i associate with irish whisky i actually really enjoyed this almost as good as middleton i 39 d say and way cheaper the sugarbear a excellent quality great sweet flavor really give you a good time to enjoy your senses 39  sure there are better scotches out there in the 50 plus range but this single malt is a very high quality whisky that 39 s exceptionally smooth and full of perfectly balanced sweet flavor without being too acidic and scotchy  love this single malt hints of honey and chocolate so so smooth so money so choice  first i should say that i love pure simple unpeated malts i even prefer the base 10 year versions because i don 39 t want the extra sherry or oak flavor that comes with further ageing glengoyne 10 is my favorite and glenmorangie 10 is a close second but even i think bushmills 10 is too bland yes it is remarkably smooth it goes down easy because there is so little flavor to get in the way  my 1st introduction to whiskey and it s 5 cheaper here than anywhere else i can find it neat it tastes like eating ripe saint agur with a tawny port in the mouth the after taste has a hint of coffee with a slight oaky dry feel that comes through longer on the rocks this tastes of ripe peaches amp vanilla ice cream drizzled with honey  fruity brown sugar medium legs harsh before adding water very smooth after that pale gold colour not too appealing great companion while writing an article on art and culture  perfectly drinkable but frankly a bit insipid the least interesting of all the bushmills range faint whiff of cocoa nose almost isn 39 t there at all to my mind taste is also quite bland a bit of dried fruit similar to black bush but not as full or well rounded faint custard and a slight heather finish do not under any circumstances add water the flavour just falls away entirely if you want the best of the bushmills single malt character you really need to fork out for something a bit older i 39 ve tried the 16 year old and that seems to be getting there the 21 is a bit steep for me alternatively get a bottle of the black bush the b10 year old is great if you want something very palatable neat it is very smooth and inoffensive perhaps you want something easy to drink to start your whisk e y journey or to give a dram to a friend who 39 s not a regular whisk e y drinker otherwise i 39 d give it a miss  quite a bit of complexity here i find more fruit than what is suggested by the chaps review and even something nearly floral the palate is good fruity but not mind blowing but i find the finish back to that strong mixed fruitiness with hints of flowers love the start and the end and its quite cheap probably my daily dram moving forward  not at all a man with a fine palate but i do catch the hint of vanilla  it 39 s hard to write even a couple of paragraphs describing bushmills because you all know exactly what it is it 39 s smooth and really nice but like say highland park it isn 39 t your favourite whisky but it might be your 2nd 3rd or 4th favourite if someone offered you a case of it you 39 d be quot mmm yes please quot really good quot middle of the road quot whisky that would not scare off newcomers  шикарний ірландський сінглмальт легкий приємний квітковий аромат запах бананів не відчув але ноти ванілі та яблук проскакують  what a surprise this is a great whiskey lots of fruit and flowers great dram for warmer climates great price too  bushmills 10 is a big step up from the very bland bushmills original blend but not more than i would expect from the premium version while quite pleasant the 10 year old falls way short of the port finished 16 year old  great whiskey very fruity this was my first irish whiskey  unpretentious smooth and palatable drink neat and slow to enjoy the subtlety of this excellent whiskey  not much to say about it noting stands out bland to be better off with the standard bottle or the new honey batch it is a pleasant whiskey to sit and drink but not complex or even particularly expressive of the bushmills character the sherry outweighs any oak it s not bad but i would stick to black bush or even the original fair point on the banana nose though  it had been nearly 25 years since i had had any whiskey when i found myself in ireland for st patrick s day sometime after dinner the guys in my cousins bagpipe band decided to get this american acquainted with good irish whiskey what a treat i was surprised at how smoothly it went down so many times and as been said leaving me with no headache aim sipping some as i write this nice  a very good nose and a delivery but the late palate and the finish have little to offer the triple distilled irish whiskeys have rarely a real complexity nevertheless a good value for money  i didn t find anything objectionable with this whiskey other than a bit more heat than i like on the other hand i didn t find anything exciting in it either the aroma and flavor are both fairly bland karl as far as bushmills goes this for me is the best a very comfortable flavour and i agree with the banana skin nose a very easy drink with some great flavours and after notes  had my first bottle a year ago i must agree bout the banana skin nose very inviting indeed from then on it goes down medium bodied and a little bit more burny in the finnish than i would like to if you look for something to drink it neat better try blackbush this one loves a drop of water more sophisticated than your regular whiskies still reasonably priced to call it occasionally  bought a 1l bottle in frankfurt airport two years ago still have about half of it nose very smooth and delicate but with a richness behind it vanilla almond and hints of fruit palate medium very rounded vanilla again malt still fruity finish malth and vanilla warming a lovely irish whiskey with a little more punch than your normal bushmill jameson etc you can feel the 10 year maturation but check out the 16 y o bushmills as well  not a bad whisky at all considering that my colleague heiko and i drank a whole bottle he 25 me the rest to celebrate an event going well the next day however neither of us had a headache i m sure that counts for something anyway the sherry this time around makes a much better impression that say two years back quite fruity and full a touch of port in the finish very subtle nose in my opinion very good dram for no offense beginners mark whivie be
2403.0, sweet light smoke as good as all hp but don t know why bottles with 43 abv  costs half as much at our government owned liquor stores here in sweden if any of you visiting check the website of swedens state operates liquor stores systembolaget as there are plenty of bargains compared to shopping online ex longmorn 16 is 58 163 glenlivet 18 is 58 163 macallan 12 sherry oak is 44 163  quit rounded touch of smoke on the sweetness  the price is still forthcoming  the best allrounder money can get but get an old batch and give it some time in glass  i 39 ve had a bottle of this on the shelf for a while that i brought from mom that i popped the cork on last night this would be my third or forth bottle of hp18 when i first brought it i think it was just over 163 50 a bottle now it 39 s 163 110 a bottle has the whisky improved enough to justify the price ramp in a word 39 no 39 don 39 t get me wrong this is a very good whisky and if money was no object i 39 d always have a bottle of it to hand but it 39 s not the same as it used to be on the nose it 39 s mostly sweet notes barley sugar marzipan baked apples on the palate those are present along with some grassy and herbal notes the flavour profile actually reminded me of a japanese whisky somewhat it still does the sweet to dry thing although less so the finish was shorter than i remember the hint of peat smoke this used to have was almost entirely absent still a very drinkable whisky i won 39 t be buying another bottle anytime soon however highland park are owned by edrington group who also own macallan they 39 re doing a similar thing with hp that they have done with macallan which is a shame releasing lots of nas whiskies charging a premium for their aged whiskies taking a loyal fan base and rinsing every last penny out of them i see that the hp have been re released in horrible bottles with silly names 39 viking pride 39 etc if you look at similar quality whiskies to the hp18 such as lagavulin 16 old pulteney 17 talisker 18 different flavour profiles but similar levels of maturity and complexity in flavour those whiskies are sold at around the 163 50 70 there is nothing about the hp18 that justifies a 163 40 difference in price i 39 ve given this 2 stars because i 39 ve factored in value for money we are all consumers after all so value for money is important if i was rating the whisky alone i 39 d give it 4 stars because it is very good just not quite as good as it used to be  smooth delicate smoky varying smells and palates of caramel toffee cherry  perhaps it was my sample perhaps i unfairly drank it last night against some much bigger more complicated and flavorful drams two different mortlach 25s a fabulous wemyss bunnahabain single cask the diver 39 s scallop and a pulteney 21 i was excited to try this but it simply didn 39 t stand up pleasant but not complex on the mouth i found it floral almost grassy and with a touch of slightly sweetish light peat but there were no depth of flavors nothing that made my mouth water for more not sure i understand the rave reviews of some reviewers since it may have been the circumstances i 39 ll give it 3 5 but that 39 s almost generous in my view  wow really good i tasted this whisky at the whiski bar edinburgh the smoky arrival fruity palate blowing in your mouth and long finish was exquisite at first my girlfriend who sat on a chair just right beside me hated the smell and the taste of the whisky but after a drop of water and fifteen minutes of time when she tried it again she loved it this is a whisky that change the view who hates smoky whisky the most complex whisky 10 18 year old i 39 ve ever tasted along lagavulin 16 i just take a half star off because of its unreasonable price  years ago i got this for my best friend i would never spend that amount of money on myself he said it was the best whiskey he ever had i see a lot of great reviews mixed in with a couple of just horrible reviews it leads me to believe that it is a great whiskey but somewhere down the line they made a batch that was kinda meh and the dislikes got part of that batch  overrated but still pretty good 136 is a lot to pay one bottle only for me  this used to be one of my favorites i while ago i bought a bottle and i was so disappointed when i tasted it highland park isn 39 t what it used to be  the best 18yo whisky ever drank this whilst on orkney exceptional whisky from an exceptional place  it 39 s a little bit to smoky may need to use some ice with this to really enjoy almost tastes like a double black johnnie walker this whisky is quite good if you can get over the price tag this beauty packs a wonderful punch it sits well on the palate and finishes strong it 39 s not sharp but you do detect powerful spice and citrus maybe a touch overpriced but a great single  this is a great scotch fantastic balance much better nose than the 12 i agree with other posters that this is better priced at glenmorangie 18 levels but i don 39 t agree that it impacts the scotch itself this is a wonderful dram  too much vanilla and too much lumber this is not highland park of old many years ago and you paid a price it really had nothing to do with you years of pain followed until you grew up and grew wealthy now you pour an amber liquid into irish crystal and gaze out your window to the crashing glittering ocean you drink to what might have been but really to what is the tide has shifted and you are in now in control of it all  i had a bit of a hard time with this perhaps it suffered by me having high expectations but that isn 39 t helped by the rather hefty price tag the nose is fantastic but i found it to be a bit of a mess on the palette it doesn t develop into a crescendo it s just all of the place and then the finish is dry and uneventful it isn 39 t that far removed from the 12 y o rather than being a juiced up or amplified version it 39 s a softer more rounded version with a touch less peat and no sulphur flaws something which the 12 suffers from quite badly these days so the fact that it s basically a slightly refined version of the 12 is not a really a bad thing but the fact that it costs about four times as much certainly is it is a decent whisky but if it was priced more reasonably more like at around 163 60 it would be fantastic but at anything close to 163 100 just takes the piss and won 39 t get a repeat purchase from me  this whisky is good it 39 s almost great however what it lacks most is that signature highland park finish that i 39 ve come to love so much i missed the initial watering of the mouth followed by the wonderful drying in the finish as well as the smoke and oak all of these things are present in the 12 and the 15 year but disappear in the 18 overall it 39 s a good whisky and i keep a bottle of it handy but i 39 d recommend getting two or three bottles of the 12 yo for the same price it 39 s just an opinion but i like it more  i am not sure what captivated me most perhaps the way it felt in my mouth a delightful feel the subtle notes of citrus with the oh so pleasant creamy honey this is by far my new favorite  can 39 t beat this one but searching is always fun  aaaaa  this is a great dram the basis of compare for any other whiskey at the same age try them dalmore glenfiddich even macallan this is the centre for all to be compared to  forgot to add the stars could do better hp  save your money and buy 2 bottles of benromach 10 with change left over the hp is nice whisky but benromach 10 is better just my opinion hp is positioning itself as a luxury brand and i 39 m sure they do well quality whisky and marketing brands are two different things probably was a great whisky at one time i 39 ve had two bottles of hp 18 in the last year and will never buy it again of course i may well be wrong but there you go  if hp18 was priced the same or 20 more than hp12 i would always have a bottle of hp18 on hand but the fact is the price is prohibitive chill filtered and coloring added in a 120 bottle of whisky that sometimes goes for 150 it 39 s not a bad bottle it 39 s just that there are more exciting options for 120 or less where hp18 really shines is with new whisky drinkers i 39 ve given 4 people a dram all of them with a beginner understanding of whisky and they all loved it some of them saying it 39 s the best they have had or it 39 s allowed them to finally understand the appeal of drinking whisky it has the perfect balance of flavors that don 39 t offend but for whisky adventurers it might come off as a bit boring if you 39 re introducing people to whisky i couldn 39 t recommend a better bottle  i got a bottle of this a couple of years back based on good reviews not on here at first i really didn 39 t get what the fuss was about but the more i go back to it the more i like it a great all rounder if you give it a chance whether it 39 s worth the money is a matter for each individual to decide but i wouldn 39 t say it was overrated  i am a relative newbie to this and made up an advent calendar with what i thought were less peaty choices this is day 2 and there 39 s definite peat here i 39 m reading the notes above i had to look up botrytis it 39 s a mold i 39 m not sure why but nosing this whisky made me want to sneeze and maybe that 39 s why peaty and acrid yes i do taste a little of the fruit conserves as mentioned above sharp edged for this taster complex and might appeal to some for that reason better than my first advent calendar day pick which was dalmore 15 but still not likely to become a favorite too sharp at the finish for this taster  i don 39 t now yet which batch is what i bought hp is one of my favourite distillery its very nice but not so quot wow quot feeling what i expected  at the cost it should have made me happier when i first opened it 6 months ago it did not it actually made me wonder what all the fuss was about it smelled and tasted like a young 3 5 year old that was not ready i cringed as it was supposed to be 18 three months later and the liquid at just under the shoulder i was still left very perplexed at what i had paid for as it sure was not floating my boat in nose or taste now at about 1 2 of the bottle it has finally opened up to a different realm of what it should have been when i opened it 6 months after opening i like a good single malt from the peat to the sweet side of it it just took way to long for this one to progress to where it should have been upon opening at least now a dram will open up as it sits and give me those nice floral notes sweet intoxicating honeys and a creamy caramel the arrival is still nothing to make me want to write home to grandma about and the finish is exceedingly short and a tad hot if i buy this again i hope the batch is better as per ralfy they seem to change a lot from batch to batch that 39 s bad when you cant keep up quality due to a bad master blenders nose 4 5 from me  very very nice dram indeed however paying that price is completely unjustifiable for a scotch that has added coloring and is chill filtered i would of hoped for more bang for my buck i will most likely never purchase another highland park maybe the 12 year old as long as its reasonably priced  i disagree with some of the reviews here this is a very good scotch has a very thick oily finish that is very remarkable i tried this at a local bar and thought it was very good probably not worth the price tag of buying a bottle but i would definitely try it again  hp18 used to be a nice safe go to whisky to recommend to anyone who isn 39 t a big fan of peat but would like to try something smoky with a good body and complex taste but the last bottle i bought in autumn 39 14 and finished some time ago was as unimpressive as the ardbeg special releases of late auriverdes kildalton etc it 39 s still ok and i can 39 t find any flaws in it but neither is there anything that would really make it stand out and at 100 there absolutely should be the whisky industry may have forgotten this in their rush to please clueless millionaires but 100 is quite a lot of money hence this baby is no longer welcome on my shelf as it is  really disappointed wasting money on a over hyped whisky calling this a great whisky is so over blown yes it soft bit of peat and sherry but again lacking any real substance i don t seem to be the only one with this view more than a bad batch  i had great expectations for this whisky after the reviews this bottle has received but found this whisky to be a real disappointment the main issue i have with it is that it just doesn 39 t seem to excel at any point there is nothing distinctive that gives this whisky any hope of gaining any form of character and when you consider the price point of this whisky for me that 39 s pretty poor sure its smooth and relatively easy going but it doesn 39 t offer much more it fails to inspire and the the flavour profile is lacking in short its pretty boring it claims to be sweet like toffee yet has nothing on the maccallan it mentions peat yet cannot hold a torch to the ardbeg or llaphroaig on top of that it says it has a balance of these flavours yet is not as smoky and fruity as the lagavulin for me you can tell a good whisky from the infusion of aromas that linger within your glass that are captured with each sip to the point that when you visit your empty glass the day after you can smell the richness of the dram this has none of that again at this price point i expect so much more will not be purchasing hp again in the foreseeable future and would suggest to those that believe this is a great expression you reach out a little further  bought it without having tasted it beforehand at first i thought i 39 ve gotten a poor batch due to the harshness bitternes that overwhelmed me but after a couple of weeks with regular tastings 4 5 drams total it seemed that the bitternes had been toned down a lot and it became sweeter and more complex i reckon this is due to the oxidation occuring in the bottle over time not worth the price though in my opinion  a few years ago not long after it was winning all the awards i tried this and was astonished at how good it was recently added a sample to my usual order and was equally astonished at how bad it has become the smoke was there but with no sweetness or body it tasted thin and watery and had no finish disapointing and at twice the price a rip off this 18 yr is priced way too high not as complex as glengoyne 15yr or yamazaki 12yr for that matter the body is dull and boring for the price loved it from the first drink has just about everything including extreme drinkability  called the best all around whisky there is and that is absolutely true not exactly my best cup of tea since my taste is more towards islay but i can still dream about hp 18  had a bitter taste not wht i expected i like the 12 way better maybe bad batch very upset for the price from a neat pour this dram lends a nose of oak caramel flan and a whiff of gorgeous peat the honeyed palate is full and velvety with a touch of saltiness and flows into a delicate long oaky and lightly smoked finish simply sublime not overly complex but this one doesn 39 t need it a lot of reviews have commented that it 39 s overpriced personally i wish whisky was free maybe whiskysanta will see this unfortunately despite what the distilleries are or aren 39 t doing in or against our favor if the demand is there the price goes up i 39 m not going to recommend we stop drinking this stuff but if we did would it be cheaper probably not save those pennies  tasty but to expensive and the batch differencesin the past don t thrill me hate all the nas stuff they put out now days macallan highland park ardbeg s strategy will fail belive me  it is quite good if you add up the complexity from the nose to the finish at every sip you get a lot for you money insane complexity and one of the longest finishes i 39 ve experienced in a whiskey it really takes you through a journey from nose to finish great experience  went to a tasting that included both the 18 yo and the dark origins along with the common 12 yo my usual scotch was disappointed in the 18 no real added complexity to my palate relative to the 12 and much less flavorful than the dark origins will not be adding it to my bar  very tasty sweet stuff indeed round full palate with fruit slight salt and a little smoke reminded me very much of jw black maybe a younger highland park features in that blend does seem a little over priced though  let me tell you i just paid 130 for a bottle of this stuff in miami fl when i first discovered it it was 109 so i understand why people are upset that the price has been inflating quickly however a good bottle of this stuff is truly one of the great scotch whiskeys you are going to experience it 39 s just absolutely marvelous and if you don 39 t believe me go buy a bottle and you 39 ll see what i mean smelling it as it calms down in your glass after pouring it is the absolute best then the signature highland park sweet turns dry effect on the palate couldn 39 t possibly be captured better than it is here the finish is great as well the reality is that this whisky is still a good value at 130 a bottle as for the batch quality issues i 39 ve had 4 bottles of this in the past year and all of them were excellent batches except one which had a slightly less quality finish however even that bottle was 90 100 stuff this won best whisky in the world for a reason it 39 s one of the absolute best  this was offered to me as a gift and what a surprise it was indeed deliciously smooth well balanced malt surely one of the best ive had thus far would defenitely like to purchase another one but quite frankly i cant really justify spending 180 canadian when there are more reasonably priced bottles in the same age statement for example a glenfarclas 25 too much hype snobbery and marketing gimmick doesnt justify the price at all perhaps if it were more natural cough cough un chillfiltered and natural contcolor and a higher alcohol then you might have something worthy of raising the price  i bought a couple of years ago for 55 pounds btl now it costs me around 100 pounds or maybe more highland park is trying to build its reputation as a luxury brand just like the macallan or glenmorangie if the price keep going up i will pass and focus on lesser known brand that still retain its good quality like aberfeldy old pulteney my all time favorite whisky a mild salty smokey honeybutter experience magnificently balanced used to cost 70 eur about a year ago now nearing a 100 eur belgium still worth trying if you never have but personally i 39 m passing for any more bottles at this price point  i enjoyed my bottle of hp 18 received as a present but why is it nearly three times the price of the 12 year old i certainly won t be buying anything from hp until they come totheir senses and reaslise that they must provide good value as well as a good product  great whisky indeed and worthy of the praise it receives but as it s gone up by near 163 20 in the last two years you can forget it from me shame the whisky industry is run by greedy suits ever wanting more so as the consumer i ll move into another quality dram a reasonable price always about money and how much more they can squeeze out while the quality diminishes and yet the masses keep paying it shameful x excellent whisky but the previous price point was good the new one around 100 or more is just bonkers hp learn to rein in the greed or lose a customer for good  even at 43 although the price has almost doubled in months not much to add to the title nose is awesome so many flavors if i were to drown in a whisky this might be the one i d pick palate is reasonable somewhat similar to the nose fruity but light in umami finish is almost non existent compares well to green spot but a little more maltier  this is the stuff you wanna get into malts start at the top u won t regret i m norwegian we got loads a money from the black gold nows time to invest in malty gold so get down to her lokal grog shop and ask the assistant i wanna highland park 18 and sit at home and drink this stuff and say this is the loyfe this is moy dream fulfilled its full of smoofnis and creemy like a girls legs if u aint ad much luck in bed this is a gud alternator bye malty mates oym off to git some  very balanced flavor with a light taste of smoke at the finish the smoothest whisky i ve ever tasted  beautiful single malt from kirkwall i can understand people s frustration with getting a bad batch fear not highland park has made sure this whisky is better than ever this is really more or less highland park 19 as i understand it with older stocks now being used not the whisky it was and so damned expensive now if you re looking for great highland parks then g amp m are the place to go  rich and tasty one of the best single malts out there  rating within class and price range exceptional value pushes it from a 9ish to 10 this is 43 usa bottling  batch lg276r l310 070 least that s what it appears to be a trial size accompanying the 12 year package a nice all rounder building upon the whisky of all regions character of the 12 by maturing downward a bit the alchohol fire wood and smoke flush invoking a sense of well being and comfort like your favorite dungarees sweater and loafers for my tastes the most immediately enjoyable pour i ve had including the very good glendronach revival 15 and balvenie 15 sb  reminds me of sitting in a small village pub in winter fire blazing sipping on honey warmth i m am not a huge scotch drinker but this one this one could potentialy change me forever  my boss gave it as a gift special the balance and texture is exquisite the smokiness is refreshingly appropriate for a the smooth nature across the pallet treat yourself to the pleasure you wont be disappointed i loved it and have purchased another bottle for holiday guests thanks to my boss for the great taste  this is a challenging smsw today you love it yet tomorrow you might hate it but you still want it it does not just give you what you want when you want it you need to search for it and you need to earn it the above statement reflects my actual feeling when i was frequently sipping it day in day out such boldness and complexity everything available in one beautiful package  raise the abv up to 46 or 48 and i wonder what would happen here would be very interesting and it could be outstanding  i can only give this whiskey a few words they are the tears of a god  this is simply one of the best whiskeys out there i put it slightly below the macallan 18 and in terms of value it s at the top everyone talks about the balance and i have to agree i have tried the highland 25 and the highland 18 is much better head to head in addition to costing 1 2 the price it s smooth balanced full of flavor and doesn t have the harshness of the 12 year in my opinion 18 years is the optimal aging for whiskey  it if great whiskey and personally i put it among top 10 scotch whiskeys i tried so far 120 were sampled we had four bottles of hp 18yo between my whiskey buddy and me but recently got another bottle which really different it has really bad and bitter alcoholic taste with some hp character on background i contacted hp distillery and got no response but it seems from the internet reviews that several recent batches of hp 18 yo are indeed looks like mine bottom line out of five bottle of hp 18 yo four were great and one not good  love it as to the batch issue my faith is renewed i am once again a disciple of highland park 18 still waters run deep  keep your eyes peeled for loki too available very soon but watch out he s a mischievous so and so the chaps at master of malt i am a huge fan of highland park and single malts as well as bourbons in general i d have to say whisk e y only comes a few times a week for me as my main focus is craft beer but i m telling you highland park anything is hard to beat i always have the 12 15 and 18 at my home bar the 25 comes occasionally but this is in my opinion the best 18 yr old single malt scotch on the planet ive had many good ones but none have done it the way this one does it brilliant liquid here now let s hope i can get my hands on some 16 21 30 40 and maybe some thor lol top shelf when given the choice i always come back to this one by far my all time favourite scotch i own a great collection but this is the one i go to for those special occasions when i close my eyes i feel like i m in a gentleman s club in the 1930 s sitting back in a comfy leather armchair and sipping this slowly while enjoying a good cigar highly recommended  normally i absolutely love this scotch but the last time round i ended up with a dud of a bottle after surfing around online i saw that others are complaining as well my bottle was not a freak of nature or the victim of quot cork rot quot it was just a bad batch so to speak when the 18 year is good it s very good but when it s bad it s dismal beware of recent batches  a superb scotch balanced and absolutely a joy to drink as close to a perfect scotch as you are going to get i immediately went out and bought 2 back up bottles  i m fairly new to single malts but so far this one is the best i m almost done with the first bottle but got 2 back up bottles  the standard hp12 was the very malt to cause me to take whisky seriously three years ago after tasting buying and gaining more whisky than i can really afford since i finally treatd myself to a bottle recently my what a treat i worried that i d put it so high up in my mind prior to tasting that it may fail to impress no chance from the first sniff to finishing my first glass i feel i have found a long term friend presuming they maintain quality i will certainly be buying another bottle in the future if i had to pick a small fault it would be better bottled at 46 but this is an excellent dram to be savoured keep it consistent hp  lovely perfectly balanced whisky although on occasion i do get more out of the 1998 travel 12 year old overpriced here in australia 160 00 i just also got the overpriced leif eriksson travel edition overpriced but lovely stuff there is a lot of hate out there for the eriksson hp but let it breath for at least half an hour with a lid it really opens up  after lafroaig and lagavulin this one does not impress much though it has some unusual peaty traits  decadent whiskey this is perfect for every mood and if i was a high roller i would sip this until the cows came home i wanna bathe in this wonderful creation  this one is quite possibly the best balanced whisky i ve ever tried it s got a bit of everything smoke but not overpowering a touch of honey sweetness a delicious salty tang and a mouthwatering finish one of my 4 5 favourite whiskies  icon  an exeptional whisky i have a collection of around 50 single malts and i have to say this beats them all superbly balanced and smooth a night in front of an open fire is made for this offering from orkney well done hp well done indeed i have to say i agree with pretty much all the positive and critical reviews here firstly it is exceptionally well balanced and a fine whisky but i also have to agree with one of the more critical reviewers i also fail to really get excited by it perhaps because it is too balanced maybe it doesn t excel in any one area but hits so many notes well still i have to recommend it its a mighty fine malt  b ger me this is good isn t it  i just can t get excited about this whisky i ve quickly built up a collection of different single malts over the last couple of years and regularly buy samples too but this one doesn t give me much to shout about don t get me wrong it s a fine whisky but after 5 or 6 glasses over the course of time not one night it still fails to inspire me as many other whiskies have i think at some point it was voted the best single malt in the world so i m clearly in the minority but hey it s all down to taste  perfect balance in sweetness and smokiness i agree with the word is balance post you can almost find a bit of everything in this whisky all in perfect balance with every other flavor buy it drink it and enjoy this whisky is a special one  i love all types of whisky sherried smoky peaty briney floral honeyed spicy you name it if it is a good version of its genre i will happily drink it this one has all these things in balance none dominate all blend together i have to say that in my view this is way way better than the 12 year and it is one of the best i have drunk if i said it was also a bit like some of the better japanese whiskies but seemed just a tad more authentic how would you take that i hope like a shot cos authenticity comes cheaper in this case 50 well spent  if you think the 25 and 30 is good try this it s better oh yes believe you me this is one of the best bottlings to come out of scotland  this one must be in every whiskylovers collection etc drink it enjoy  by far the best hp in the standard bottlings perfectly balanced 
2020.0, i bought a bottle for christmas at a reasonable price of 163 99 great value for a 25year old malt and although i enjoyed it very much maybe expected a little more from it than i got maybe a few more abv maybe a little more 39 sherriness 39 maybe a little more of the fruit tastes associated with some sherried drams would have made a difference i 39 m not sure but i 39 ll re visit it again at some time just not now  an extraordinarily balanced and wonderfully complex sherried speyside you can fall asleep in the nose alone breathtaking cream sherry and honey without a trace of sharpness balance balance balance so smooth it can be imbibed without a drop of water but a drop or two serves to lengthen one of the outstandingly gorgeous finishes you ll ever taste incomparable a work of genius  very tasty it s complex you ll need to spend some time with it there s a lot going on and it leaves you pleasantly confused by what s going on in your mouth generally though lovely aromas very smooth finish lasts forever  fantastic excellent very valued for money very smooth highly recommended  not going to lie my wife brought me a bottle for xmas i was very exited to try it quite disappointed with the initial taste very sharp and not as smooth as i was expecting won 39 t be buying another bottle  glenfarclas 25 on the nose sherry grape fruity oak vanilla sweetness fruity cereal note malty honey mild spiciness maybe a hint of nutmeg hint of apple orange zest maybe a very little hint of aniseed nuts cinnamon fresh note soft complex bread chocolate palate zesty fresh notes creamy note light spicy note oak little bitterness slight drier mouthfeel slight dark chocolate a hint of pepper with a little heat has a bit of a bite slightly intense  working my way down i like it this 25but prefer the 21 gonna try the 18 next i don 39 t claim to know much about whisky but i know what i like and what i don 39 t like and this stuff is lovely smooth as silk and the more you have the more you enjoy it seems good value to me too for a 25 year old one  the best i have had to date the finish is ever lasting make sure you taste it like a good wine smell it before you let it breathe then after wow quality 100  gorgeous 100  smooth sweet complex and simply delicious i had high expectations and this lived up to them highly recommend  very good stuff not extraordinary to begin with if i 39 m honest but by the time i got to the bottom of the bottle i was simply pining for more oh and very reasonably priced or a 25 years old single malt  the maturity complexity and balance are nothing less than impressive feasable price for a 25 year old single malt splendid quality one to cherish in my cupboard  i 39 ve had glenfarclas 17 21 and 25 and this one is definitely worth the extra 163 incredibly smooth and rich with a satisfyingly long finish liquid gold  a fabulous bargain this 25 yr old sherried malt it improves with air as well quite a bit a few weeks with a few out of bottle will enhance it further not that it is not already good typical glenfarclas profile just smoother and more of everything probably the cheapest 25 yr old as well as one of the best struth my understanding is that it is not 100 oloroso sherry cask matured but combined with the lesser quality fino sherry casks having said that you would need to be a 39 ralfy 39 to know the difference excellent spirit but just a little weak tastes watered down  given to me by my middle son for my 80th birthday could not have wished for anything that would give me more pleasure a genuinely great malt whisky and a right rare treat  outstanding dram very smooth and with a single ice cube 129482 this is definitely one of my favourites  lacks character in my opinion with no smooth transition between nose palate and finish admittedly the taste is good but the nose isn 39 t very inviting and the finish is pretty generic it 39 s not a bad whisky by any means but i expected more given the age  i am very impressed with this dram sweet bouquet very pleasant on the tastebuds and wow what a finish  yeah it s great stuff but i can t help but think it gets to a point of diminishing returns at some stage you know i thought sipping a 25 year old single malt would be like having kylie minogue sit on your face but whilst it was very good i am increasingly convinced that like wine it s just a game of hyperbole and snobbery i m a huge fan of anything by balvenie and while i agree that the 21 year is better than this to be honest if you blind taste tested me i d probably prefer the 14 caribbean cask too and certainly the 17 year as well this is very smooth with nice sherry notes but not enough toffee for me what with my favourite whisky probably being the glenlivet master distillers reserve small batchnow having just made that statement i m working my way currently towards more than 5 large doubles a mix of the glenlivet mentioned above the 18 year glenlivet and the 25 year glenfarclas and the latter is getting increasingly moreish with each imbibement to wit it is smoother than an oiled tit i bought this for 163 100 120 as i thought it was incredible value for a 25 year old whisky but the best value is still probably glenfiddich s 18 year for about 163 66 it is deeply complex has a great bottle can never get on board with macallan the rolls royce of whisky s but anaemic looking pish with a cheap chardonnay bottle urgh and a great deep colour proper magical stuff i d like to see a bunch of people here actually posting comments taste test a bunch of variably priced whisky s blindly i reckon most of them myself included wouldn t immediately know a 12 year old glenlivet from the 52 year old macallan you would have to have a hole in your head to actually drink that 163 79k and people question why i m dubious about untrammelled free markets christ i humbly suggest master of malt offer a testing with a few of us including professional tasters offering a variety of whiskies of varying values and posting it on youtube for posterity and see if any mere mortal can determine the class from the dross i leave it in the very capable hands of the purveyors of this fine website to arrange this i m sure you can confirm my ip address but i m here when you need me winking face emoji  omg absolutely amazing i always thought that 39 old 39 scotches were a waste of money and tried a few that i felt did not warrant the price however after trying this one i was so blown away by the quality nose and flavour that i had to write this just break a wee dram at room temperature with a tiny splash of highland spring water and see if i am wrong what a wonderful scotch worth every penny and i thought the 15 year old glenfarclas single malt was the best i had tasted  some of these reviews are so mixed and i honestly think are based on basic palates this is about as good as it gets unless you are chasing single cask releases above the 400 mark it s 25 years old let it sit and open up use a glencairne glass and realize what you are sipping and if your palate isn t good enough to experience this fully maybe go back to nikka from the barrel and johnnie walker platinum blended trash 4 8 5 nice dram if you let it sit about 15 minutes that s about when it gets good legs on it and rounds out to a smooth experience probably just a tad over priced but i m not complaining improves with good company can t wait to share with my dad during the christmas holiday season  i have given only a few whiskies a perfect 10 10 score on here but this probably deserves an 11 10 this is a very special whisky let it sit for 25 minutes before nosing it so you can really appreciate it so much sherry cinnamon red apples toffee hint of menthol gingerbread cocoa the chaps at mom hit these tasting notes right on the nose truly spectacular with the longest finish i 39 ve ever had in a whisky that just continues to develop new flavors on the palate glenfarclas never ceases to astonish me with how good their product is and for the price you just can 39 t beat em epic dram cheers the sugarbear there s a reviewer further down saying he doesn t like this then comparing it with laphroig saying it s better that s like comparing black and white two different whiskies all together some people should really think before they speak this is an excellent 25 year old and a fraction of the price of many 25 year old malts out there excellent from a great wee family distillery absolutely love the 15 so i wasn 39 t impressed when i first opened the bottle but a few months later and it is phenomenal  never ending finish as the minutes go by the layers of complexity keep on coming it costs the tongue with a wonderful buttery creamy feeling one of my all time favourites  i would recommend it outstanding not as good as before i think 15yo and 21yo is very close still a good whisky though overpriced overrated even at 4 stars this is just simply a poorly made whisky lacking any interesting flavors or depth hot on the tongue harsh on the nose and just less than mediocre on every front tried it neat with a melted ice cube a splash of soft water and with various snack foods nothing could save it as a reference a few of my favorites are laphroaig 10 cask strength hakashu 12 jw platinum 18 nikka straight from the barrel blanton 39 s and four roses single barrel all of these are better for less money in my opinion  a little over priced but with a good nose and tastes of wild burnt flowers so not bad but would be better in another cheaper price range however worth a 5 star very smooth excellent very long finish creamy and smooth  nice flavor but not much different then the 21  first bottle i bought was delicious especially flavours on swallowing oaky coffee etc but next bottle i got 6 weeks later was lighter and just not as delish batches differ maybe but has put me off slightly what was originally my fave dram ever due to inconsistent bottles 128526  wow wonderful nose warm thick amp creamy in the mouth sweetness gives way to a prickly warmth on the end of the tongue this is the first 25 yr old malt that i 39 ve purchased amp i think it 39 s fantastic my other drams this year have been old pulteney 17 amp 21 yr old amp bunnahabhain 18 yr old amp as much as i love these malts glenfarclas 25 yr old just has something more to offer  probably the worlds best whisky pound for pound period it 39 s incredible that this distillery can offer such an barnstorming whisky for a shade over 163 100 in 2017 i was in two minds whether to actually bother writing this review as it 39 s a real secret gem but glenfarclas deserves praise i 39 ve been drinking whisky for a while now and would consider myself fairly experienced certainly experienced enough to know that this whisky needs time lots of it if your naive enough to pop the cork and consume the bottle in a week or so you 39 re not getting the best out of the quarter century malt give it time savour it and boy you will be rewarded i 39 m genuinely concerned that this malt will start to catch up with some of its contemporaries on the price e g 163 250 163 300 i may have to buy a case quick smart to potentially avoid huge disappointment just buy a bottle and enjoy  sweet lingers with honey bouquet yet unexpectedly light on palate with a sherry undertone best to be enjoyed on its own a great price point for a 25 year old dram but the taste feels more like half of the age statement which probably explains the price  i am not a scotch expert i am a normal gentleman that has tried several single malt whiskeys in restaurants and wants to learn more to do that i recently purchased 10 samples at least one was from each region of scotland i had no regard for price the goal was to try some very fine whiskeys i wanted to learn this review is based on that i am giving each sample 5 stars simply because they are all fine whiskeys and my pallet is not refined enough to make a 1 5 judgement this is a great whiskey very smooth with just a hint of sherry taste very smooth very drinkable of all the samples i bought ths was far and away the lowest priced it was also one of the best i 39 ll guarantee that there will be a bottle of this in my cupboard  picked this up for special occasions we will see if that last easily one of the top 3 drams i have ever had  though a little underwhelming for a 25yr character this is a great whisky not too much influence from either the oak or the distillery very good balance without one overpowering the other nose slight menthol sherry amp mild chocolatepalate smooth full body the long maturation is easily enjoyable superb mild spice chocolate amp cinnamon finish long bitter sweetness i have 3 family cask glenfarclas 1986 1988 amp 1991 they are amazing whiskies excellent balance but they are slightly better because of the high abv a few might lack the experience in tasting much aged whiskies amp their reviews probably reflect just the analysis of the intensity of the whisky  i 39 m about 1 4 into my bottle now i find the complexity and thickness of this liquid changes when the dram is poured and left for at least 20mins i keep my whisky in a dark cool cupboard so i think the change to a warmer temperature helps this open up this bottle was supposed to be kept for special occasions but i find drinking this 25 is a special occasion so it 39 s catch 22 this is a cross between a christmas cake and a black forest gateaux with extra cherries you can sip this and chew it splendid stuff beautifully balanced whisky at an excellent price point tried this back to back with the kavalan sherry oak the glenfarcles 25 is just more elegant less in the face with the sherry well worth the price  don 39 t get me wrong this is a really good scotch but for a 25 hell no if you want to be blown away for the same price glengoyne 21 you 39 ll thank me later  enjoying the 25 especially at this price point sugars and spice pop out balanced by earth and drying sherry alcohol is more aggressive on front than to be expected for an old scotch but the finish is long and chewy  for me perfection in a bottle  this is one of the best whiskies i 39 ve had hands down sherry fruit and chocolate for days and for the price are you kidding i picked it up for 139 from a total wine and recently saw it marked down to 119 a 25 year old for under 150 simply unbeatable  you can 39 t go wrong with this one  had a present of a bottle for my 65 th birthday it was only surpassed by the 40 year old i was given on my visit to your distillery on my 60th birthday there are whisky 39 s and there are whisky 39 s but none can compare to glenfarclas had this whisky in a restaurant the description is spot on this will be my 15th whisky most of them fruity and or chocolatey allthough i 39 ve had quite some amazing whiskies this one is easily top 3 it truly caught my attention the moment i sniffed the complex flavours yves from belgium my first quot sherry quot whisky im new to all this was a bottle of glenfarclas 17 i ordered a dram of the 25 and ill be back for a full bottle i 39 m no expert to leave fancy tasting notes but i bloody love this 25 should i expect more with the family casks  fantastic drop with the best finish i have ever tasted anyhow rich full sherry taste all the time with magnificent spiciness and vanilla citrusy flavor bugger the price this whisky is worth every penny you invest in i simply love simply the best  had this in my whisky advent calendar amp thoroughly enjoyed it all others so far have needed a splash of water but this was just like heaven in a glass warm smooth delightful no harshness in taste or smell i savoured every last drop rueing the fact i only had a dream not a bottle quickly disappeared from stock here but i shall be buying it when back in my first glenfarclas but certainly not my last  the nose was sharp alcohol front with a light touch hinting at the possibility of a full body flavored yet underwhelming as it hit my tongue the first moment was the standard fire of alcohol from a bottle 10 years its junior it then slips wetly around the tongue with a touch of sweet fruit but no real body it gives off slight hints of smoke enough that my pregnant wife stated quot oh you 39 re drinking another glass of leather quot but it was literally a hint the aftertaste was mostly of honey alcohol and a fresh palate ready to drink something with more body i would drink it again but i would not pay more than 75 for a bottle final note i am doing the 2015 advent calendar as a result i get one drink at it to decide if i like it enough to buy more sometimes i need to drink something three or four times to make up my mind thus my rating is based on a one time drink experience  some of the previous reviews left me feeling less than excited to taste this drop i 39 m very pleased to announce its a delightful dram reminds me of christmas pud very sweet and very long no nasal burn and no harsh alcohol taste not normally my thing but if you got the dosh then have a taste  oranges cloves mint then chocolate leather and oak a complex whisky i very slightly prefer the 15 though which is exceptional value for money  having gotton use to the family cast i find this one lacking i would prefer more complexity however it is a good glenfarcus and it is a wonderful drink given that it cost less than a comparable family cast i would say this is a good value i gave 3 189 stars because for the money it 39 s a great buy and wonderful to drink i 39 m just spoiled by the a family cast  this is one of my favorites smooth and has a nice balance of dried fruit bittersweet chocolate and oakieness with a hint of cinnamon the light spiciness and sherry hints make this a really nice dram of whisky  a great whisky at a great price i take issue with the reviews below stating this is not up to standard it 39 s simply not the case and clearly don 39 t know what there talking about referencing a 163 235 bottle as a better alternative as with macallan and glengoyne this has also spent its full maturation in sherry casks the higher the age the longer the flavours are absorbed into the spirit giving a deep full bodied taste full of dried fruit this bottle easily matches the glengoyne 21 i 39 m not saying its better but you can search reviews online to see how highly regarded this dram is and at this price you will struggle to find better macallan 25 is 163 695 to put it in perspective and the dalmore 25 is 163 625 to name just a few  we feel for our taste buds that this is parallel to the macallen 18 in all aspects from flavors to smells to smoothnesswould most certainly buy this and give as a gift i bought the 25 y o glenfarclas for the outcome of tax season good season cheers bad season get drunk it turned out to be a good tax year and i brought out the bottle in celebration with my mates and all of our faces were inexpressive there was no distinctive bang too much bite the aroma has a fairly nice waft but breathing it too close burns the nose we only had one drink and called it a night now i 39 m drinking the bottle alone in order to make room for a standard jack or jameson 1 25 or 1 2 this bottle 39 s age and 1 5 the price this drink does not make me look forward to its consumption i waited a year to drink it and should have waited longer if i go fancy i 39 m sticking to glenfiddich 21 or higher that number 25 on the label has curb appeal but no value on the quality  having tried several of the glenfarclas lineup not including family casks i think i can say that this one fits right in and acts its age it is unmistakably glenfarclas the nose is typical of the distillery though sweeter and perhaps softer it is dangerously drinkable i could see where some might complain of it being too subtle but i don 39 t think that is the case it shouldn 39 t be compared to the likes of aberlour and glendronach  the palate is not my personal favorite but the nose is just mindblowing so much complex sherry watch out though the nose could be addicting if you like sherry  my father is 80 in a week 39 s time and loves glenfarclas 15 year old so i thought i 39 d splash out on something a bit special so i come here to check out the reviews on the glenfarclas 25 but find two that appear to be advertising glengoyne both citing the glengoyne 21 and 25 however the glengoyne 25 is 163 234 so why on earth cite it when reviewing a whisky that costs 163 116 and steve 39 if there really are whiskies in sainsburys costing just 163 20 but the equal of this one please do tell me which ones they are as i can save a lot of money maybe the glenfarclas was just too subtle for your tastebuds  i have to agree with the review below this whisky is in no way complex or rich in flavour when you compare it to the glengoyne 21 and the glengoyne 25 the glengoyne 21 is thick rich and full of flavour the glenfarclas 25 and the 21 are both terribly overpriced and with little flavour  i bought this on the strength of the reviews here but am very disappointed i enjoy the glengoyne 21 and 25 and several glendronach sherried malts the rich fruity taste and long spice finishes the glenfarclas 25 is none of those it 39 s a very subtle whisky there is no strong taste very little taste at all in fact and even the nose is plain and dry this tastes like a cheap 10 year old whisky not unpleasant and certainly drinkable but a macallan 10 many of the the balvenies and even arberlour 12 all have a deeper richer flavour with more complexity and a stronger finish than this and all cost half the price of this i can 39 t see the appeal if you want a light easy drink then spend 163 20 in sainsbury 39 s not over 163 107 on this waste of money when you consider that a glengoyne 21 is the same price chalk and cheese steve this one is a very good refined whisky one that develops curious raw cocoa amp sacher notes that i couldn t find in any other glass in a lineup of their current 15 40 year olds it s nuttier than the rest of the bunch and the one that stands out as a bit of a surprise when you nose the different age bottlings in succession good stuff  i have now sampled all the glenfarclas standard range have to say like them all this is perhaps the best one it s complex but accessible the 40 is great very complex but not sure it s what i want in a speysider 30 i did not really see much difference to this not sure worth the extra outlay 21 again a bit to similar to the 15 and 17 think this and the 12 the prefect couple for any collection as best all round examples of this distillery but that said would not exclude any of the others  smooth and balanced the sherried notes are strong but not over powering the nose has tones of fruit and the taste is like buttery toast as stated by the guys at mom it s the finish where this malt excels as it s long and full excellent  opened this on my daughters first birthday one of the best whiskeys i have ever drunk this is a sherried finish heavyweight  simplement merveilleux really nice and fresh but complex enough nice dried fruit cinnamon and cocoa notes along with sherry and bit of oak some almonds notes in aftertaste this is one of my all time favorites if you want serious sherry monster look no further glenfarclas and glendronach sorry not macallan povilas lovely no menthol just ripe apples and fruits great taste lovely oaky sweetness which you can chew for ages above review was meant for the 30 year old hehe that ll teach me to drink all 5 drams in a tasting set so quickly this is a stunner only tries a sample so far but this bottle is on my future purchase list  we tried this together with older glenfarclas but i think this beauty was the best
62132.0, can you say this is a deep single malt depth of flavor is a better description agree with oak and pine  good smooth whisky with some sherry in it for an affordable price the thrill is the price less than 38 dollar for 1 litre of 12 year old highland whisky is a bargain where i live but the 15 is a lot better if you can afford it you get more sherry with glendronach 12 but about the same overall quality as with this one  bought a liter of this last week and just cracked it open on the nose was sherry and oak the palate revealed burnt toffee chocolate citrus zest and that oak long malty finish with oak and toffee after water there was turpentine on the nose the chaps above said pine resin so maybe that s what i was detecting and stewed prunes this is a very good quality and affordable daily dram whisky  clearly the previous review drank the full bottle before writing his or her review i 39 ve just bought a standard 75cl bottle from m amp s for 163 26 which is an utter bargain sorry mom smooth nose gentle initially on the palate reasonably full mouthfeel as the fruitcake and mince pies cut through i was however expecting a bit more and i don 39 t rate it as high as jim murray it 39 s not a patch on a 39 bunadh but then that 39 s a different proposition it 39 s definitely preferable to balvenie double wood it 39 s smoother and more complex but yet to compare to glendronach that 39 s for next week ultimately it 39 s just a bit too smooth for my tastes i like a bit more fire to play with  не съм доволен но на тази цена изпихме ги 2 215 1l 43 176  nice
2079.0, disrespectful to the consumer and the spirit itself to give it 18 years in wood only to dilute it to 40 poor form that unsurprisingly results in a thin whisky without character or depth the 15yo solera is the glenfiddich worth buying until they release an older bottle with more integrity  smooth yes but lacking in flavour a higher abv is needed for this to be taken seriously as a lower price 18 year old for aunties to buy for the 18th birthday of nephews amp nieces it is smooth and universally acceptable for new drinkers but unexceptional by other 18 yo standards highland park talisker glenlivet will appeal more to seasoned malt drinkers would be interesting to try a non chill filtered expression 43 46  this is a good whisky quite sweet due to the sherry cask no doubt but it has a very good balance of flavours it stands up well against other whiskies at this price i by most of mine from the society and i was surprised how good this was to put the price in perspective this will give you 13 doubles to enjoy and sip slowly good wine costs at least 163 15 00 and only gives about 4 glasses per bottle and so comes in at a sumilar price on a cold winter night there is no comparison and you don t wake up with a red wine headache  very nice received as a present and found it smooth and easy to drink not spectacular but certainly very enjoyable  if you want something that 39 s caramely smooth and has just a blush of smoke get this it does not have the most personality nor is it the smoothest but it 39 s awfully good and it should satisfy a lot of different palates  its smooth n has lovely aroma i like it  an extremely smooth dram as an 18yr old really should be even at 40 abv its got a long finish and mouthfeel is nice too cinnamon apples and plenty dried fruits and sherry on show a little vanilla in the end as well being a small batch whisky its not always going to be same even with the vatting procedure no need for water with this either but dont let forst few sips put you off its qualities a damn fine whisky and at reasonable price t 39 boot struth great taste and smooth finish but very harsh on the mouth needs to be watered a bit i bought a bottle of this last night this is by no means the first time i have drunk glenfiddich 18 being a scot quot of a certain age quot i have to say this whisky lacks the character of previous bottles it tastes a little thin as if it has been filtered or toned down i suspect that the barrels used were a bit tired not for the first time have i drawn this conclusion recently it 39 s still a nice drop but it does lack quot oomph quot ten years ago glenfiddich 18 was thick challenging a quot serious quot dram now it is polite this is extremely unfortunate was bought a bottle of this by my son amp daughter for my 60th birthday always liked glenfiddich even though i tend to drink others nowadays but this one has been pretty awesome even managed to eke it out until almost 61st birthday most enjoyable  i 39 m here in colorado bought a firearm and feller from bigr who sold it too me is from scottland so while sitting waiting he tells me nothings finer than true single malt scotch whiskey so i of course gotta get some i find a bottle i like i stop back buy and as him if glenfiddich would be up to his liking i paid 120 for my bottle he said absolutely fine scotch there you have so went home drinking it and drinking a 60 minute ipa beer i like to mix my fine scotch with very fine expensive beers while i enjoy some video gaming i 39 m a business owner doing a million dollars a year in business and need to rest my mind this scotch hits me with notes of smell that makes me think of scotch candy itself it 39 s smooth and each small shot begins tasting different to me various new spectrums of flavors hit my tongue sweet malty notes slight pepperish burn at first and 4th shot down smooth woody sweetness the complexity is in it 39 s shot for shot different aroma and taste to the drinker i 39 m absolutely happy with this scotch i 39 ve had johnny walker but this is on a whole different level higher than a blue label i 39 d say but for half the price and i 39 m a blue label jw fan with the bottle in my cabinet as i type this but i think i 39 ll spend my bucks here this 18yr liquor is where your dollars at cody absolute masterpiece for the price  this was my first time trying the glenfiddich and it 39 s now one of my favorites  simply awesome no words exuberant experience  notes of sherry ginger spice and some toffee very smooth with a fruity palate enjoyed over ice delicious and easy drinking  pear taste and sweet this expression consists of vatted whiskies rather than the much more commonplace additional cask enhancement which consists of finishing for a short period of time in a european cask vatting means that the whisky has spent long periods in exbourbon and exsherry casks separately and then brought together and married in a large vat vatting creates deeper richer more intense flavours and greater complexity which is what happens here with this 18 year old a very very nice expression indeed but it would be improved by increasing the alcohol strength to say 46 abv as the additional strength would greatly enhance the flavour i am sure most people would pay the additional premium for the improvement in flavour profile still that notwithstanding this is a very nice expression  best i have ever tried yet price 39 s fair enough too  while i have read reviews both pro and con on the quality of the glenfiddich 18 year old small batch offering my personal reaction was to find this single malt utterly delicious others comments cite lack of bite while anothers comment on its floral mild citrus character and milder smokiness i suggest anyone doubting to invite a tasting of speysides of similar age and price the glenfiddich 18 will hold its own and then some i generally enjoy my scotch neat or with a quarter spoon of filtered water cheers david louden usn e9 retired  wow what can i say this is just fantastic my absolute favourite of favourites beautiful aromas of vanilla rich dried fruit apple cinnamon and baking spices and much the same in the taste with a long sweet spicy finish another flawless quality malt from glenfiddich  under 163 66 for an 18 year old single malt from a reputable distiller still people are bleating about it ridiculous this is a fine fine single malt 18 years old and at a great price but it s never enough is it i appreciate different tastes but by no measure is this not a feckin superb whisky so put your puerile complaints to bed  the last bottle i bought about 18 months ago had more oomph and less sweetness was more complex and more quot chewy quot first time i 39 ve seen this square box i like this dram but can 39 t help feeling it 39 s been softened for the mass market still worth buying but i really hope they go back to the older style or offer it as an alternative  one of the best scotches i have ever enjoyed much to my mistake i offered it at a party and the whole contents enjoyed by several that is why i have to restock and save it for myself  i d give this five stars if it was 25 cheaper this is a scotch that s easy to drink but memorable at the same time due to the baked apple and cinnamon notes you d definitely be able to identify it in a blind taste test due to its distinguished nose and taste finish is great as well hangs around for a long time after drinking mine is actually 43 not sure if the abv varies this is a scotch you can bust out for any occasion that can be enjoyed by all pick one up if you see it like i said before my only complaint is i think it could be a little cheaper but i do keep going back to it anyway despite that so the pros definitely outweigh the cons on this one overall i m giving it 4 5 stars  this whisky creates a sublime atmosphere a spiritual taste well rounded and wafts upward beyond the beyond  incredible value at gbp 58 from heathrow duty free  on the nose this single malt is sweet and aged allow it to breathe for a moment or two to open up a true cacophony of sweet brilliance prepare for salivation on the nose you will receive the massaging effects that only an lovingly aged single malt can bring then some roasted fruits and nuts and sweet sweet creme br 251 l 233 e the flavour has some real staying power too a masterpiece as simple and as great as that  love it but the woody taste can get overpowering after a few rich and smooth  very disappointed with the 18 a very bitter after taste not smooth as a comparable glenmorangie 18 or glenlivet taste more like a burnt toffee awesome but if you think it 39 s a little sharp you must try glenlivit with a lot of ice and just a splash of water it is by far the smoothest between oban and glenfiddich and absolutely delicious oban packs a punch of floral up in your sinuses pete  very smooth but still delightfully complex would buy again  a great balanced drink with a delicate yet complex palete slightly sharper than some other fine malts i would recommend it certainly as it 39 s a fine experience  tried it first time in inverness  this little beauty will put a smile on your face no doubt about it it 39 s a great dram for any whisky lover but the real beauty of it is it 39 s delicate complexity some of the many notes have to be searched for such as the light dusting of cacao just before the finish but they are all there without dominating the others fair price you won 39 t be dissapointed sip it roll it over your gums and enjoy  everywhere i always see this as 40 yet the bottle i purchased says 43 so i am kind of confused that mystery aside i found it to be very astonishing and enjoyable my very first bottle of 18 year old and well worth the 95 i shelled out for it at my local grocery store  excellent probably the best whisky in glenfiddich 39 s core lineup there is a reason why glenfiddich is the top selling single malt  one of those once in a lifetime drinks rich powerful and individual  not sure about all the baked apple zesty spicy grapefruit and ginger crap that people talk about it smells nice and tastes even nicer very smooth and warming if you think it burns then stick to uncultured colonial drinks this is one very fine malt whisky no words can describe the wholeness of this whisky rich deep smooth the best bourbon and oloroso sherry casks left their marks on every drop highly recommended  it 39 s fine feels weak and not so smooth i expected to much more  fine balance with a lasting finish one of my favourite noggins along with glenmorangie 18 and the glenlivet 18 of course when i can afford them  marvelous tick vg costly but worth it  found this on sale locally for 62usd forget the fact it 39 s worth every damn penny i feel like i stole it my journey with single malts began with mccallan 10 triple cask fine oak but as my palette developed i gravitated to the smokey islays and one particular japanese whisky while i maintain a few speysides as mainstays in my cabinet in addition to the cannon fodder glen 12s i 39 ve historically kept both the aforementioned mccallan and the sherry casked 12 yo on hand the glenfiddich 18 has elevated my appreciation of speysides to a whole new level this whisky is dangerously delectable and has become my go to for a nice evening dram with or without a cigar there is nothing i can add to the well documented notes on the nose and palette that hasn 39 t already been said  wow smooth carmel and honey backround of the oak and left with a creamy greek yogurt flavour this rare 18 is a special single  heaven is like this wonderfully balanced with a nice dry finish begging you to take the next sip hard to put it down  glenfiddich 12 yo was an intro to the whisky world for me very easy one to enjoy but complex enough to see the difference between regular blends and single malt after a couple of years i was curious how the older brother might taste so i tried the 18 yo well for me it is just not worth the money it seem s tome like a bit better version of the 12 yo so bold with no finish i think it is overpriced a big time you can get macallan even the lowest one and it will give you more joy ale for the same money you can get my favourite glenmorangie nectar d or and you will enjoy lot more than this for me it is a big disappointment i have got to say  this one is really easy and very very good i only wish the finish would be longer  initially i was a little underwhelmed by this i am a huge fan of glenfiddich though less so than the glenmorangie glenlivet glendronach or bunahabhain nonetheless i expected an 18 yr old to have complexity depth and character the nose is a little flat the dominant aroma being a slightly spicy toffee it doesn 39 t really fill the glass or the senses though the palate is mostly vanilla quite strong chocolate a little citrus more pomelo than grapefruit it is smooooooth on the tongue and goes down with no burn or unpleasant pepperiness very balanced a bit like a kavalan podium but with a bit more oak quite a compliment to kavalan by the way hold it in the mouth for a minute or so though run it around your gums a few times swallow then open your mouth and aaaaahhh the chocolate vanilla pepper ginger this is actually a pretty bloody good dram made for late night drinking with a friend or better still alone when nobody is distracting you reminds me a bit of the glenmorangie signet at a fraction of the price and with a little more bite  saw a review whisky com but it didnt live up to the complements nice dram but not nearly as complex as an 18 year old drop should be in my opinion highend pricewise not so highend sherry whisky wise  one of my favorites the cinnamon red apples and toffee really come through nicely with a medium to long rich finish always have an extra bottle on the shelf for a back up  good quite remarkable for the price  i just had this last night as part of my scotch whisky advent calendar i was pleasantly surprised by this whisky i agree wholeheartedly with the overall assessment of this dram buy some  good it is good enough and worth about 60 for a bottle not as good as an aberlour 18 or macallan 18 but good enough for a lower price point not complex almost like a sherried blended whisky  great excellence  my favorite 18 yr old speyside rich nose of baked apples and cinnamon and a wonderfully scrumptious palate with tons of dried fruits and toffee fudge beautifully balanced and dangerously easy to drink in the words of brian kinsman it 39 s quot incredibly distinguished quot  the best whisky i have ever tasted and i have had balvenie 17 doublewood  it would take hours for me to find all the proper words of praise for this adult beverage  not very complex light watery feel mouth finish is short bit of spice  it 39 s the most generic name in scotch there is i bought a bottle a few years ago thought somewhere between quot meh quot and quot yuck quot and proclaimed i 39 d never get another one i finally decided to give it another chance assuming i 39 d regret it and get to write mean things but disappointingly it 39 s quite excellent i don 39 t know if it 39 s year to year variation or if my palate has just changed i remember a lot of bitterness and can 39 t find any bitterness at all this time but this is one of my favorites in recent memory it 39 s sweet smooth fruity without being overly so fresh a little spiced oaky and easy the mom taste notes have it right on the money definitely an excellent beginner scotch but has plenty for the lagavulin loving connoisseur as well no smoke don 39 t get me wrong there i feel almost guilty rating it a 9 i 39 d probably give it full marks if it weren 39 t for the brand but i 39 m sure glenfiddich will do just fine regardless so take that for the record my bottle says 43 abv batch 3308 purchased in usa  i did not expect anything outsanding knowing how standard and plain the glenfiddich 12 tastes what a surprise the nose is highly vegetal and fruity i definitely agree on the baked apples then the palate is so balanced very fruity and gently again notes of apples the finish is long and smooth with still the apples great but definitely not worth 74 eur not worth more than 50  novice to whisky first bottle i purchased was balvenie 12 and thought it 39 s was decent today i purchased the glenfiddich 18 and wow much better i guess i 39 ll keep exploring varieties and enjoying  average it is not bad but it should be fine taste single malt instead it tastes as a little better version of an average commercial whiskey overpriced and overrated imo  go for the 15 year old solera this one burns lots of flavours but it is not smooth  well it 39 s christmas so figured i 39 d treat myself to some of this incredible whisky totally different animal from the 12 year a deep sweet oak with notes of caramel apples and molasses some cinnamon and perhaps a hint of chocolate incredibly smooth and mine is bottled at 43 so even more impressive best thing i 39 ve had from glenfiddich for sure time makes a huge difference with this one cheers the sugarbear i started drinking whiskeys with glenfiddich 12 yo and then 18yo this one is a nice solid whiskey however i find most glenfiddich too sweet nice but not one of my favourites  it 39 s ok but i can think 5 bottles that are better for this price and 5 more bottles that are better for half this price so sweet wood spicy dry that 39 s it it 39 s drinkable and even enjoyable but for the price it 39 s not something i will pick up again  splendid stuff  rather expensive but a lovely smooth taste well worth a go  i wouldn 39 t usually buy glenfiddich as their ubiquitous green bottle to me is the most standard boring single malt you can name got a 20cl bottle of this one at duty free before a flight for clandestine swigging to save me paying ryanair tons of dosh for tiny bottles of something nasty anyway very good indeed so good it made me re evaluate my attitude to choosing whisky based on who made it turns out i also like johnnie walker black label i might just try smokey mountain corn whiskey  beautifully light floral aroma a great big hit of vanilla in there that quot burns like a bad batch of smokey mountain corn whiskey quot guy either got a knock off bottle or simply doesn 39 t know what he 39 s talking about this one 39 s as smooth as you like  drinking scotch is an acquired taste those that believe they 39 ll buy a bottle and enjoy an evening of sipping whiskey because it may be the thing to do to impress a friend are in for a shock prior to consuming glenfiddich take a sip of iced water to cleanse the palette then take a sip a sip not a gulp and attempt to identify the flavors that explode in your mouth i won 39 t describe it you must experience it for yourself enjoy  this is a great buy for the money always enjoy it after each sip the flavor lingers with you definitely one of my favorites within this price range comments by ginutis i am appalled at anyone that would allow the word smooth in the same room as this crap i paid 120 for a bottle of glenfiddich 18 thinking that my friend and i could have an enjoyable evening of scotch sipping of all the scotch i 39 ve had in my life this stuff burns like fire anybody who describes this as smooth doesn 39 t know what they are talking about i am going to tell the store owner how crappy this scotch is and ask that he stop offering it  its fine just nothing great about it i enjoyed the 15 year better  this is one of my all time favorites the baked apple scent on the nose is beautiful well balanced smooth easy drinking a good whisky to introduce a new scotch drinker as well as the glenfiddich 15 as there is no harsh alcohol bite and nothing overpowering about it just smooth and delicious  definitely a must try not overpowering generally agreeable not too far flung in any direction kind of sweet  i 39 ve never been a fan of glenfiddich but this one took me by surprise very well balanced and full of subtle undertones complex enough to be interesting but at the same time good all round so it doesn 39 t get tired after a while so far hands down best in advent calendar and one of best i ever tried  the best advent whisky so far the aroma is intricate with rum raisin bread vanilla and lemon the first sip is slightly peppery and gingery with some rosemary astringency but moves to sherry grapes and toffee the finish recalls the vanilla of the nose with cinnamon rice pudding and lemon this rounded smooth yet complex whisky makes a great gift for the novice or experienced drinker  nose fudge spiced red apple hints of candied orange some white grapes and subtle notes of oak palate toasted oak red apple some raisins and nutmeg finish a fairly long and drying finish notes of grape gingerbread citrus oil and some distant smoke fading to a close  this is really quite a special whisky the marriage of both sherry and bourbon has given a huge level of interest and complexity to the malt really fruity up front full of apple crumble and caramel notes with christmas spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon coming through it finishes with an oaty amaretto infused finish  nice and smooth taste stay longer  fabulous whiskey 15 yr old still does it for me on price and flavour each to there own  shnishe seriously this whisky has immediately kicked me off my high horse and told me not to poo poo glefiddich whiskies just because they make a zillion bottles a year lacks the authentic artisan touch you see wtf do i know trouble is it s bloody magic i now have to explore the rest of the range  good whisky but not as good as the 15 years old have been drinking this for more than 2 years bloody brilliant it is just got thier select cask would let you know how that is maddu ind best whisky by far quot smooth quot most superior i didn t know this drink but i had to google it after some sips from a bottle given to me by a friend very mild and friendly taste yet gives all you want from fine whiskey i wish i had googled it before gulping all cos i may not afford another bottle now i have also checked for its retail outlet but no way yet another great and high experience godson port harcourt nigeria referring to ancient mistake isn t the ancient reserve the same thing as the current 18yo glenfiddich just don t put ancient reserve on the label anymore certainly all sites advertising the ancient reserve just illustrate a standard 18yo bottle i was given a small bottle of 18yo last month and thought it great though i m more of an islay fan but oddly ralfy mentioned in one of his reviews that he won t be reviewing the 18yo as it doesn t reach 80 100 very odd the 18yo seemed much better than the 15yo to me  i won t get into all that pretentious horseshit about quot notes quot of this and quot notes quot of that and quot pairs quot well with a pair of whore s drawers its a great phucking whisky if you can afford it and i can and more than that it stimulates the creative senses and inflames the genitals and makes you want to rob banks and go for drives in the countryside with law enforcement and gunfire seriously its a great whisky and well worth the 80 00 bucks can sign me regards don lairddogtown bastardalberta canada i probably have 50 bottles of whiskey this is one of my all time favorite and go to bottles the warm spiced apples are just yummy  a rather sweet very fruity whisky very delicate mellow and soft a finish with toffee is very pronounced i initially wanted to save this one for a long time so i poured a very small amount in the glass the taste lasted in my mouth for the next 2 hours and it was simply beautiful be wary of the glass you drink it with as it does make a difference  quite simply a taste of the quot gods quot i smile every time i take a sip i refer to the quot a truly awful whisky quot reviewer a ridiculous review that is of no use to anyone why is it an awful whisky this basically this is a good whisky but for me the 15yo has more depth and complexity  apples apples apples hint of sherry apples sweet great bottle  the smoothness of what you look for when you invest in an 18year old very affordable and underrated bottle  absolutely wonderful 18 yr old single malt i bought two bottles 3 yrs ago just opened the second its stunning delicate smooth mellow and that famous warmth as you swallow it down slowly worth every penny and more  this is a gem beautifully balanced aromatic a classic speysider  i see one bad review about the whisky and i don t understand how anyone could say that about it i understand if you don t like the place you bought it from but this is one of the best whiskies for that price that one can get been drinking this for years and it is fantastic never ordered from this site so i can t comment on the service  i love this whisky for its smoothness and caramel apple cinnamon flavours the best way i can describe it is to imagine angelina giving you a lingering french kiss while half way through eating and licking on a toffee apple once i get started on a bottle of this its hard for me to put it down in errrr what id imagine would be a similar way to mrs pitt  another great whisky from the underrated glenfiddich distillery one of the smoothest and bueatifully honey sweetened whiskies out there however if your used to your whiskies bottled at 46 and ncf you may find it somewhat lacking in ommph  this is a fantastic whisky not for everyday drinking but for the cozy nights in front of the fire perfect the people that are complaining and downvoting the whisky becouse of a shipping error should stay with jack d  i took me almost a whole year to finish this 1 liter bottle of glenfiddich and while i m somewhat of a novice when it comes to whisky in general i know that i prefer speyside whisky compared to those that originate from islay and i was very pleased with this bottle and the smoothness it contains it s like a semi sweet well rounded richness coats your tongue and the warmness of it all  thank you for your review we are very sorry about the mistake made in your order and would like to fix this for you please drop an email to the customer service team with your order number and we will make sure you get the correct bottle again we apologise for the inconvenience caused to you and hope to be able to rectify this quickly contactus masterofmalt com 01892 888 376 the chaps from master of malt this has got to be one of the worst whiskys i have ever tasted it is very harsh on the mouth  they sent me the wrong whisky they sent me the regular 18 year old not the ancient reserve so my review is poor this is the second time i have posted this so they obviously don t like negative reviews i think they sent me the wrong whisky on purpose  i ordered and payed for a bottle of glenfiddich 18 year old ancient reserve but received a bottle of 18 year old glenfiddich so my review extremely poor  i have always been a fan of glenfiddich i have tried from the 12 to the 21 year old and a lot of the limited edition ones too my favourite is the 1991 don ramsey bottle then this one i think this is better than the 21 year old i am not a fan of peaty or smokey whisky but this one has a tiny hint of smoke that works well with the other flavors to top it off i got 6 bottles of this in morrisons for 29 99 each bargain  sweet water with some wood you can get more even for lower price  a good whisky but not as good as the glenfiddich 15 in my opinion  this lad is as delicate as an old lady but has enough kick to convert a try my favorite whisky to date jackie jr mellow nutty and smooth rich and delicate with no alcohol burn and a fantastic whisky overall glenfiddich are the biggest and this whisky shows that they are also one of the best  mellow nutty and smooth rich and delicate with no alcohol burn and a fantastic whisky overall glenfiddich are the biggest and this whisky shows that they are also one of the best  don t let the fact that glenfiddich are the biggest sellers of single malt whisky put you off they sell more because they produce high class malts and this is a beauty many malts finished in sherry casks are overwhelmed by the rich sherry flavours sometimes purposely to disguise a poor malt but in this case the oloroso adds to the already rich mix of orange ginger and toffee the end result is one of the very best 18 yo on the market at a truly bargain price 
2527.0, in south africa we get it at 43 what a perfect whisky one note that stands out for me is liquorice liquorice all sorts the ones you get with the coloured little balls on i can drink this all day long not a scotch drinkerand its the hardest drink for me to likebut this is very nice smooth like velvet no burn whatsoever tastes like pears to me pricey but il get it again sometime  one of my favourite malts the xtra 3 abv over the 40 12 yo makes a significant difference as well as the age noting earlier review do make sure you get the 43 the 100 proof red lion 15 yo even better but no longer available one of the best i have tasted please bear in mind that this whisky is not the award winning glenlivet 18 this glenlivet 18 is 40 the award winning whisky is 43 the difference in taste is substantial  the best 1 tuath glass showing russetmuskat the nose shows extremely forward smooth and round notes of red and green apples with hints of vanilla and ripe oranges the palate is extremely smooth with round notes of orange and light vanilla fantastic  the glenlivet 18 year old is a must for tasting amp savouring it 39 s a classy dram that oozes quality that never varies my qreatest wish is that i could afford a bottle every week i must also say that bunnahabhain 12 year old is up there with the glenlivet 18 year old i 39 ve tried all the other glenlivets 12 21 n 224 dura amp every other expression but the 18 year old is a dram apart i would heartedly recommend it  smooth very good  i thought it was very smooth without any bite excellent  i ve had somewhere in the region of around 30 40 different drams this is my favourite i need to taste it alongside the 21 and 15 hopefully over christmas i do however believe that the 15 offers more value for money  i took it upon myself to have a tasting alongside a glenfiddich 15 old solero glenlivet 18 a glenmorangie 18 and a hibiki master 39 s select which you can sadly no longer get the glenlivet was the whisky that got me into scotch as my grandad had a bottle on his cabinet for many years it is still superb and the creamy manuka honey really does come though i would say this was slightly pipped by the glenmorangie though impo even though it is slightly more vibrant in flavour  excellent very very nice if you are looking to take the next step above the glenlivet 14 this is very recommend enjoy  my bottle is lkpm4122 1651 2018 09 26 opened for a good 1 week hall of bootle gone go figure all my cognacs xos latest 63 65 abunadhs best jack sbs woodford jack rye chivas 18 zacapa xo and many more they all went to pause mode i could have read you all the stuff from the bottle and the box but i will go easy on you moderately sweet fruity slightly woody the wood is the best i cant explain in words but you can taste its about 20y old smooth as a mf this is an amazing step up to a 12y and 15y i had about 10 20 bottle of glenlivet 12 back in the days good batches before discontinuation few years back just can not compare glenlivet 18 is very close to being the best i had i think i will stock few bottles for rainy days before scotland exits eu  an exceptional whiskey i love it all over  one word superb  the gentle smoke doesn 39 t overpower the mix of flavors present in this fine scotch well worth the price and excellent with a fine cigar this is my absolute favourite of the speyside whiskies has been for years and imagine the end of the line is nearing for this batch hence the quite rapid price hike in last 3 years like most whiskies i find stumbling upon them a better experience or an offering from a friends house expectations is a killer imo glad i found this one the way i did i just loved it i bought this a few short weeks ago read all the comments watched all the reviews on youtube poured my glass waited a good 20 minutes then tasted it all i got was very strong alcohol not pleasant at all yes adding water helped but this was soooooo disappointing it will be a very long time before i return to glenlivet 18 again  not bad but i was expecting much more from it i just drink a dram of aultmore12 and pour one from gl18 and realized it 39 s not better i was expecting more  honey spice sherry and a long pleasant oaky finish a dram is my reward at the end of a busy week i usually suggest glenlivet 18 to friends who haven t yet fallen in love with scotch it s a very likable single malt complex and aromatic  this is a go to scotch for any scotch veteran who comes home after a hard day at work and wants to enjoy a relaxing and dram the nose is delish flower petals honey cherries sweet sherry a sip and it begins to explode to a spicy sweet leather and dried fruit taste and finishes long and delectable i love my 18yo highland park talasker glendronach revival lagavillin 16 so many but as a value for a hundred if you can swing it glenlivet 18 is hard to beat as a treat being a fan of islay peated malts this is a venture into the unknown for me the smell is very sweet resembling with a stretch a glass of sherry but its pleasant and nice to just whiff the taste is a surprise much rougher then the younger speysides ive had a bit of water helps but this is not a sweet malt dry with a bite i personally can taste cherries but a lot of wood and spiciness an interesting stop on my trip through single malts for us avid beginners its entertaining to taste a laphroaig 10 which is iodine peat and sea on the nose but sweetness on the taste and the next day try the glenlivet which is sweetness and friendliness on the nose followed by dryness on the mouth  wow i 39 m new to 18yo 39 s and have tried oban and glenfiddich now this of the three this one is the smoothest over ice with a splash of water by far the easiest to drink i would say this is a great one for someone buying their first 100 18 you could easily drink three or four glasses of this at a sitting and not feel overwhelmed by the fact that you 39 re drinking hard liquor the taste that stands out to me is toffee  love the 18 year old keep the tradition don 39 t stop using sherry cask i 39 m afraid this isn 39 t for me as i sip on it now i feel that it tastes sweet and slightly sour possibly from the apples with a contrast spiciness wood and smoke with a hint of mint but for me personally it doesn 39 t work it has a fairly pleasant aftertaste but the initial sip is awful just need to add this in i am not a scotch expert so my view is rudimentary but i 39 m sure most people aren 39 t scotch experts either so i 39 m addressing to the majority i feel little smoothness with this beverage and it doesn 39 t go down quite as easily as i 39 d likethe aroma it smells like a strong over powering cider and that 39 s off putting for me a good scotch is king alexander iii by dalmore glenlivet 18 has a taste that needs to be acquired well for me anyways but the best things are an acquired taste it 39 s a shame i watched a review on this and it got and great review i really wanted to like it but i think this should be reserved for veteran scotch drinkers as a juxtaposing review on ka iii my favourite got an alright rating not a quot top 5 quot if you are fairly new to scotch like me and need your palate development like me then i do recommend kaiii it 39 s full and heavy but not overpowering it 39 s extremely smooth like someone liquefied silk or velvet and made it taste warm and inviting as for this whisky buy it if you want but i 39 d wait until your palate has been enriched with others all this aside i 39 m going to give it a 3 it 39 s not undrinkable but my palate just rejects the taste and my nose rejects the smell  had a couple of bottles over the years and absolutely love it very good this one of the best scotches i have had the pleasure of drinking loved it  i 39 ve been a big fan of the glenlivet 18 for around 8 years having enjoyed 5 6 bottles over a couple of years but last one was about 3 years ago i 39 ve had this lingering dream of what it was like but having bought it now i feel disappointed perhaps my taste has changed but the flavour i remember was more sweet and honey flavored not this oak and burnt after taste is it me or is glenlivet doing a founders reserve special on this normally fantastic beverage seriously questioning myself  never was a daily whisky drinker i 39 ve found most whiskies harsh with a burn that made it very unpleasant however i find the 18 year though not quot smooth quot per se to be very drinkable to a novice like me will definitely continue to sip this very fine scotch  excellent scotch  i 39 ve never tasted better i don 39 t have hundreds to spend on a bottle so i probably never will i 39 ll definitely have another bottle at some point  the nose and taste are stupendous with all the complexity and intensity one would expect from a top shelf scotch the finish lingers for hours the alcohol quality is far beyond the competition providing a wonderfully pleasant and peppy buzz similar to drinking a few glasses of dom p 233 rignon i ve never had even a hint of a hangover from any of the glenlivet line the 18 packs that extra 86 proof punch while still being just as smooth as the 15 the glenlivet 18 is worth every cent of its 100 price though the 12 and 15 are better values overall the 18 is a special occasion dram that will instantly punctuate a great achievement with an exclamation point cheers  it is a very good whisky the nose is especially fantastic overall though i would say that the glenlivet 15 is smoother and a nicer experience overall for about half the money  this is a great scotch one of the best i have ever tasted a true gem one of the best 18yo speyside single malt whisky  john mac melb australia love it done tour of glenlivet this is my very first bottle of single malt whisky i used to drink blended whisky the usual jack daniel no 7 black lable chivas 12 etc ever since i 39 ve tried quite a few others such as the glenfarclas 18 glenfiddich 18 glenlivet 15 glenlivet triple cask macallan select oak macallan 12 fine oak aberfeldy 18 glenmorangie 10 balvenie 16 balvenie 17 highland park recently bought a bottle of blue lable to try out but at the end of the day i always find myself going back to the glenlivet 18 it is just that wonderful it is so balanced it is sweet but not too sweet the oakiness isn 39 t over powering love the long lasting taste this is without doubt my favourite whisky  i have ventured into the world of older whiskies lately this was my first 18 year old purchase the nose for me is sweet fruity apples and oranges along with honey and a hint of apricots as an aside my wife does not like strong liquor especially the smell but when i got her to take a sniff she actually really liked it tasting did not go so well back to me on the palate it is sweet but not overly so i get slight orange peel caramel honey and some nuttiness there is a nice burst of flavours initially which stays throughout but never overpowering the finish is gradual smooth and buttery with no burn not a fan of the burn which makes it even better i know some feel this might lack character or is quot bland quot but i really enjoyed this one and think the bottle will disappear quickly sometimes i 39 m in the mood for some bite and or strong aromas and other times feel like a relaxing easy to drink whisky that doesn 39 t shock the senses this one fits the bill perfectly for me  one of the best  one of the best 18y single malt whisky  from the beginning taste to the after taste to the smoothness this is consistently one of the best whiskey that i 39 ve had i prefer this over the blue label blue label is a bit smoother but it lack the flavor profile that the glenlivet 18 provides this is one of my go to bottles drink it neat that 39 s the only way to go  good not great a little thin and a little burn st the end for an 18 yr old dalwhinnie 15 for example is smoother with better flavor  simply put an exceptional single malt wonderful notes of cereal and a spot of honey smooth and soft on the palate long lingering finish a very satisfying dram well worth the price  not for me too spicy i prefer glenfiddich 18 worth every penny great addition to your bar  great drop great value for money cant go wrong adding this to your bar  great value for money but nowhere near the royal brackla 16  save 20 and by the dalmore vintage 2004 and have a better whisky experiense this is a scotch with no real flaws and a lot of very strong positives a quot classic quot in every way no flash no gimmick just an excellent product think of it as very very very good vanilla ice cream the triple fudge ripple rocky road toffee may sound sexier but at the end of the day the simple excellence of the product more than makes up for lack of a gimmick an older dalmore is a good match and mortlack from the old owners were in the same league but among the stuff out there now this is a very very good scotch at what is all told a quite reasonable price if you want to give a scotch drinker a nice gift this is a very safe choice  one of the smoothest and finest scotch i have had the pleasure of sipping  take a 12 year old a 15 year old a 18 year old and a 21 year old and stick them in the same classroom the 12 year old is too nervous too young the 15 year is genius but it is immature the 18 year symbolises all you can hope for and all that has gone before finally the 21 year is outspoken and one must suspect that it is pushing age over beauty i love glenlivet 18 it 39 s a solid good value 18 year whisky that doesn 39 t need to pretend its just quot top of it 39 s price class quot congrats best regards  i had the glenlivet master 39 s reserve which was rubbish this is on the other hand one of the best i ever had i got it for about 70 bucks for a liter bottle at the seattle duty free what a find i will try to buy as many bottles as i can next time i also had the 15 year and thoug that is also delicious to an extent i think 18 is where glenlivet his it 39 s stride  harsh and bitter burns and leaves a hot aftertaste it 39 s my first and last bottle of glenlivet  good i stayed away from this because i had a fiddich 18 and wasn 39 t impressed i cheated myself this is sooooo good from the nose to the finish it 39 s like an angel peeing on your tongue  tried this a long time ago along with the 15 and glenfiddich 15 and 18 wasn 39 t impressed by either because the glenfiddich 39 s just seemed so much better at the time but trying them again now actually quite surprised how good they are all the pear apple goodness you 39 d expect from the livet but with a smooth buttery oak backbone this stuff is great glad i gave it a second chance although i still think glenfiddich 18 was better but i probably need to have that again too it has been awhile anyways great scotch smooth and flavorful definitely a bigger fan of glenlivet now after this cheers the sugarbear while many speyside scotches are smooth they are not always deep this one has excellent taste for that genre would have given it a five star review it had highland tenses delicious buttery speyside whisky fairly oaky and ever so slightly smoky the finest glenlivet i have ever tried i wonder as an ex pipeman how it would have tasted with a sasieni 4 dot pot of exmoor hunt seasoning the room beautiful simply beautiful  just straight up pleasure in your mouth i 39 m a fan  great whiskey enjoyed a bottle of this at our weekly cigar sabbatical didn 39 t last the night great taste and wonderful finish  starts off sweet with a taste of apple and honey then quickly goes oaky with lots of sharpness the contrast is so enthralling a bottle never lasts more than 2 days around here  fantastic flavour and feel to the pallet  one of the nicest malts i 39 ve tasted  i love variation which is why the world of whisky is so exciting i 39 ve got to say that this is one of my favourite you can reach for this regardless of your mood and sit back and enjoy it just wonderful  a delicate and delicious mixture was enjoying it is welcome at a hard day to enjoy this whiskey fresh and a little stronger aftertaste notes ideal for those who enjoy drinks soul  i love the subtle apple notes and rich flavor allow it to breath at least 5 minutes before enjoying  from nose to finish this is a good dram it has delicate notes of apple oak and something sweet sherry maybe and rarely have i had the pleasure of such a smooth whisky but it lacks the complexity and depth to make the jump from being good to being great while i wouldn 39 t hesitate to recommend this i feel that the highland park 18yo is a better choice in the same age and price range though it can be almost overpoweringly sweet at times so i could see this as a drier alternative some days i think that this is good enough that i 39 ll probably be keeping a bottle of this in my cabinet from now on  it 39 s bad if you take a sip right away you need to let it sit for at least 10 minutes if not even longer to let the flavours really come out don 39 t add water it 39 s too delicate  taste cheap unpleasant alkogol glenlivet 12 the best  nothing special expected more my personal opinion is that better to buy stratisla 12 it 39 s cheaper and taste it 39 s more fine enjoy bulgaria 27 12 2015 better than the 21 great balanced taste exceptional value for money first bottle only lasted 2 nights the 1st sip to wet my lips that 39 s all i needed excellent job some things are worth waiting for george amp j g smith by far the best single malt i have had  it 39 s very smooth in taste i just send over 800 on 7 bottles what does that tell you  i am very selective with my scotch whiskey i 39 ve tried glenlivet 12 15 and 21 18 is what i prefer and i drink it without ice i am usually a islay islands scotch drinker but this one surprised me there is a slight sherry flavor to a wee bit of smoke i found this at a pub and i am glad i tried it definitely one you have to try on your bucket list  i am very selective with my scotch whiskey i 39 ve tried glenlivet 12 15 and 21 18 is what i prefer and i drink it without ice it 39 s really what you prefer i do not care for any of the johnny walker 39 s or glenfidich i do enjoy chivas 12 and chivas 18 but overall i give glenlivet 18 a perfect 10  compared to the 21 archive i like the 18 much more more spices and better nose sweet better price and much more accessible  i am usually an islay and islands scotch drinker but found this to be a very good dram i wasn 39 t expecting to like it since i have never liked any glenlivits in the past i was pleasantly surprised after giving this one a try  i have found over several tastings that the 12 amp 15 yr expressions are more complex with fruit flavors than the 18 i find the 18 flat or one dimensional age isn 39 t everything a disappointing dram  i find that age isn 39 t everything actually i find the 12 amp 15 yr expressions more complex with fruit flavors i find the 18 yr boring perhaps flat  its a nice mix of flavors quite a bit better that the 12 and 15 soft honey vanilla and a fruit that i haven 39 t completely identified something with a citrus taste  nice and viscous as a lover of young islay i did not expect to like this as much as i do surprisingly excellent  this is a fantastic whisky very smooth and mellow with a light smokiness lingers on the palette beautifully  i just tried a glass of glenlivet 18 year old scotch from a new bottle that i had received as a christmas gift what a disappointment instead of quot smooth and wonderfully balanced quot it was harsh and barely palatable more like cutty sark than a quality scotch  i first tried this whisky in 2014 i am happy to admit my initial review sold this drink short it is an exceptional dram my son just brought me a bottle through duty free it lasted 5 nights absolutely wonderfully dram well rounded full with a wonderful lingering aftertaste i have over 90 bottles of single malt in my shed glenlivet 18 yo is my no 1 at the moment i drink this neat and i love it if there 39 s a better tasting scotch i haven 39 t tasted it  a very smooth flavorful scotch with a mellow finish  before glenfiddich 15 years was my favourite but this bottle just pushed it up a knot  great whisky for the money fresh nose cereals and citrus honey and dark chocolate with orange peel taste stays with you for quite a while so smooth  this one is better than glenfiddich18 definitely will buy again  very good unique taste i like the bit of smoke and the light fruitiness this is my go to favorite i have a bottle of the 21 archive i am opening christmas eve i cant wait  i 39 ve been drinking single malts for many years mccallum 10 yr has been my favourite however i recently tried argbah 18 year and loved the smokey peat flavour the glenlivet 18 yr was a gift from my son who has expensive and quality taste in all things this is a very enjoyably scotch fruity smooth and leaves a fresh clean taste definitely worth a try will buy another newfoundland canada october 2014 when i was in college back in 2001 2005 i started exploring the scotch world and was quickly pointed in the direction of this bottle from the first sip until today i 39 ve always loved this one from the nose to the rich finish it 39 s simply delicious and it 39 s hard to find much fault here i used to be able to get it for around 69 and at that price it 39 s highway robbery but these days it 39 s at least 100 down here in south florida still worth every penny  i turned 21 in august and have been drinking only the glenlivet 39 s scotch since legal at 21 years of age in the usa i have been working my way up the years enjoyed the 15 the best until this one i have tried the 12 15 and 16 nadurra thus far the chaps at master of malt review was spot on i went to my extended spice cabinet to smell my sugar free barley flour and then mixed it with spearmint before nosing the scotch your have a great nose my friend the orange apple and smoke i could smell from the start but the undertone noses i was lacking smell experience until i tested it with my spices the oak is a familiar smell but i was not able to pinpoint it until reading this review the pallet of fennel was a great surprise upon sniffing my spice of fennel which i use in most of my chicken or pork cooking honey and bitters of oak was an obvious finish i have had and love with all glenvliet 39 s scotches i am appreciating the longer finish with this scotch considering this being my most aged scotch tasted it is even longer than the higher abv 16 year nadurra that i am finishing the bottle of currently i love reading reviews as i drink a dram because it allows me to nose palette and finish even more than normal i hope you read this quot chaps at master of malt quot because you deceive much credit for your wisdom in scotches i am so enjoying my 200ml bottle taster sample of the 18 that i will soon be purchasing the 750ml bottle in less than a month cheers to your drams brandon niblett after trying tons of single malts finding this beauty for 49 99 was especially rewarding  one of the best whiskys i have tried going to buy my second bottle now far better than the other speysides i ve tried glenfiddich and balvenie are too cardboardy macallan is too sherry y i can t say i love this prefer a bit stronger malt glen grant old pulteney or peat islay flavor but for a reasonably available speyside this one s got just a touch of sherry sweetness and very little of the cardboardy taste i ve found elsewhere feels more classy than the tasteless obans and scapas i guess to summarize this is the best happy medium if you want a touch of that sherry quot luxury quot and don t like drinking cardboard  orange and sherry nose honey oak and tannins on the palate oaky smooth finish my favorite so far absolutely love this stuff i hosted a tasting recently and most liked this by far the best very smooth  best among all d brands i had so far  very smooth and citrusy and i taste oranges excellent  this is a good dram but i have been trying many in the last few months this one doesn t quite do it for me whilst it is a good drink with beautiful tastes it is not remarkable i am stuck at the moment on glenfarclas 17 yo this classic 18 years speyside dram with a nose of green apples sultry sherry amp a fine wood finish pairs perfectly with our 4 fermentations robusto with plenty of smoke but that brings out the high content cacao flavour roasted coffee toasted dark nuts amp also a long amp fine wood finish enjoy  got a sample bottle of this in a gift set and was not impressed flat on taste and finish  that s the best whisky i ve ever tasted in my life there s nothing i would ever compare with uhm what a nice whisky i must say i can drink this like water it is so freaking good i used to put ice in scotch and now i would horrified if anything molested this beautiful booze i can t comment on the notes too much because i ve recently poured the 12 yo after it not completely sweet a bit sour tangy citrus dried fruits marzipan biscuit buttery leather winter spices then the peat smoke is light and stays on the palate a much nicer whisky than i had anticipated complex wise thanks to the euro casks would be wonderful in port or sherry to open up the fruitier notes or perhaps use more peat to pull out more smoke and astringent flavors next time i ll try with a wee bit of h2o  scent of banana and caramel with cinnamon creamy flavors of lemon and tropical fruit so smooth that it suffers a little in complexity  this is truly great whisky smooth as silk and well rounded similar to a cats scrotum on a hot day tremendous  used to be around 60 but ive been seeing the price go up to about 90  beautiful and strong aroma amazing flavour and extremely smooth will be buying this one again  i ve only been drinking scotch in a serious manner in the last few years and i have been sampling many brands and years to find exactly what i like before i had set on glenmorangie nectar d or as what i keep in my cabinet but after trying the glenlivet 18 i haven t bought another bottle since very smooth and great finish goes absolutely great with a cigar or pipe if that is your thing i smoke a pipe on occasion would recommend to anyone i know who likes scotch or even the newbie who should try good scotch without being turned off to it by drinking bad  it is by far my favourite scotch whisky but i can t believe how cheap it is in america i am from australia and here it costs 105 dollars a bottle and when i saw the price of 59 dollars here i was shocked  smoothest scotch ever tasted  so far this one is my favorite this is truly great whisky smooth as silk and well rounded this is the best whisky on the market in my book smooth as silk with awesome flavor i have a hard time keeping it in my cabinet because it seems to disappear quickly i nearyly choked my brother in law when i found he d poured himself a large bucket of scotch soda using my last bottle of 18 year old bottle is now hidden in the closet  not only is this a truly excellent whisky but it s pretty damned cheap too  absolute liquid gold highly recommended to any scotch drinker out there if you dont like this then your way too hard to please p this is as smooth as it gets no hangover well priced if you want to party like a rock star and keep going this is it  better than blue labe i dont know if my bottling was bad or if this one just isn t for me reminds me very much of the glenfiddich rich oak but much sharper oak fruit in the nose and taste don t find it pleasant at all love the glenfiddich 14yo rich oak doe i enjoyed the flavour the best whiskey i have tested so far given that i m a fan of the glenlivet i was really looking forward to this but i was somewhat disappointed it s by no means bad just a bit one dimensional sweet with lots of apple flavours on the nose and palate but to be perfectly honest i prefer the 12 and its greater vibrancy  this is the best whisky i ever had its worth every penny i enjoy this on sundays as well no hangover at all  noble flowery lacquer aroma moderate spirit with malty and a little bit fruity notes restrained aftertaste with a soft wood delicate enough and calming  good smell aromatic and smoothness in drinking till 2pegs after that no hangover best single malt out there amazing to drink this whiskey its a pleasure love it great long honey taste wonderful fudge and vanilla smells extremely enjoyable whisky tried this after knowing the 12yo it is a beauty indeed balanced and aromatic worths every penny 
31260.0, having just got stuck into my first bottle of the 12yr ncf i find myself utterly confused and even a little annoyed with aberlour i have long been a fan of this distillery the 10yo is a top notch quot entry level quot malt the 12yo 40 is significantly richer more complex and well worth the extra few pounds and of course the cask strength a 39 bunadh is a class act too though way overpriced nowadays and to my tastes at least the 12yo 48 ncf is simply the most sumptuously delicious 12yo speyside ever in the history of whisky and currently practically unobtainable because it is not part of the core range why so come on aberlour keep this stuff coming and don 39 t jack the price up because of favourable reviews like you did with a 39 bunadh and i will certainly keep on buying it regularly as i 39 m sure will a great many others  aberlour 12 ncf is a very good single malt at a great price it s much better than the normal 12 double cask for only a couple dollars more the nose and taste are characterized by baked cherry pie with the buttery pie crust sensations of ncf whisky plums vanilla spice strawberry caramel apples some almonds more on the palate than the nose nutmeg and fig newtons it has a rich smooth mouth feel that coats the palate as it transitions from the dominant sherry cask flavors to the bourbon cask fruits underneath the finish is warming and medium in length with fruit sweetness a pleasant tart sensation cinnamon spice and a dash of oak i think aberlour 12 ncf is as good or better than four of the five batches of a bunadh that i have tried it s not quite a sherry bomb like a bunadh but it s profile works better with the spirit and casks of aberlour it s my second favorite sherry cask regular dram behind macallan 12 sherry cask us 86 proof version and ahead of glendronach 12  wonderful sherried whisky slightly more refined than the a bunadh in my opinion and only surpassed by the magical macallan cask strength yummy this one very good and non chill filtered no added colouring 48 at around 163 40 great value overall buy it 128526  nice dram this one with added water lots of nice flavours and warming flavours good value for money this aberlour 48 er 128526  this was really good actualy a bit above expectations  highly recommended i haven 39 t been disappointed with an aberlour yet  tasty sherry after having a pour of this after macallan and glenlivet 12 it tasted like ethanol and burned the throat on the way down no reason to give this another try  gorgeous on the nose with loads of sherry influence if nosed without adding water really soft as well after adding water the fruits are coming up a lot more with mainly raisins and a mixture of warm and fresh apple on the palate there is a really sweet arrival a bit spicy and a long slightly bitter finish wonderful dram 
1857.0, smooth wonderfully balanced complex and gentle dram one of my favourites for sure  a present from a dear friend even better than the 15 yr old and that s saying something  fail product 15years is best  i recon this is the best whisky i have tasted and believe me i have tasted a few it s mild peaty and yet fruity taste combined with a hint of caramel is just right for me i would defiantly recommend this whisky  beautiful a gift from a mate for my 50th very smooth  i 39 m just a redneck from georgia usa who enjoys scotch i ordered this at a trendy restaurant and it was hot sh tuff man talk about good spirits if i was in a drinking mood i bet i could suck up half a fifth average rating 4 stars really 5 stars easy you can 39 t get better than this you just can 39 t  really smooth flavour develops beautifully just the right amount of smoke smooth smokey and peat base very enjoyable to drink and enjoy  beautiful colour light smokeyness with a deep thick sweetness amazing long deep finish an absolutely amazing dram even for those not keen on islay malt  i really enjoyed this very easy to drink creamy and rounded single maltlovely colour nose and finish not corrosive on the throat at all been buying this for a few years after it was suggested to me as a comparison to the highland 18 cracked this open the other day with a couple of buddies nice aroma soft peat and smoke toffee and caramel notes tastes figs and prunes very smooth buttery i was very pleased  blistering taste for an 18 year old expected it to be smoother as to the aftertaste can 39 t taste none blast my uneducated tongue it will be quite sad for me to say that i could not taste the difference between this and a 12 year old darn back to my lagavulin and laphroaig  my lovely daughter bought this for my 63rd it is a wonderfully smooth drink with bucket loads of flavours the quot cigar quot overtones are particularly strong but a very refreshing drink as islay whiskeys always tend to be disappointing expected better nose loads of sherry exuding berry notes particularly a dark raspberry conserve some distant peat smoke and aromatic vanillataste sharp sherry sweetness followed by chocolate and coffee notes which blend togetherfinish subtle smoke lasts through and raisins with dark cigar notesoverview a really great whisky lose the colouring and bottle at a higher strength and it could have been a new favourite it s great it s excellently balanced and complex but it needs time the reason why it may sometimes get a lower score is because it s 18 years it looks dark but it s just not that intense take your time with this and you will truly enjoy and appreciate it  nicest whisky i 39 ve ever had so peaty so smokey but still manages to be smooth a real step up on the 12 which i also really really like  tasted it yesterday and i gotta say i was quite disappointed with this dram while bowmore 12 and 15 are amongst my favorite bowmore 18 has nothing different to offer than the 12 i 39 m glad i got to try it before i bought the actual bottle 128 cad it 39 s worth keeping your money for something else imo  islay single malt smakar fruktigt f 246 r att sedan 246 verg 229 i en tydligare r 246 kig eftersmak 228 n den 12 229 riga men svagare 228 n 15 229 riga vinner p 229 ett par droppar vatten och 228 r den b 228 sta bowmore jag smakat  if i have to choose one this is it  i would compare this very close to the lagavulin 16 absolutely brilliant and beautifully balanced from whiff to end a good friend of mine and myself destroyed a bottle of this in 1 night it was amazing having begged quot perhaps closer to the floor quot for more  first islay i ever tasted and like i said not for me smells and taste like a sauna is what i compare this to  it has the good things i like of the heavier islay scotches and the things i like about the glens in one package i like the 12 year and this tastes kinda like it more smothiness through worth the extra money hm that 39 s up to you if you want something extra for a holiday and like the 12 year i recommend this for you  many of my recent peak life experiences have been celebrated with the bowmore 18 i 39 d have to say that it is my all time favorite alcoholic beverage try it as part of a quot whisky flight quot starting with bowmore 15 then the 18 and finally moving on to something dry like ardbeg corryvreckan the experience is very different compared to tasting each individually the flavors that develop will just blow you away  this is a beautiful whisky full ripe and round with orange marmalede and hints of smoke a long finish very well balanced those critical of this malt don 39 t know a fine whisky or just nicpicking  i like the fruit that come through finishing with a lovely smokey taste on the palate sp surprised that no one has reviewed the b18 in several months it was the first islay that i ever tried several years ago and is still my favorite though the lagavulin 16 and ardbeg uigeadail are mighty fine the balance with the b18 is simply incomparable maybe perfect though i 39 m still hoping to find that magical dram that stands head and shoulders above the rest i really enjoy reading the negative reviews for any whisky very entertaining hard to imagine that we are tasting the same whisky also the b17 is still offered in duty free shops in airports around the world not sure if it the same item as lamented below but it is great too  so steht es vermutlich um vorschriften in der eu zu erfuellen nur auf der flasche aber nicht auf der box wieviel steht allerdings nicht also likeur willi mueller i ve had a couple of bottles of the old bowmore 17 this new 18 replaces i like some peat but there has to be enough other things going on too that s what the bowmore 17 did brilliantly if you like a strongly peated malt you ll probably prefer the replacement over the 17ywill me however i m sad to see the old 17 go now to be clear this 18y is still a very very well balanced whisky but to me the 17 was sort of a benchmark there were very little drams that could match the price quality ratio of the old bottling time to look for a new benchmark some notes it s been 24 hours it s as i recall the notes i made on the nose the spirit is very gentle at first some lemon zest or rather orange zest quickly followed by the typical iodine peat not as much as i had anticipated though and vanilla something else rather refreshing and surprizing i found was pear take a sip and at first like half a second or so there s no hint of peat just a load of fruits pop into your head peach mango black current even some raspberry and at one point i thought i got some banana too these fruits are then overcast with smokey toffee and dark chocolate along with vanilla i wouldn t be surprized to learn that for this particular batch they cracked open a cask of age 20 after a couple of minutes comes the point i looked forwared to the most the old 17 had this really strong floral note some notes on line mention quot blossom quot others call it quot soapy quot to me it tastes of quot love in idleness quot viola violettes the flowers the dark chocolate aroma subsides a bit and becomes sweeter the mouth feel is silky smooth and warm but again here there s a really refreshing taste too lemon again other things i remember jotting down i may have scratched them out seconds later were black pepper white chocolate mouse oily egg yolk lots of sugar gt sticky sweetness ginger smoked meat bbqnow the initial question was time to look for a new bench mark sort of amoungst the island whiskies the bowmore 18 and the lagavulin 16 still reign supreme within their price brackets on the scottish mainland though the highland park 18 and the surprizingly charming the glenlivet nadurra and glenfarclass 105 are just too much where the bowmore 17 may have been less well balanced it had this distinct character that made it stand out and feel like a very special drink the bowmore 18 feels just too balanced it s like a buddhist monk you can t argue with them they re at peace balanced i d rather go into an argument with someone a little less perfect  reminds me of american bourbon not exactly a compliment as i don t like those oily floral notes of bourbons on the nose i found this is fairly peaty which surprised me since i detected little on the palate on the palate it s perfumy floral oily i struggle to rate this as i feel it s probably considered a pretty well made whisky but it isn t my passion i much prefer the bowmore 15 year quot darkest quot which has none of the bourbon feel and tastes more like an islay scotch whisky this tastes nothing like an islay scotch whisky  reminds me of a good american bourbon not exactly a compliment as i don t like those oily floral notes of bourbons on the nose i found this is fairly peaty since i detected little on the palate on the palate perfumy floral oily i struggle to rate this as i feel it s probably considered a pretty well made whisky but it isn t my passion i am a fan of the bowmore 15 year quot darkest quot which has none of the bourbon feel and tastes more like a islay scotch whisky  again those smoked apple juice notes toffee dull and thin on palate no more bowmore for me after 12 15 and 18 yo  this is a really nice dram personally i prefer other types of whisky to the islay malts but for an islay this is one of the best i have tasted thus far the alcohol is the first on the nose then comes the peat and smoke after this the taste is still peat and smoke but then the whisky becomes sweeter and quite fruity excellent for an islay  this is one of my favorite scotch from islay  many of our members are into the bowmore style this for the money is in our opinion the best the tasting notes are spot on 
1747.0, i was not expecting much from this one but the flavor is such a pleasant citrus sweet to a dry finish definitely a good casual whisky i ll be returning to  i say this not because i hate on it it is what it is no character and bland in a blind tasting vs cardhu 12 it falls short in richness of smell body of taste and lingering finish both were 39 easy drinking 39 sure but with the cardhu you can feel the character of the tipple the auchentoshan is just bland probably good for the base whisky of penicilin cocktail to me this is slightly below average the nose is abit harsh with some grassy note the taste is rather bland especially after about 30 minutes it goes completely tasteless and i had to pour down the sink you need to finish this whisky fast else it goes tasteless even within the bottle my last few dram of the bottle goes bad really fast to me i would not buy auchentoshan again  i really like this a few years ago i received a sample among a wide range of other single malts auchentoshen 12 stood out a mile fruity and spiced yet mild no harsh notes of smoke or tannins i ve been coming back to this as my staple ever since  started drinking scotch a few years ago tried many and have settled with auchentoshan unique and exquisite the only scotch i will ever drink  i am only starting on my whisky 39 journey 39 and after a fair bit of research picked a few bottles to start off with the first few were ok but still left me wondering if whisky was really for me then i tried this little stunner absolutely delicious smooth lots of flavour that you can actually taste and a finish that doesn 39 t burn your throat off highly recommend  very well made alc distillate nose sweet honeyed citruspalate vanilla orange aniseed finish medium dry light sherry nose some oak and leaf with hints of honeypalate sweet sherry notes of smokefinish dry and oakabsolutely not a bad one for that price but you can find better toffee and malt a hint of smoke but not unapproachable just sweet enough and doesn 39 t burn too much not sure why many on here hate on auchentoshan 12 but this is easy drinking enough to serve to buddies over for a small get together and when they want something more interesting you can break out other favourite bottles consider the auchentoshan 12 the appetizer to the main course and a good test to make sure you don 39 t waste your aberfeldy 21 39 s or lagavulin on someone who won 39 t appreciate  a good starter nice and clean before bringing out my favorites the dryness opens my taste buds and sets me up for a nice visit from my other scottish friends a little water goes a long way to bring out the sweetness  i think that all those who have given negative reviews here must remember one thing we all have different taste buds and preferences and you have to be a little careful with damning judgments as these can of course hurt those who really like this whiskey all talk about quot beginners quot is a bit pathetic there are very experienced whiskey drinkers who actually also like auchentoshan 12 years a little more professionalism is desirable i myself think that this whiskey is clearly affordable and good in the category it represents  good scotch very smooth easy drinking for anytime  delicate scotch doesn 39 t blast your nose out my wife loves it and it keeps her out of the glenfiddich 18  very mild but by no means bad shocked to read reviews that say quot bitter quot maybe they should stick to apple juice it 39 s a bit over priced i 39 d say  a good daily dram to be sure nose oranges some toffee and vanilla creamsicle anyone palette youthful more oranges and vanilla nuts and mild smoke dry medium length oaky finish good bang for your buck  i 39 m no pro as a scotch drinker but what i love about the good ones i drink glen morangie glenfiddish glen livet laphroige smokier than i prefer but it fits the comment etc is that they have a strong distinct take your breath away kind of taste i love that this one is bland very easy drinking but meh just not much to it oh well i 39 ll go back to the others and enjoy it all the more  unlike any other scotch i have tasted the nose is superb and it piques your curiosity the taste is extremely complex and after two fingers i 39 m still trying to decipher the range sweet and smooth it 39 s the panty dropper of scotch to be sure gonna save for special occasions  agree with earlier comments under quot bitterness quot i feel like i can taste the bourbon a bit too much it has a distinctive quot bite quot i had expected it to be smoother given the sherry cask finish also i 39 m generally not a fan of lowlands and this one did nothing to convince me to change my opinion  seemed to taste better and open up as i got a bit further into the bottle and i tasted a lot more of the fruit and vanilla flavours nice smoky finish  sweet pears fresh citrus taffy duck a l 39 orange hints of dark chocolate oak and leathery notes definitely a great dram for the cost  a beautiful scotch normally drink highlands this had a much smoother finish will be definitely purchase again  a light beginners drink overly light and bodyless with an unpleasant finish i have no idea what some of the other reviewers have been tasting  best at first the honey was so overwhelming to me that i wasn 39 t sure if i could get past it but after spending some time with this whisky i 39 ve come to really enjoy it the nose is honey vanilla brown sugar and oak it 39 s sweet as hell the palate is surprisingly smokey strong hint of oak and honey in the nostrils as you exhale it 39 s sweet bitter and salty as an ex smoker and coffee drinker the finish is tar smoke and oak and i love it it 39 s fairly reminiscent of a cigar in the mouth it 39 s a little bitter but after a glass of dull macallan amber my god i 39 ll take it at rougly 60 to 70 dollars canadian for a 750 ml it 39 s priced reasonably well for such a good tasting scotch  not the smoothest of 12yr old scotches but it is relatively complex and interesting just enough there to make you want to try it again it is a touch on the bitter side but for some that is just fine  there are a number of things going on here a little fruity yet it has some dry woodiness a touch of smokiness with a touch of sweetness a little bitterness yet some sourness only issue is that is has a bit of an artificial note in the background added colour all in all a good dram  i decided to taste this dram since i had some in the cupboard but my tasting notes picked up very different things it 39 s definitely fruity on the nose you also get a wiff of the bourbon on the palates i don 39 t pick up the sweetness but i get the zesty taste there is a slight bitterness as well on the finished it is definitely dry overall i loved the whisky and i would recommend it and buy it again i still had the old bottle so i am not sure if the tasting notes are different in the new released one  this is a great whiskey it is smooth enough to drink neat or with very little water it is complex and interesting enough to pitch it against many of the so called better whiskies on here this is one that i will definitely buy again i am now keen to try the triplewood  mediocre at best pretty much the same profile as speyburn 10 but at a higher price point my original concern was that the sherry cask would be over done as it turns out it was completely the opposite completely lacking in any sherry notes yea so pretty much just your below average run of the mill scotch  easy on the palate not harsh no burn on the way down and no bad after taste  lowland brilliancea great whisky so quaffable one could sip it all day everything a malt should be lightly smokey woody slightly sweet with a delicious aroma best under 21 years 15 is a good age 14 16 but 12 is okay young and lively perfect scotch  as the only triple distilled scotch left in the world this whiskey is my standard for all other more delicate than smokey it compromises well and opens up wonderfully with a couple drops of water  it is drinkable but not something i 39 d buy a bottle of  i had a dram of auchentoshan 12 at my brother 39 s irish pub this week i was quite impressed it had such a beautiful nose i thought that it was light sweet floral mellow and lovely i will return to this one  product description of mandarin toffee and honeysuckle is correct but they didn 39 t add that it was flat mandarin uninspiring toffee and plain honeysuckle not a bad dram by any means just a damn boring one auchen is like a friend that you would invite over only when other friends are around  that was my thought when i opened the bottle and poured when i read the product description of mandarin toffee and honeysuckle it seemed right very smooth and full bodied i sipped it with some dark chocolate and it was heaven wonderful value i have some unique tasting nuances and finances prohibit me from going well beyond this price point but i received this bottle as a christmas gift and i have to say that fruitiness of the dram and the sweet notes are well within my liking threshold simply stated i am a humble ex police officer and paramedic and the simple things in life enthrall me now and this whisky is certainly one i would not necessarily recommend to a whisky aficionado but for me very good choice  not as complex or refined as some of the more expensive single malt alternatives but provides a smooth balanced whiskey with notes or citrus and caramel unique value proposition at the price point  if you enjoy the blends chivas and jw and looking to enter into the good side single malts start with this my father has yet to like one single malt but i poured him a dram of this a couple of months ago and told him it was a new blend i found at the liquor store and he actually liked it after his second one i told him it was a single my cousin tried it too and thought i was giving him a taste of a very expensive scotch observations a bit cognac like slightly sweet in the front brian does a good job expressing it below very approachable i recommend keeping a bottle on the shelf don t drink with water or ice it gets rough i like it from my cold fridge  orange nose orange and vanilla up front grassy finish very approachable for a scotch newbie like myself brian legere nc usa bloody awful save this one for the lassies you wish to impress wouldn t gie this tae a campbell if he first footed to me but n ben 1 star cause its no a blend  ignore poor reviews this is the one  fruity green apple nose very lovely good taste too some heat with some spice a good dram that most overlook shame that these lowland whiskies are often avoided this one is delightful  very impressive entrance tasting analytics will like the way it announces itself the finsh was the longest by far of any scotch i ve tasted but unfortunately highly astringent yes most won t mind the finish  auchentosh 12 years is the best thing that come after the sliced bread moslino montshioa soweto south africa i buy a nice bottle of single malt at christmas for my friends coming into town each year i try to sample our way around all the regions of scotland i m sorry to say this years selection auchentoshan was the first time we ve been disappointed we all agreed it s a smooth scotch but my enjoyment of single malt is the complexity with distinct beginnings middles and long finishes in my tasting this scotch delivers a pleasing butterscotch flavor and then promptly quits at this price point the same as the others i buy i expected more  love the nose vanilla caramel and some citrusthe finish is smooth almost but not quite sweet with no peat and a just a little smoke tiny bit of bite at the end my new favorite whiskey prefer it neat i found ice robbed some of the flavors from this one this is a very mild single malt  if it was possible to drink an angel she would taste like this  it s my favorite 12 year scotch eminently drinkable in large quantities which makes it dangerous to have around the nose to me is smooth citrus palate is light butterscotch and the finish is dulcet while still coming through with a comfortable burn which is important in a scotch of this kind  wonderful aroma of coconut vanilla orange palate doesn t match light oak and sour but lots of breathing turns this to honey good if average  i ll give this a miss for the moment x me and my unborn of 7 months enjoyed this very much thanks  like many lowlanders has a delicate and refined feel a great one for those who like a less pungent malt or are just beginning to engage their curiosity representative of the house and indeed area style actually rather good as an aperitif nose light and bright with a cereal sweetness and hints of pineapple and passion fruit palate certainly continues the cereal sweetness prevalent barley tones developing dryness and a woody vanilla finish of surprising length simple dry and malty sweet  the nose has a ton of fruit it s almost hard to smell anything else i get a bit of carmel and toffee aswell but who can tell over the citrus the taste is exactly like the nose indicates lots of fruit not oily and no grit in the mouth very clean finishes with a nicer burn than expected and grows a bit more complex at the very end this scotch is just what i expected from a 12 year lowland this won t bowl you over if you like peat and it s not terribly strong it is smooth the triple distillation is easily noticed and it is clean this is fun dram not just for beginner it s merits can appreciated by experienced palates as well  ok as an american who has tasted just a few scotchs and quite a few bourbons i can say that since this is my first true single malt i was quite taken with auchentoshan 12 year old nice honey color beyond that since im no whiskey taster all i can say is that after today no more hillbilly swill for me i have drank chivas and crown royal and if you want a single malt that covers all the basics of taste and smell and color youve picked a great on in the achentoshan 12 year old i found my thrill cheers while not the most complex single malt it is still a quality drink light and sweet with a long finish it maintains a scottish character without an intense smoke a good place to start if you re new to scotch i personally feel that the alcohol comes out a little too strong and contrasts with it s flavors but others have said they find it very smooth  as good as it gets drank 6 bottles with others at a scottish wake we had the 27 year old and that is the 10 rating i have given it the only other i like better is from the isle of islay peat single malt then again they are different  i m not a jaded vet i prefer glenmorangie 10 macallan 10 amp 12 this is certainly in that wheelhouse very nice sip to my senses  if youre new to the world of single malts you will likely be very happy with this one not too complex and very easy on the pallet lacks the bite and aftertaste of many others but very enjoyable all the same  as a highlander in exile this is one of my favourites pretty dull this one but then not a fan of light and citrusy whisky  a nice smooth whisky  this one gives not much to write home about  the nose is very sweet with a load of caramel a whiff of nuts and a spoonful of honey i like it a lot the taste is sweet but not overly so just a tad of lemon but again loads of caramel and honey mark dermul a toshan man the finish is medium lenght sweet and dry i like it a lot  a nice dram with a great nose smooth and although not the most complex it is all the better considering the price great for those just getting into single malts  i have enjoyed auchentoshan s 12 year old single malt for a couple of years it is a refined sipping whiskey to be savoured most enjoyed neat or with ice what a decent well priced whiskey should taste like having a nip or two now cheers i found auchentoschan only recently but now i hardly buy anything else it is so smooth that you d imagine mostly women would target the bottle to find the label but all my guests have been doing that try it you won t be disappointed 
2113.0, ads a brit abroad i have always found glenkinchie the perfect balance to a day of hard work a drop of uische bahama and settle back in your chair a roaring fire and a pork steak potatoes in kackets a highland butter tea in pot simmering away turf fire boots for wellies off legs on stool cigar in mouth timber crackiling away more lumber to cut from the tree that fell some time back but that 39 s for another fine day too wet to bring the landrover up the forest but wait a knock on the window it 39 s my neighbour with some fleese for me come in come in friendly neighbour just opened a bottle of glenchie whisky 12 yr old let us both share of old times when glenchie was only 163 6 00 a bottle car road tax 163 2 50 a yearnew land rover 163 295 00yes jimmy indeed jimmy old friend here to your health friend and to yours also my dear neighbour  very nice indeed  in the beginning i was not able to fully enjoy this whisky until i finished first quarter of the bottle after that i finally found how delicate this whisky was smooth good for long evenings with friends  nose spring honey with fragrant spice palate dried spiced figs does so well until it goes off sherry at a bitter end after and it 39 s gone  was distinctly underwhelmed with the first dram but it 39 s just got better and better  easy drinker would be good for a whisky beginner i 39 d say really pleasant on the palate wow i m a dyed in the wool islay peat head and have just started venturing on a journey around scotland and ireland bought this for a taste with a loch lomond 18 and imo it is an easy points winner loved the fresh fruity aroma and the granny smith smell reminded me of my wife s shampoo i know strange but a lovely aroma was backed up by a lovely taste beautiful finish and a longing for more a very special dram those giving 1 star i don t really get whisky divides like nothing else but this isn t football to give such a low rating is silly imo a nice easy drink neat or watered the lovely fresh apple smell smooth tongue and warm finish beautiful i m 100 islay peat wood smoke but this is a lovely inoffensive sweet drink it 39 s ok just ok  sweet smooth and lite it 39 s so enjoyable my wife is joining me with a dram in the evening great value in my option and one to have when friends come round for dinner as this offering will suit most pallets  cannot drink without water way too strong with water it radically changes it comes alive with fruit apples caramel and a nice sweetness still strong and easy to drink a lot in one sitting a rich dram and not for beginners but worth a try  too many high ratings i got a dram as a sampler and it was disappointing compared to the other four why would you want a grassy whisky with extra burn i agree with another post for lowlands auchentoshan was delicious  refreshing and light to the palate i don 39 t have that great knowledge and vocabulary and sensitivity to detect all those fruits and smokes and lizards but this drink neat is pretty neat quite flavourful on its own but even a little water dilutes it too much unlike laphroaig or ardmore for 3 200 in chandigarh it is worth it my top slot is still occupied by ardmore legacy and laphroaig 10 though ra  disclaimer i 39 m usually an islay fan and have a pretty basic palate this is my first lowland let rest for 10min nose boom floral honey butterscotch and a bit of spicy nuttiness to it palate right off the get go you get huge honey flavour massive green apple finished grassy oakey you also get a bit of a nuttiness to it sweet nut like pecan the texture is quite nice and a bit oily so it sits on the tongue perfect something i personal usually attribute to quality whiskey i got almost no smoke whatsoever just a bit of oak but that may be because of me killing my palate with the smoke of islaygood easy drinker decent value would buy again but not my usual drinker that remains to be corry  good smooth drink the perfect nightcap much preferred to penderyn that i was given at the same time  slighty honey taste lightly peated with long apple finish i agree with others that is almost blended job have had better but good introduction to peated blends as doesn 39 t come on strong  i know that 39 s a bit pretentious apple orchards don 39 t have a taste apples do well this lovely malt to me has a beautiful fresh apple note yellow or red apple with a very subtle peat smoke that is sure to appeal even to those who think islay malts are bottled turpentine the peat is even less prominent than something like jw black label but unmistakably there try it without water and then perhaps a literal drop it 39 s so juicy not nippy at all doesn 39 t need much btw i am not saying that there 39 s no other notes like orange or apricot etc i am not great at singling them out usually i notice 1 or three so i focus on the most prominent also it 39 s not absolute not like there 39 s a set number of notes aka quot the correct answer quot and people try to feel those no it depends on your own palate and experience if you don 39 t know what toffee is you won 39 t perceive it but it might remind you of dulce de leche or something else from your background so my quot green apple quot might be your quot kiwi quot i know they say lowland malts are quot light quot this is the only one i 39 ve tried but from what i gather it 39 s not a triple distilled malt like auchentoshan which is an irish whiskey produced in scotland nothing wrong with that comparing it to unpeated highlands and speysiders i wouldn 39 t call it light at least not like the much maligned light beers it 39 s fresh but no less substance than glenmorangie glenlivet glenfiddich old pulteney perhaps on par with old pulteney in terms of interest it 39 s not syrupy like aberlour or macallan has its own pleasant character fwiw i rarely think of different malts as quot better quot or quot worse quot i only compare them to contrast their features there are very few i didn 39 t like singleton of glendullan 12 and i like them all the light bourbon cask malts like glenmo10 the syrupy sherry monsters and the peaty islay bruisers all depends on the mood weather and company sometimes i even taste bottom shelf blends and i 39 ve found a few that surprised me though single malt will always be my preference i recommend this malt on its own however it 39 s also a good way to see if you might enjoy peat tasting an islay bruiser like laphroaig ardbeg or lagavulin might scare you off or you might become an instant addict instead try this or glen moray peated or highland park the peat is very tame but enough to get you acclimated to it if you can afford it i would go in this order glenkinchie 12 gt glen moray peated gt highland park 12 gt lagavulin 16 gt ardbeg 10 gt laphroaig 10  che dire merita veramente tanto questo glenkinchie 12 anni da avere nella collezione fruttato miele molto morbido allo stesso tempo potente nel retrogusto un grande dram  nice and smooth better with a gitanes cigarette  i tasted this scotch but i find it has no smell and taste i have not picked honey and fruit i did not like it lovely sipper massive hit of orange zest jaffa cake worth a try for the price un dramm assolutamente elegante ottima combinazione di sapori al palato e al naso da gustare nel pi 249 relax possibile  a delightful malt smooth fragrant and gentle on the nose toffee apples on the palate and a short gentle finish a malt for all occasions and one i would recommend to people just getting into whisky a highlight delight nothing to write home about decent dram  nose pleasant floral strong heather slight lemon cake palate sweet medicinal very heathery grapefruit very herbal smooth enough for a young spirit a dry oak taste develops reminding me of being in a sauna breathing in the air with water nose is much the same a sherry flavour coming through much smoother oak grape lemon and medicinal very sweet heather but on a better note than neat when i first got this in 2013 i didn t like it the chemical heather taste wasn t to my liking but coming back to it this is a nice dram it s a patient mans dram it needs 15 minutes and water give it that and you ve got a beauty i would recommend sampling this one as the sweet medicinal heather might not be to your liking  many peoples reviews are heralding this as smooth and drinkable i have to disagree after tasting this i did get many light fruit notes with sweet oak creeping in however there was a fair amount of bite and burn from the spirit i can 39 t be sure but i feel like they may have rushed the distilling just a bit  nice complex i really was hoping to like it more though there 39 s something soapy tasting about it though i guess i 39 m back to auchentoshan for the complexities of the lowlands  i buy a bottle of this every spring it 39 s light honey character and floral notes are perfect after a long winter of islays and bourbon  i drink it its very good live 5 miles away from distillary its a nice drink not much harsh but not value for money it costs 77 in dubai duty free and i feel it 39 s quite overpriced for the quality  che dire un ottimo whisky si lascia gustare al meglior dei modi lascia una sensazione di fresco floreale anche se tutto pu 242 essere soggettivo a mio avviso questo glenkinchie 12 anni merita veramente di avere in casa  that 39 s what i drink this whisky is awful i absolutely despise this flavour its the first scotch i 39 ve had the pleasure of tasting and it 39 s a good place to start it opens up wonderfully with a little bit of ice would definitely buy again  smashin taste considering the strength its nice to the nose tastewise strong but mild honey is quite distinctive i drank at room temp on its own lovely  as smooth as the day is long a veritable delight a must have in my collection  i can understand why the reviews for this are mixed it took me half a bottle to decide if i liked it or not spread over a number of weeks it is mild but then it is a lowland whisky so that should be expected being a lowland novice i usually sample islay speyside or highland whisky i initially found this to be bland but i think i needed to learn how to enjoy a different style of whisky i had to learn to appreciate the light nutty barley grass and oak aroma and the oat honey and apple palate this whisky is quite good at what it is a good value delicate subtle whisky personally i prefer more intensity but this whisky and the lowland region doesn 39 t promise intensity so i ought to be fair in how i assess it  this is a very delicate whiskey this is my first bottle i 39 m actually savoring it though at the current price it may become my staple first call  great value whisky that hard to fault easy drinking and very moreish be warned  excellent fine whisky for connoisseurs many other more expensive whiskies don 39 t have the same structure and delicate palate this is really a great whisky for beginners and experienced drinkers of scotch obvious notes of honey and green tea lightly warming the palate it s beautifully balanced and nuanced not peaty at all but much unappreciated if you like this try springbank 10  as a passionate and frequent adventurer in the alcoholic arts i gave this scotch a little try while exploring the wonders offered by the beautiful city of edinburgh the only wonder of this scotch is why it is still on the shelf the vicious flavour could only be improved if a canada dry ginger ale company drowned the pub i was sitting in and honestly i would have welcomed the spicy watery grave  if it didn 39 t say single malt on the side could have thought it was a blended jobbie i like this offering and can really tell the difference compared to a balvenie or auchentoshan i would call this a quot classic quot single malt scotch i think we are really lucky to find this locally montreal quebec  easy to drink very smooth and sweet initial taste of honey and grass on the back gets little hint of smok with tobacco notes good for the price if you are looking for a easy drink or in a hot region where peated can be little hard to drink recommended so must try so this is the last of diageo 39 s classic malts of scotland range that i hadn 39 t tried so after some searching picked up a bottle today initial taste is lightly charred oak followed by honey and sweet grains with a nice floral fruity finish i am normally a peat head but i love how grassy this one tastes it 39 s like taking a stroll through a meadow i love it sort of reminiscent of dalwhinnie 15 but smoother and fruitier this was definitely worth the effort it took to obtain it the sugarbear a refreshing apple cheeked bottle of bliss hints of honey and a trickle of grape juice and plums nose of hay and oats burst of gold tipped greenery and a long finish of sweet ceylon dimbula tea  i can understand some people thinking this is bland it doesn 39 t have a massive character or a flavour profile you could hang your hat on but man this thing is smooooooooth just enough florals to keep it worthwhile and a touch of heat in the finish to remind you what you 39 re drinking a really great easy drinker  a m a z i n g  flat and floral perfume but round and smooth thin not full bodied at all an artificial finish compared to cragganmore 12 and dalwhinnie 15 this is a little bit boring but i think i 39 ll give it another try sooner or later not bad but not highly recommended  my favourite non peated whisky veritable delight for lovers of non heated single malt whisky  i have been searching for just this in my favorite scotch the neat nose is wonderful i interpret lemon zest pepper caramel and honey warm grains with a hint of smoke to drink i feel citrus oil tingling my lips a nice mild pepper burn faint peat faint oak sweet grain caramel marshmallows and a nutty smooth finish wow  very very tasty scotch that won 39 t break the bank my new favorite  i love it fruity and soft delicious  had my first dram in liverpool last night a great drink to end an evening light floral and sweet  i drink it very often i love this taste  this is such a smooth drink with a refreshing feeling left on your mouth after every sip simply a wonderful drink i would have rated 10 but my phone touchscreen is terrible happy drinking this is a light mellow whisky with notes of alfalfa honey sun dried tomatoes golden raisins and fresh hewn maple not quite nutmeg but a woody spice does not have the clover honey flavor of jura but a pleasant consistent honey note even at 43 does not require water to be enjoyed the flavors will appear with time in the glass  had this with a few cigars on my stag do got mixed reviews from some of my guests but an overall great drink especially with a cigar really bring out the flavours in the cigar  but not vacuous goes against the grain of single mslt classics in that it is not heavy peaty smoky but crisp mellow smmooth creamy n fruity n hint of aromatic spice at the same time  its the best for me smooth scotch really great  blows auchentoshan out of the water distinct lowland character you get the citrus tang it 39 s also got a maltiness about it that lowland barley there is also a sweetness about it 43 abv fills in the flavor profile well  this has to be one of the most enjoyable scotches out their thank you for the experience  i am new at the scotch world but am enthralled with the many aspects of this whiskey the color is wonderfully golden with an aroma to me as spiced fruit i did not pick up on the cereals the pallet was not as smooth as expected but generous with a full body of nutty fruit then there was a wonderful charred flavor that broke to a fruity finish i was duly impressed with this 12 year  this is my 100 perfect malt  color rich golden nose fruity some vegetal and herbal notes emerge with water palate rich texture fruity and honey notes finish fairly short clean with heather and barley a nice whisky this is much better than the old glenkinchie 10 y o of the past  i have received one bottle from my daughter last june i ve already bought others glen but never with this quality and taste i am sure that it will be very difficult to come back now thanks for the pleasure you give me  since being launched as an individual malt after being purely a blenders malt glenkinchie has got better and better a much more satisfying dram than its glasgow rival it has a naturally smooth velvet texture only found in the best single malts it can be hard to find but is well worth it  i was given a bottle as a gift and loved it it is now my firs choice single malt however a bit pricey for my pocketbook  a smooth gentle sort maybe not as exciting as others in the same price range but very comfortable this won t be my last bottle  bought a bottle of this a few months ago as it was on offer at a reasonable price wasn t expecting major things as the reviews i had seen were mixed but it has been highly enjoyable very smooth starts fruity and then honey for me almost has a creamy finish to it will definitely be making a repeat purchase  i had not had glenkinchie for over 10 years very smooth and easy to drink so in my house it won t last long strangely my edinburgh born father thinks it has an unpleasant aftertaste that i cannot detect at all still what does he know highly recommended  got a bottle in vegas airport with the last of my dollars to take home and its a lovey well balanced malt great taste and after taste would recommend it to any whiskey fan plus the bottles are generously sized which is always a bonus just love this single malt  amazing drink but way better with a drop of water makes its sooo smooth 71 in quebec a bit expensive nice nose good on the palette initially but let down by the tail there are better drams for the same dollars out there a classic malt what more can you say i drink it every week it does indeed come with a tasting glass the whisky s not half bad either the chaps at master of malt the picture would suggest so but there is no mention not that it s a deal breaker but it certainly would be persuasive if i choose to purchase this one shortly x bought a bottle because it was reduced i did not know what to expect it has a great taste and really nice flavor of malt willould buy another bottle again in the future  the edinburgh malt representative in style of a typical lowlander inoffensive and light enjoyable early afternoon or as a lunchtime digestive nose light tones of barley and nuts almonds maybe cashews honey oozes with a gently fruitiness palate fresh sappy and fruity honey and melon notes sing out with a hint of apple and oak finish not of great length but maintains that freshness and slight sappy sweetness with a touch of barley  best in its class for my tastes at least superb  what a revelation a fan of the big peat isla etc but this slaps you around the face and says what about me the pretty one who isn t in your face but sweet demure enjoy me for my clarity of soul and longevity of essence many thanks to t and z for introducing me to this  so easy to drink my wife loves it  just had a sample from master of malt enjoyed the light taste really smooth highly recommended  drink glenkinchie 12 year old at my local the stables in kirkintilloch it is first class  just picked up a bottle of this from local supermarket as it was on offer great sub 30 dram if like me you like them smooth and subtle 
2562.0, along with old pulteney 12 this has to be one of the worst 12 years olds on the market bland and completely uninspiring my new favourite whisky light fruity with a lovely finish thank you for the unexpected and free 50cl sample with my latest order nevertheless my review is my honest and unbiased opinion this 12yo single malt whisky at 40 alcohol is harsh on the palate lacking in subtlety and has no discernible complexity on a remarkably short finish i would recommend it as a cocktail mixer  this reminded me a lot of balvenie raisiny quite dry a little nutty i 39 m baffled by all the hate in the negative reviews there are some awful blends out there and some very underwhelming single malts but this is a far cry from either it might not be to your taste but it 39 s a solid whisky and very good value for 163 25 or less  at this price it rates very highly sweet and fruity notes lend to an exceptionaly smooth finish if you prefer peatier eathier single malts then this is not for you i personally wouldnt waste it with a mixer it 39 s a whisky you can drink more than you intended to very easily  i bought 200ml today i finished it but this is not a single malt you would be happy with some strange flavours going on but outside of that very basic single malt with low flavour contrast whiskybase rates it 74 avg don 39 t know what the youtuber 39 s feel about it but skip this  absolute shit burnt taste like drinking from a stream during a bushfire zero flavour just horrible i will give it away homeless will probably reject it very disappointed my regular is glendronach macallan metho and boot polish would be better  a little harsh for a 12yo the flavour is neither light nor rich it lacks identity but isn t the worst dram by any means a few drops of water helps to open it up when bought on offer sub 163 25 it represents good value for an entry level malt  this is a lovely whisky very good value for money i wouldn t call it an out and out speyside just nice everything has to be value for money not that the best i enjoy lagavulin ardbeg talisker arran longrow and this to many people put a price on what s good enjoy the fruity smell plus the sweetness and spices woody warn feel just blend with the smoothness of this whiskey lovin it for the price this 12 year old is a good value fruity hints of sherry banana and woody notes silky mouth feel with a medium finish definitely a nice compliment to my bar  a very good malt that s for sure was able to compare it with my 2 favourite mainland malts which also arrived this christmastime which i won t list i preferred it finding it smooth and just that little bit different to deserve its new position on top of my favourite list  excellent delicate malt and oak flavours and neither overpowering nor peaty ignore the boorish oafs with their 1 star reviews these are submitted by armchair whisky quot experts quot with a singular taste in whisky you know the type the ones that only rate quot punch you in the face quot peaty whiskies they complain it 39 s bland or lacking in flavour because they are inured to the flavour of peat if you like lagavulin you 39 re probably not going to like this if you don 39 t like lagavulin you probably will it 39 s as simple as that not all whisky should taste the same  so i ve been on the hunt for a budget scotch daily sipper i like my single malts above 43 preferably 46 and above but they re expensive in b c canada so i have narrowed it down between this one glenlevit 12 glenfiddich 12 aberfeldy 12 tomatin legacy and maybe monkey shoulder this one is 54 canadian so 2 more than tomatin and the monkey 11 cheaper then the glens this one is about as good as it gets for the category tastes almost identical to glenlevit 12 for 10 cheaper i think i found my new cheap daily dram i think it s a new bottling though label is teal blue not sure why all the negative reviews either  afortunadamente podemos obtenerlo en m 233 xico y es accesible su presentaci 243 n no es llamativa pero es diferente un vez que lees su etiqueta recibes la invitaci 243 n a desgustarlo  i am a single malt lover and generally enjoyed my lagavulin and laphroiag while i lived in the uk but these are not often on offer in calgary where i now live i saw this whisky on offer in a calgary liquor store for 32 99 so i thought i would give it a try while i was expecting to be a mild easy drinking single malt i was not expecting that it would be devoid of flavour there was no note and it tasted no different than a cheap blended whisky it might be ok if someone has never tasted a single malt and want to be introduced to it but even then i would takethem straight to a glenfiddich for this to do service to single malt all in all i would not recommend this whisky  like many others i didn t like this one at all it thin a bit harsh and absolutely uninteresting dram it resembles the cheap scotch blends a reminded me why i stoped drinking them here in canada it priced similarly to other entry level singles which are by any parameter better then this i wouldn t recommend it to any one there is nothing there for the experienced drinkers and the newbies won t find anything new or distinctive that would draw them into the wonderful world of single malts  hand sanitiser should be the vocation of this distillery i enjoy single malts for the character this has none no flavour no nose no personality it is inoffensive but pretty much pure alcohol in pure water i was given a bottle of this finally got around to opening it and for the first time in my life poured it down the drain there is no other use for it  no nose no palate no finish will use this as mixer it s not worth the price this shouldn t cost more than jw red label which is better than this  being scottish i m trying to get into malt whisky bought the singleton today as it was on offer at less than 163 18 in bulgaria with 2 glasses this is one of the most enjoyable malts i ve tried so smooth and easy to drink my favourite so far  new scotch drinker here not a scotch snob at all this one seems a very nice intro for me as it s smooth and malty scotch that doesn t seem too complex i m enjoying it quite a bit just straight with an ice cube us 60 at 7 eleven in bangkok tax on imported spirits and wine is outrageous here  love it smooth whisky i don 39 t need to pretend i can taste something complex reading some of the comments is like a roll call of pretentious whisky snobs i can imagine these bores forcing people into a coma telling you about all the imaginary flavours they can and can 39 t taste or smell at the end of the day it is a flavoured spirit  good for a highball pretty one dimensional whiskey  awesome was looking for something to numb the pain after my dog died the wife ran him over while leaving me i ll miss that dog but have now found a new best friend nose malty oaky sweet with fruity nuances like orange zest sugary caramel is obvious amazing density can be noted palate is in perfect correlation with the nose so oaky sweet fruity citrus nuances are dominant finish oaky fruity and long  not the best simple and not very complex not a patch on glenlivet only buy this if you get it under 163 30 not worth anything more  thin simple and one dimensional good price but this is a dram for entry level scotch drinkers  same price as jw black label or chivas regal 12yo the taste is distinct but a bit too straightforward a drop of water opens the flavor  same price as jw black label and chivas regal 12yo but anyway it 39 s a 12yo single malt and tastes better the flavor is distinct but a bit too straightforward a drop of water will open the flavor within the box comes a mould for ice ball so i tried with an ice ball you drink too much before knowing it  it s a good whiskey for the less experienced tasters the price value is more than acceptable  the unique bottle shape of the singleton of dufftown is inspired by a traditional hipflask while the colour of the glass reflects the blue flint glass used at the turn of the previous century we have an original copper hip flask from dufftown where we live which was used for acquiring whisky it is the shape of the bottle  if your going to introduce someone to scotch and they 39 re not use to drinking on the rocks or neat this is probably the one to start with it 39 s very drinkable completely lacking of any challenging flavours and still has some scotch flavour but beware if you have tried several quality brands of scotch you may find yourself wondering if someone watered down your drink when you weren t looking  1 my comment about the ugly bottle is not about appearances more about practicality the shape of the bottle makes it look huge and it 39 s not practical to store with other bottles maybe it makes it stand out at the bar but then the greenish glass is rather ugly just sort of unattractive mind you i bought the bottle to give the malt a chance despite the looks 2 confusion about provenance if you read up on singleton you 39 ll see that in the american market it offers quot singleton of glendullan quot 12 15 and 18 all at 40 abv in europe it 39 s quot singleton of dufftown quot and there 39 s also a different version in asia same ugly bottles and brand name quot singleton quot i think that 39 s confusing customers expect the distillery name to be the brand of a single malt 3 the malt itself is not vile you won 39 t pour it down the drain very drinkable somewhat sweet generally true to description on label with not much more interest or uniqueness quite heavy on e150a initial impression was rather quot meh quot gradually it grew on me relatively speaking why even use the ugly green glass if you 39 re using a colorant to lend a quot beautiful quot color or rather why use colorant if you use green glass of course that goes for many a distillery i did finish the bottle but for the price you can do much better with glenmorangie 10 glenfiddich 12 glenlivet 12 old pulteney 12 speyburn 10 no repeat purchase from me i might revisit if singleton comes up with a traditional bottle and offers natural color products at higher abv would love to really taste the distillery character thank you  it s a nice scotch it s fresh it s got some malty and some oaky notes sure but it s very light  very pleasant honey malt fruit nose typical of the highland region the palate is quite light and unremarkable finishes with peaches and a touch of vanilla for me price point is critical with this one unless it is cheaper no reason to chose this one over other entry level highland malts  pleasant soft and the quot kindest quot whisky ever tasted delicious and nice  maybe i got a bad batch looking at other reviews barely any character just a sharp undesirable taste like a cheap bottom shelf single malt the bottle design is quite stupid also as a full bottle falls over at the slightest nudge or table wobble  i have difficulty believing this is a single malt it has a rough edge but not islay rough more like a low end whisky sort of rough i like strong tastes like lagavulin 16 and laphroaig quarter cask but there had better be some smoothness to it i get that some people might be buying this one because the price is right but if you wanted something nicer in a comparable range i would prefer a nikka it 39 s not awful but i won 39 t waste time and money with this one again  one of the best i 39 ve tasted  es muy suave nada de turba whisky para tomar dia a dia el precio es muy bueno a mi esposa le encanta  my boyfriend cant love without it  nice whisky rather thick haven 39 t encountered that before thumbs up excellent drop smooth to be enjoyed slowly  i had read quite a few positive reviews for this scotch and i love the price point so i decided to give it a whirl maybe i 39 ve got a bottle from a bad batch but my first impression was that it was a bit thin uncomplicated and generally lacking that isn 39 t to say it is bad but it isn 39 t 39 good 39 simply 39 ok 39 it actually felt like a blend to me not a total loss this bottle will be relegated to a 39 house scotch 39 assigned to the lower shelf with the likes of grant 39 s family reserve and cutty sark prohibition both of which i prefer to this and offered to those less likely to know the difference  just nice doesn 39 t pretend  loving it in colombia great taste and very smooth best whisky ever tasted in terms of single malt whisky i would recommend every one who likes drinking whisky  a straight forward whisky which delivers as promised but no more i prefer an oban or the glenmorangie because theres a lot more depth in the taste and aftertaste  yes the tasting note by the chaps at master of malt is spot on when in come to nose and palate but i 39 m not agree when it comes to the finish the finish keeps oak yes but it 39 s not rich with good length the finish is most of all a sweet goodbye and welcome back from the toffee some fruits there that 39 s true it 39 s so smooth or should it be a little more punchy maybe it 39 s not meant to be the punchy whisky no it 39 s meant to be that smooth nutty toffee for it 39 s age for it 39 s price ok i liked it over the average level  i normally drink smoky whiskeys like laphroaig but this was a really nice single malt  haah raki i think that guy must have indulged in a bit too much honey bee grayanotoxin when he went to turkey very smooth and comparable to the accomplished glenlivet 12 in that price bracket it has a low profile turkish bulgarian raki quot nose quot and quot plate quot that has medium anise flavor its not naturally smoth or balanced its sharp and yeah naturally rich you might like your nose in side the glass but the quot plate quot orange zest spiciness cmon its just anise go drink raki in turkey u will enjoy it if you like this turks say quot raki balik quot try it this one just calls it in a cheaper way  outstanding i drink only jw black label or platinum label i bought one bottle of singleton when i was coming from usa now i wish i could buy few more cheers singleton rocks on the rocks  very smooth and easy to drink with a good smoke  insane the good grades this whisky gets on the web is it the cheap price is someone hiring peolple to leave comments i don 39 t know i don 39 t understand why glenfiddich gets so much heat for being to simple and little intense well singleton is even less intense mind it has a good taste profile no faults no moldy barrel no glue aftertaste no bitterness not excedengly sweet nicely fruite apples pears but there is just so little of anything here it 39 s the first time i honestly think of the concept quot watered down quot even so perfect beginners dram but for people looking for something more well it falls short  it is a good dram but the heat that came out of the dufftown bottle leads me to believe it is bottled at a little higher volume than 40 i be back for more  we bought a bottle on the way back from the the far north west of scotland it has lasted for only six weeks i wish we had purchased more  first impression when opened the bottle i almost got dissapointed it reminded me of a blend i am not that fond of but second impression and when i tasted it i was so positive impressed by the malty barley sweetness and the thickness in this whisky something i have been looking for for a while in whiskies goes very well alongside a good cup of coffee  first impression when opened the bottle i was almost dissapointed thought i had bought something like famous grouse a blend i personally do not find attractive but in comparison this malt is way over fg i think the malty barley sweetness is so much to like something i have long looked for in whiskies a drop of water open this malt up it goes so very well alongside a good cup of coffee anytime a day i will be happy to present it for friends family and hear there opinion on this on i surely see why the supermarked almost have not enough bottles of this one  this is a wonderful scotch rich and smooth with lovely texture the taste and more so the after taste leaves you wanting for more since not many people have tried it yet its fun to introduce it to them enjoyed my last with a cohiba on a cold saturday evening  when i die i want to be embalmed with this whiskey in fact just let me have my final rest in one of the cask 39 s this is the best i ever had  i cautiously purchased two bottles when i tasted i realized i should have bought more than two this drinks so easily just slips down the throat like honey a bottle doesn 39 t last long especially if you 39 ve a friend who likes single malts too  excellent smooth tasting with a multitude of flavours and tastes i 39 m an old malt quot hand quot but it is an very good whiskey for new fans  very smooth lovely balanced indeed got it as a present from my colleagues all i can say is that i should have tried it years ago absolutely recommend it give it a try you won 39 t be disappointed  opened it up on christmas and enjoyed a finger smooth and delicious without any oily or petrol notes  nice smooth whisky with a toasted dried fruit background i get sultanas citrus peel fig nice gentle wood nose nice finish actually a great whisky at this price point i highly recommend this would be a good starter single malt i need to add a footnote here i didn 39 t buy this for a long time because of jim murrays tasting notes then my local supermarket in ireland had a sale and this was about 40 bottle so i said i 39 d have a go i normally agree with jim but he is way way off base on this one this is a nice whisky  this is one great single malt great full and slightly spicy nose that completely prepares you for the taste which is also great orange toffee spice oak a whisper of smoke and as smooth a 12 year old as i 39 ve tasted zero throat burn just that warm tingle that reminds you that you 39 re drinking alcohol not the best i 39 ve tasted but extremely good and absolute best value for money as i 39 ve seen thus far in my area it is 22 00 cad cheaper than dalmore 12 which is perhaps most similar in taste and quality as i 39 ve experienced great job dufftown  smooth  i mostly like peaty whiskies ardbeg probably most of all but sometimes want a contrast and i think the singleton is my favourite standby contrast it is also available very cheap if you are in a supermarket in france roughly 163 20  a very smooth malt with enough taste very nice to drink very interesting specimen of whiskey but very very underrated in europe great representative of speyside  nice whisky excellent tasten nice to drink love it  i enjoy this but i would not put it ahead of the glenlivet i find more interest in the glenlivet taste however this is a malt not to be missed and it may be more to your taste i would fully recomend it  i can t think of a whisky that is as carefully balanced as this one it s not too vague but also not too pronounced it manages to keep you in the sweet spot it never bores never disappoints never offends by far the best bang for your buck whisky out there  i am a regular glenlevit drinker and one day last week i walked into a liquor store and saw bottle i was instantly attracted to it and took it home for cheaper than the glen i went back again to get the bottle but it was sold out and out of distribution very sad for me my girlfriend who is a non scotch drinker loved it and is also going around town helping me find a bottle if anyone has an idea where i d find it in houston tx please post dear reader today on my 56 anniversary i had the pleasure to taste for the very first time your 12 year old singleton i can tell you that i am overwelmd by the smooth and delicious taste of your single malt scotch  just bought this at a great price in cape town on special at makro the equivalent of cosco here settled down just now with my first sip lovely nose the european cask aging comes through with a lovely deep woody sweet whiff on the palate i thought this was really smooth with a complex character that has to be appreciated i will definitely share this with guests very selfishly  as a newcomer it s easy to love this scotch soft fresh delicious  spotted this attractively packaged and priced little number whilst holidaying in samoens france instantly whisk y ed to the side of a wide speyside river old cane trout rod in hand casting across with a bloody red butcher like a searing steely rivet fresh hued into the side of my mouth it burns soaring high as a golden eagle across glenfeshie reaching peaks of rough hewn granite where crystal clear water starts its journey to the sea below time for a other dram wee laddie to be continued  this whisky is very smooth and easy to drink i went through the bottle much faster than expected  this one is a good but rather traditional speyside not a challenge ut still nice as evening drink first of all the bottle is beautiful very smart packaging i actually think some people want to like it because of the good looks on the nose it doesn t bring a lot some sweetness some barley than the taste is just that not smooth i don t get why people call this smooth and so easy there is a hint of orange that appeals but then afterwards you get a sharp edge that just ruins it not that i hate sharpness because it can be functional in a certain dram but this is just a cheap kind of sharp one of the most dissapointing buys in a while if you like easy going you can find a lot better in the same price category for example a glengrant 10y or a balvenie doublewood 12y  i love this mild single malt with just enough flavor my friends who used to only drink blends now also like this so i am getting them to trade up  good stuff mellow accessible not to complex but good starter stuff and enough for you to keep coming back for managed to pick up in booker with two glasses 24 which can t be bad  i ve had this one before and remember it being very smooth with a rich nutty malty sweetness i have just picked one up from tesco for 163 22 real bargain and can t wait to open it and see if it is as good as i remember  absolutely first class nuff said this was bought as a leaving gift from my work mates to take the time and effort to get this a gift for me was truly humbling i ll treasure this i only tried my first single malt on a jaunt in the cairngorms in the summer i was so takentthat i couldn t wait to buy a bottle for my friends to do me this honour is wonderful  this one my dad andrew bought for me was included as 1 of 4 little bottles in a whisky set i chose one at random and sat down to drink never really drank much whiskey but this has opened the door for me to try more singleton melts when it hits your lips then spreads and smothers more of your taste buds sweet and a little spicy really great taste i do want more thats why i ended up here after searching for singleton 8 10 my journey into the vast tastes has really only just begun so i m leaving room for improvement p my favourite whisky very easy to drink almost too easy  i love this whiskey veeery smooth perfect served neat  world whiskies awards 2012 singleton of dufftown 12yo wins best speyside 12 years and under i like this malt  if your like me and really enjoy your malts but cannot afford the really aged stuff then this is for you highly recommended a very drinkable whisky smooth and flavoursome  deserves more than jim murray s 71 i d rate it a nice round 80 if you see it on offer snap it up  i m at chatsworth country fair and stumpled across a stall doing free samples the staff was all smart dressed with the latest gadgets but could only tell me the whisky was from dufftown in the speyside area well i must say apart from there lack of knowledge it was a really nice drop of gods water  i had the same nice experience with this whisky i ve never tried a whisky so easy to drink and flavored definitely i d recommend it for starters  my wife and i bought a sampler pack which included a 5cl bottle of this we got it just to try out for a one off new experience sort of thing but we were seduced by this pleasant drinking winter warmer i would recommend this for those starting out on the malt adventure its well rounded tasty and nice finish the other malts in the sampler were strong with odd aftertastes to us but we ll be returning to this one 
1969.0, got this as a xmas gift finished on hogmanay lol love the hint of vanilla  has a strong nutmeg taste i didn 39 t like this scotch everyone has a unique palate but not for me  the colour was most encouraging but the taste was not quite as intense  lovely drink got a bottle fer xmas wow what a surprise is so easy drinking lol so smooth after one you just wanna go back lol really good malt to introduce noobs to  this is a very unique scotch no doubt there was an offputting aroma to this scotch best described in between an indescribable nut and a the smell of freshly polished wood it is very different than expected and reminds me of a darker more stronger flavor of almonds with a hint of sulpher that best describes the flavor i am capturing certainly not a scotch for everyone but i can see why it is beloved amongst so many who adore such flavors  it s the equivalent of drinking a mcewan s treacle toffee hold it on your tongue and the depth of flavours reveal themselves in a scintillating symphony this dark seductress is thankfully very underpaid  this is a fantastic malt never lasts for long had the pleasure of visiting the distillery twice in the 80s as a coach driver amp was well looked after  doing tell anyone how good this stuff is otherwise it will increase in price or it will become as rare as rocking horse shit wonderful i recently drank the last of my edradour 10 distellery edition whisky smooth delicious and heartwarming a drink to saour certainly helped me get through the last and current lockdown with mental and physical health intact  delicious bottle did not last long hence looking for you on line fortunate enough to have visited distillery keep safe  smooth and long on the palate neat on the pasture lands of central texas at sunset cannot be beat  this is completely unique to anything i 39 ve tasted before needs a chance to breath but lovely deep and rich flavours fruit cake and caramel notes dark and delicious this tastes more like a 15 year old  stunning smooth as a silk codpiece this is the first edradour i 39 ve tried i love a fine malt whisky absolutely excellent it was recommeneded by a whisky shop in kelso scotland he really knew his whiskeys will try others well done  i have only had one small bottle of edradour in 2004 the taste was spicy strong wonderful i can tell you nothing about the nose because my sense of smell isn 39 t fully working but my sense of taste told me the whiskey was a find and i love it i plan on getting a bottle soon  this whiskey simply defies it 39 s age it is smoother and more mellow than many twice it 39 s age one for the permanent collection  creamy spicy dried fruits a bit of medium sherry lol yes just a bit fabulous stuff this for the money i hesitate to review this as it will become harder to find struth only whisky i drink now nothing else comes close imo  good on the nose but the taste leaves a lot to wish for some dark choclate but also a strange and unpleasent taste of sour red wine not very well done and unbalanced e while sitting in the garden in the sun and sipping this beautiful golden colored scotch it was like heaven i hope to do this again ciao my next bottle of scotch i buy will be edradour aged 10 years ciao when scottish poet stuart patterson visited grahamstown south africa i shared a bottle amongst friends liquid poetry had to close up the bottle with just a little left to save for my son stuart promised to write a poem called a tot for ma boy unforgettable even unforgettable whisky  mmmmm but mabey not for nutmeg lovers dried fruit on the nose a little bit of water really helps it open up delivery is a little dry then sweetness kicks in at mid palate finish is medium length and clean nice complexity for a fairly young malt well done  delicious whisky for those who find it soapy does cilantro taste soapy to you could be your genetics for certain aldehyde smell receptors the change this whisky undergoes after sitting for a bit tells me it 39 s full of volatile aldehydes  my go to best has been for 20 years keep up the good work lads  i actually liked the interesting taste of this whiskey there were some tastes in this 10 year old i couldn 39 t place and couldn 39 t care i just liked it i then went and bought the slightly more expensive 12 year edradour caledonia looking for a still nicer whiskey a mistake i was real disappointed with that too smokey and too little sherry tones this 10 year was far more pleasing to my palate  sheer luxury the finish is fabulous my personal favourite  just tried this again two years after opening the bottle immaculate no gas no decanting straight up looong oxidation and this baby s singing if i review this bottle again as is i ll add two points at least for shelf life and its chrysalis like ability when opened and shelved buy on spot  had a bottle of bottlers 39 signatory edradour hooked the smallest working distillery in scotland handcrafted the gourmet single estate small batch quality is on par with any single malt or cognac at 10x its price  this is a whisky i have never seen here in the states but when i went to scotland i tried it and really enjoyed it and my local shop here in cali just happened to get it so i had to grab a bottle in scotland this was bottled at 40 but this bottle is 43 it seems darker than i remember it being with way more sherry influence very sweet and sherried some vanilla and maybe coconut which does give it a rum like character pretty smooth not soapy at all and natural color i think i overpaid for it at 75 but it 39 s worth it once if it was cheaper i would buy again the sugarbear if you make your way to the highlands you must visit pitlochry to tour the edradour distillery there is no better way to really know a whisky than to see and smell it being made and taste it with the maker  been drinking this for 20 years have tried so many others even at twice the price doesn t touch the rich smoothness is edradour  mhmhmhmh ottimo assaporarlo lentamente dopo averlo lasciato riposare nel bicchiere melodia di sapori ottimo  my go to favorite day in and day out has uniqueness and quality that outshines most 12 and 15 yr competitors  let it sit for a bit after pouring and add a drop or two of water but no more than that  very good to start let it sit to breathe when it opens up it is pure delight this made a whisky drinker out of me  i visited the distillery last years after the edinburgh festival in august fell in love with the area and the 10 year single malt i can 39 t believe this is a ten year old truly sumptuous sherry into chocolate with a spicy finish needs a half hour in the glass and a drop of water  when visiting scotland i was introduced to this scotch in edinburgh very complex flavor for a 10yr with a great after taste it 39 s hard to find bold flavors from scotch without a bitter after taste this is smooth earthy with hints of vanilla and a great after taste my father and i enjoyed drinking this on our train ride from glasgow to fort william while enjoying scenic views of the highlands would definitely buy again and have already it 39 s not soapy at all stop watering down your whiskey and enjoy the complex flavors of this well priced scotch  really intresting whisky with toffifee sherry dried fruit and a little sweet on the nose medium body with sherry sweet sour taste of fruit banana spice and rum  bought from the village at the bottom of the hill from the distillery sweetness on the nose left in the glass for a while with a dash of water opens it up no end increases the sweetness and the fruits  this whisky is an excellent value a nice light taste at a good price several reviewers have faulted the taste but can 39 t imagine they were referring to the same product i 39 m drinking i see no issue with the flavor or quality of this whisky i recommend it  fruity sweet fresh biscuit unique i love it  this tastes like play doh definitely unusual stuff  i got this as a gift and what a wonderful surprise fruity to the nose with vanilla and spice on the palette a clean finish delightful i 39 ll continue to buy this single malt and asher with my friends stands up nicely to my favorite cigar  this is a souls value and very drinkable i bought this on a whim for my friend as a christmas gift four of us tasted it 2 scotch drinkers and 2 non scotch drinkers we all found it to be very drinkable later we went to this forum and read the reviews we did not understand the bad reviews especially the ones describing it as quot soapy quot to each his own it 39 s always a matter of personal taste i will be buying a bottle for myself  amazing  properly sipped a delightful whisky for relaxing before a warm hearth  drinkable but it feels wrong it just taste weird is not bad in the regular sense but it just feels wrong  found this particular delight at the bath tasting rooms on the advice of the barman i tried it bought a bottle and have done so several times since i love it  this scotch has character i liken it to the macallan 12 year sherry oak very sweet very sherry forward as to the gents who commented on a 39 soap 39 taste that sounds like bollocks to me this is a high quality dram and you 39 ll love it if you 39 re a fan of the sherry genre or as one bloke mentioned below a nice change of pace if youre a peat fan 5 stars from david in nashville tn usa  this is a very nice whisky smooth fruity very drinkable as for those reviewers who say this tastes like soap please post exactly which soap you are using i believe i 39 ll try it  went over to spec 39 s in montgomery and was recommended but its quite awful so many better scotch 39 s to choose from  had this in a bar and loved it bought a bottle at a liquor store on the way home i might as well have bought a bar of soap because that 39 s what i got instead it was in a 55 bottle  i 39 m a drinker not a writer however wow a wonderful sweet fruity nose not so flowery as to deny it 39 s scotch heritage robust delightful smooth palate you 39 re right quot seductive almost coy for a single malt quot this is a great malt to serve to a non single malt drinking good friend being 70yrs young myself i like to think age is important quot wrong quot 10yrs and wonderful robert in canada  smells delicious but once you drink the stuff it gives way to an overpowering taste of soap is that normal here or have i got a bad batch  the best i have found for sipping straight  i suppose to each their own on this one i imagine good friends and a memorable distillery tour can make this seem worthy of top marks and preserving a particular personal experience but something doesn 39 t add up when standing on its own it took a very long time to open up with a neat pour eventually i got the sherried and vanilla nose but the syrupy palate is soapy confusing and a little too hot for being just 40 the finish while reminiscent of spice and custard unfortunately trailed into a thick numbing cough syrupy aftertaste if you 39 re into highland whisky i 39 d recommend looking at tasting notes for dalmore old pulteney or clynelish in the same price range  i am staying in centre of the great karroo semi desert with very little water after a hard days work on my farm in temperatures rising to 45 degrees centigrade nothing beats this whiskey as a sundowner got a bottle from my daughter residing in ireland great stuff  considering that my go to scotch is lagavulin 16 yr this made for a nice change of pace i am getting to like it very much i was quite surprised to find it here in montana to be sure but i am glad of it nice very nice  i got one in a prize and i thought it was a beautiful dram but i cant find it in any shops this whisky is truly disgusting i can 39 t understand the good reviews it tastes of chemicals and like a bar of soap what a disappointment after reading all the positive reviews 163 35 wasted  for the money this is a cracking dram i have a large selection of malts including some 3 digit bottles and this is a bottle i buy again and again was not familiar with edradour but it was in costco maui of all places and took a flyer lighter overall on the palate but makes up for it in lovely nose all the way to finish very pleasant dram not enough depth for 5 stars and would be 3 but overall complexity enjoyment push to 4  very good whisky this one 39 s a keeper  can i buy edradour 15year old plus 2glasses  wonderful clean and pure single malt highly recommended just to say what fantastic customer service i have received from master of malt 10 10 ajk best daily wee dram strictly for medicinal purposes found to date for the price point good stuff  a terrific whiskey a sweetness that doesn t over power the overall taste highly enjoyable  who poured me a glass and told me quot their 10 drinks like some other companies 18 i made that bottle last as long as i could amazing stuff particularly for the price  superb what more can i say it s just superb love this whisky dark dried fruits providing a deep mature sweetness hints of tobacco and licorice in the finish pretty complex for a 10 years old the guys at edradour are doing it right definitely a keeper  this a truly stunning single malt extremely smooth but still packed full flavour the tasting notes are spot on not your classic single malt but still a very very pleasurable experience  back in the year 2000 i was driving through scotland w some friends on our way up to inverness if i remember right we passed a sign for this distillery on a whim we pulled off the road and were acquainted with a real treat i brought back a bottle home to the states and have warm memories of that day  really enjoyed our visit to the distillery the guide was brilliant one of the best single malts we have tasted  lover of highland scotch for more then 20 years have enjoyed other 10yr 12yr and 18yr highlands i was given a bottle as a gift and although there are smoother 10yr single malts out there edradour 10yr has just the right amount of bite to let you know you are drinking a scotch with quality don t know if the 10yr are from sherry cask but the color seems to shows it may be i am one who enjoys the sherry cask quality the warmness that flows into your chest after allows you to know that even at only 10 yrs the quality that must come from older cask can only be that much better looking forward to trying older vintages  i m really enjoying this complex whisky easy to drink and fabulous on the nose but still with so much complexity distinctive and recognisable as soon as the glass comes up to the nose tasting notes above are pretty accurate yummy  the entry level for the distillery which is a truly magical place and a really brilliant example of what traditional methods and a sustainable business approach can achieve persnally i find the 12 to be more representative of the house style and slightly more complex this 10 year old however is still a really enjoyable traditional highland malt nose powerful fruitiness prunes dates figs sherry present but not dominant nicely balanced with notes of toasted oak and that enticing trail of vanilla palate very rich and creamy hint of nuts and heavily sherried fruit coming through sweet cereal and toasted oak flavours also apparent with a good deal of honey and a subtle touch of vanilla finish long for a ten year old and enjoyably warming the spice and fruit flavours linger while a trail of heather honey weaves its way in great old fashioned stuff  a great malt very different but i love it  tell me if i m wrong but it seems that most of the other distilleries these days are cashing in on the gotta have more peat craze to the point that that is all they taste like peat peat and more peat so it s so refreshing to have a malt like edradour 10 that is just being itself and how lovely that is  having worked in edradour distillery for 5 years lived in the little cottage over the burn ashbrook quot now a shop quot i know the time and care that goes into making a truely delicious wee dram enjoyed world wide  toured the distillery recently after being given a taste by my son outstanding probably the best whiskey i have tasted brought a couple of bottles home nearly knocked them off so have ordered some more rob saunders always a great experience with every glass but very hard to find one  a fantastic distillery to visit very friendly guide bought a bottle at the distillery and a few since scrumptious full fruity sherry taste perfect after a long walk on the beach in mid winter  the inlaws have visited the distillery twice and each time brought me back a bottle can t wait til they go again  i like this malt very much  simply wonderful the distillery is very nice bought a nice 10year old very complex flavour reminds me of my mums christmas cake heaven  i visited the distillery many years ago after trying this whisky its been my favourite ever since  undoubtedly the best malt ive ever tried even visited the distillery and bought a lovely bottle for myself ferr ower young or maybe bens horse wis jist a bit tae near the bottle line it needs at least anither 25 yrs tae mature  a small destillery but a big malt i was recently introduced to this little beauty friends brought a bottle for me i live in australia wonderful highland water thank you

this is an outstandingly sophisticated tasting scotch changes over time offering something new with every glass i 39 ve gotten flavors of honey hay cola barn yard grassiness funky dry aged steak cheese industrial oil burning wet leaves moss coastal air and more a really special whisky  very unique complex and old world quality malt don 39 t be fooled by the bottom shelf looking label this is an outstandingly sophisticated tasting scotch changes over time offering something new with every glass i 39 ve gotten flavors of honey hay cola barn yard grassiness funky dry aged steak cheese industrial oil burning wet leaves moss coastal air and more a really special whisky  october 2020 bottling is the fruitiest 10 i have ever tasted peaches and watermelon along with malt some smoke and earthiness classic springbank dialled up a notch simply a must have  just bought a bottle i was looking for that smokey peaty flavour that i remember of oban when i was walking and exploring across scotland i must say this whisky as an alternative to oban fxxxing brilliant enjoy in front of a winters fire when the weather is blasting the roof tiles  excellence at a great price have been wanting to try another springbank upon returning to australia since first trying both the 10yr and 15yr in scotand on a recent trip in my humble opinion i don 39 t think i 39 ve tasted a more complex mouth watering single malt than my current bottle of springbank 10 it delivers a new flavour surprise every dram superb  this whisky stay year after year one of my favorites it has something special unique something complicated that makes every sip a new experiance it is acutally quiet hard to explain it has multiple layers and delicate notes of caramel tobaco leather vanilla for a bit and has some sharpness at some point before becoming oily and sweet had 3 bottles of this one and i still discover new aroma every time i have a glass  i am getting into campbeltown whiskies this is a good example slightly higher quality than the excellent kilkerran 12 i would say this is reasonably complex and very pleasant the light peat works for me  a very good whisky tasty and fruity little smoke highly recommended  nose butter rubber earth brown sugar and smoke palate spice cream and fresh cut fuji apples forest vegetation and rind bitternessfinish starts with bitterness bacon olives and raisins great dram on the nose and palate but the opening bitterness of the finish can be off putting  when you get bored with yet another bottle of ardbeg 10 try this one similar in style but a little less peat the sky high quality is all the same e at the price point it is a complete no brainer this whisky is complex and interesting and has wonderful depth and character for it 39 s age it is a wonderful thing but irrespective of it 39 s age it is still wonderful i 39 ve had 21 year old whiskies that haven 39 t had half what this has this is my first ever springbank and i have to say i am delighted with it can 39 t wait to get my hands on more when the chance arises you should buy this is you have the chance absolutely no doubt about it to the reviewer saying there are springbank fakes 0n the market i don 39 t doubt that there is but it doesn 39 t make sense from the perspective of criminal enterprise to go to all the trouble of faking the cheapest of all springbanks if you can fake it surely you 39 d choose a higher end bottle in order to maximize your efforts  i always check the bottling information and springbank print the batch number near the bottom of the bottle i saw an older bottling on the market and the batch number is 10y o sringbank 15 40 note that i the p was missing from the springbank and there was no date too i am afraid that more fake bottles are on the market now pay attention  it s always nice to try a whiskey you have never tasted and this was a really nice surprise  great nose complex and interesting unique compared to what i have tried before palate was less exciting however still a delicious whisky thick creamy mouth feel all in all an all round good sipper which doesnt need any special occasion to enjoy  wonderful flavoursome whisky a real treat for a more experienced palate i would recommend to anyone who s looking to explore away from the usual suspects regions  harsh finish to start with 46 not chill filtered natural colour the bottle gets better as it gets down leather wet dogs peat seaside nutmeg iodine sherry and i think fizzy cider on the finish sometimes but honestly all things to all men ace whisky from a great distillery working mans whisky the real stuff  paid 66 99 usd for a bottle 71 99 with tax in 2019 this is an interesting malt let s start with the good this has to be much older than 10 years honestly it feels and tastes more like an 18 year albeit not a very settled one it does coat the mouth and drink like an old dram i love that this distillery does things the old ways and that they are a small independent operation this malt keeps on changing as you drink it and is quiet mysterious as it keeps on morphing into different flavors with every visit it does need a good bit of water to take out the heat and it does seem stronger than 46 percent however it is so hard to pinpoint the flavors of this malt as it is very elusive and is hard to pin down the not so good this malt confuses the palate and keeps changing its form there are so many flavors going on that they start to contradict one another lots of mismatched fruits sweet sour bitter earth peat smoke lambs wool hay medicinal band aids doctors office lemon lime cola almond salt oak rum tequila old leather attic dust musty stone cellar spring flowers ginger chamomile tea brown sugar etc while some of these flavors are so good and intriguing it is just so hard to pin point what exactly is going on here as all of those flavors are crashing against one another all in all it s down to the individual bottle and the individual if this malt can be tamed and a balance can be struck to find its sweet spot with some help of time air and water i believe this is a special malt with a self identity crisis perhaps pairing this with a desert or after dinner might help steer the palate in a specific direction it does keep me coming back to it so as to figure out what i will taste and smell next glass i think maybe if this was a few years older it may have matured into one personality or at least a few rather than so many great quality malt for sure just a bit of a schizophrenic as far as flavors go  for its price and age this whisky is well above average complex full of body and rich i ve not tasted whiskies with more than 16 yrs but if age is a statement it definitely not applies to this one for a beginner as myself encountering this dram was a happy accident  just amazing for double the price of a high street blended scotch obliterates more expensive whiskys that cost 3 5 times the price huge citrus peel pith going on antique sideboards smoke great tongue sting the finish is pretty much anything you can dream up as is the nose thai curry lemongrass bbq brisket fresh wood shavings mint honey star anise cinammon christmas pudding dry fruits not even funny how good this stuff is made a jerk chicken and chucked a dram over it and good god what a result buy now and splash it on all over  oh campbelton loch i wish you were whisky i would drink you dry quintessential scotch whisky addictive slightly smokey warming tasty lifts your spirit and makes you smile liquid opium  don 39 t normally do reviews but this is exceptional for a ten year old on the nose oak fruit and spice in perfect balance with a hint of campbeltown salinity rich sweet oily palate again some salinity quite a lot the finish is long and spicy with a smokey tail what 39 s not to like at this price i don 39 t think you could do better for the money  this scotch has it all depth great taste higher abv ncf and no e150 it has so many great flavors combining together to make one of the best scotches under 100 dollars  every sip makes you wanna say out loud quot delicious quot  quite fresh oaky bit spakling bity with a sweet smoke earthy n bold rich n creamy fruity with quite sweet caramel salty vanilla like finish  the springbank team use traditional production methods and are involved in every step of the whisky making process matured in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks this is perfectly balanced from the first sip through to the full rich finish orchard fruit with a hint of peat vanilla and malt on the nose the palate then opens to oak spice nutmeg and cinnamon and vanilla essence a fantastic sweet and salty finish makes this a favorite  for its modest price and age there is simply nothing that can match springbank 10 i find it amazing to read reviews that decry the lack of complexity and it being harsh many whiskies 20 years or older struggle to match the depth and character of this humble dram this latest bottle has a peachy stone fruit nose intertwined with a whisp of sticking plaster and salty burnt wood massive rich and spicy mouthful piney fragrant but reveals so much add some water and it moves to another level long creamy and smokey finish for 40 quid it s a no brainier but it won t last long because very little at this price comes close maybe an ardbeg ten is close but the springbank adds another dimension do not buy if you have a shallow obsession with middle of the road brand whiskies  considering the age and the pice range it is quiet amazing stuff very very well balanced with the costal peat the fruits the switness and this pleasant and long aftertaste far better than ardbeg 10 yo and even better than the laphroaig 10 yo i guess which is one of my favorite compare to this gentle peated whisky like bowmore taste like water i mean not really but you get the idea excellent  thought it lacked character and nose i may have been misinformed but i was expecting more very little peat or smoke  loved the guy comparing this to glenfiddich hahahahha good one  an excellent 10yr old the bourbon sherry cask mix works very well to make a very complex and rewarding drink with a balance of peat and honey finish is considerably longer than the age would suggest anyone who enjoys this malt should try to take a tour of the distillery which is an entirely by hand affair from malting to bottling five stars considering its peer age group  how do you find somebody who knows nothing about single malts scroll down to the people who don 39 t like this this is the benchmark for standard whiskies there isn 39 t a better or more complex 10 year old natural color and non chill filtered get this one folks and graduate to the educated malt drinkers  not the best taste in a whisky to be honest tastes slightly like medicine similar to laphroaig  welcome to springbank a great introduction to campbeltown the nose is rich and sharp once you acclimatise however it s all earthy dark fruits with that classic springbank medicinal twang the peat seems to dance around the rich costal flavours it manages to be well rounded all the way through from lips to finish 15 18yo make this look tame so if this is you re cup of tea they are highly recommended  medicine just medicine i love it clean mature earthy taste with fruit and eoody tones more please  smooth creamy fruity smoky with notes of caramel and wood  i had very high expectations for springbank 10 given the almost universal praise on whisky forums and youtube reviews after trying so many disappointing overhyped whiskies i was delighted to find that springbank not only met but exceeded my great expectations on the nose you get stone fruits rich honey and woody spice notes of cinnamon nutmeg and mace leave it a bit longer and you get some warm menthol tiger balmy notes on the tongue there is a rich sweet arrival that is similar to glenfarclas 12 i wonder whether this richness in taste is due to the direct firing of the stills anyway this sweetness develops into a gentle throat lozenge warmth before the peat really kicks in and leaves a peppercorn heat on the tongue mouthfeel is absolutely gorgeous up till now talisker was far and away the best 10 year old whisky i had but i think this is richer and more complex i still prefer talisker because its flavour profile appeals to me more but the quality of springbank cannot be ignored  i feel that the flavour is very harsh compared with say glenfiddich or many other fine scotch whiskeys  light peat smoke savory and sweet flavor overload  excellent and i mean excellent for a 10yr very well balanced and everything is there from peat smoke salt fruit etc a must try  when i think of malt 129347 this is the benchmark this has everything peat smoke salt fruit and a totally balanced dram from start to finish iechyd da  i don 39 t know why i have never tried this scotch even on quot lets try something new quot trips to the local liquor store i 39 ve only held it and nothing more until today lets call it highland park 12 yo 39 s younger genius 10 yo brother the nose satisfies your initial curiousity while drawing you in to dig deeper the palate is deep lively sweet smoky going through its paces but never dyingthe finish is just perfect dies away slowly and says come on back wow  97 100 97 100 one of the best 10 year olds in the market by far fabulous dram  stunning 10yrd better than some 18yrds complex amp balance would like to know what whisky 39 s some of the other reviewers are drinking if they think springbank us the worst whisky they 39 ve had it 39 s a brilliant 10 talisker and this unctious and sumptuous a cambeltown great  one of my favourite 39 bang for your buck 39 whiskies for a 10 year old it 39 s more complex than many an older whisky does the sweet to dry thing hint of peat smoke finish is good pretty much a 39 must have 39 whisky in my house  totally justifies it 39 s reputation as one of if not the best 10 yr olds on the market never without a bottle on my shelf ever  the only scotch i have such a negative feeling to undrinkable  my oh my balance is the key word wonderful nose of smoke peat vanilla ripe pears perhaps raspberries and something herbal pine needles maybe the palate develops something superb it starts sweet with fat oily vanilla and toffee progressing to citrus oranges and cinnamon and then fiery pepper the finish gets a little brine smoke peat and hints of leather with maybe just a hint of banana at the end it 39 s a unique whisky that deserves your time just wow  my bottle has been open 4 months now often compared to the 15yo and the 12cs so recently i laid my hands on the kilkerran 12 so it was time for a comparison verdict both such excellent whiskies each standing its own ground proudly but wow oh wow the ten now really impresses since the kilkerran 12 is such a stunner always well worth every penny campbeltown whiskies really take pride on my shelves excellently crafted  what a great whisky without the wallet taking a pounding it has all the taste variety of the islay malts campbeltown with glen scotia and springbank 10 are worthy of greater adulation easier on the wallet doesn t mean less on the palate  this is the first time i 39 ve reviewed a whisky so will keep it very simple just tasted my first dram of springbank 10 and am in whisky heaven right now it 39 s complex warm intoxicatingly rich and with a subtle peat and oaky finish that surpasses 10 years delicious will be ordering another bottle very very soon  very complex from the nose to the finish will definitely purchase another bottle  love this 10 year old  pound for pound one of the best entry level malts i 39 ve tasted and better than many pricier and older whiskies up there with ardbeg 10 bunnahabhain 12 and oban 14 for me and that 39 s high praise indeed  i 39 ve always known springbank is a unique whisky but it still took me 3 years of whisky adventures before i finally tried my first ever springbank yesterday the 10yo and it is unique indeed if anything it only reminds me a bit of classic laddie but nothing else it 39 s got loads of finesse elegance and balance perfection between the various elements bourbon and sherry casks a hint of peat salinity liquorice citrus smoke for some reason i 39 ve always had the impression that this should be a very punchy whisky but it 39 s actually just perfect a masterpiece for this age and price loving and recommending it  tried it for the first time and just loved it will definitely be buying a bottle  in my top 5 whiskeys 4 years into my whiskey adventure after trying a few 15 year old drams and its just as good as them well worth a punt sweet and subtle very well made quite balanced pleasant arrival good development and nice finish nutty and spicy notes very good does not need any water added  campbeltown single malt med en doft av citron s 228 lta banan persika mer exotiska frukter ek samt r 246 k smak uppfattas som ganska stark i smaken men d 228 r finns r 246 k kryddighet samt lite l 228 tt fruktig helt okej whisky som tyv 228 rr 228 r alldeles f 246 r dyr i sverige  haven 39 t tried the springbank 10 for a few years but upon returning to this beautiful malt i find that it is still as lovely as ever something i have noticed is that it can be a bit quot fiery quot when first opened which isn 39 t necessarily a bad thing however once you 39 ve drunk about a third of the bottle and given it a couple of weeks to quot breathe quot this initial sharpness disappears all in all a benchmark malt by which others should be measured and given the low cost of a bottle of this an example of how overpriced many lesser single malts are  islay was the gateway for me as it is for many such extraordinary whisky and marketing means that it has become a rite of passage since then i 39 ve tried and enjoyed almost everything islay has to offer not every 39 expression 39 of course that would be nuts and very expensive too but every distillery and nearly all the core line products and i 39 ve enjoyed many and loved a few however i do find a disconnect sometimes between the price tag and the stuff in the glass non age statement mega hyped whiskies that lack character or depth this 39 friend 39 however relativity recently discovered restores faith in all that is great about scotch it may naturally lack some of the subtlety or complexity of some older age statement whiskies but it is still seriously good stuff and just ridiculously good when you consider the cost less the 163 40 a bottle for anyone stuck on the islay bandwagon or just keen to discover great whisky i urge you to try this seriously delicious dram it 39 s a true benchmark of taste and quality i love it and i think you will too  i 39 m drinking a dram of this whilst listening to glasgow kiss by john petrucci in their own way both are exquisitely complex deeply rewarding and leave a lasting impression  one dram is all it took for me to fall in love with this my new favourite scotch being new to the world of whisky i have quickly gone from caol ila to laphroaig to ardbeg to old pultney and glenfiddich all have their upside some more than others but the springbank has a little something different maybe its the 46 alcohol content it 39 s bottled at or the fact that there 39 s no colour added or that it 39 s not chill filtered all these make it a strong flavourful scotch that i really love  i am relatively new to the world of single malt scotch just tried this one and reminds me of the benromach 10 year old only better benromach 10 year has been one of my faves and now this springbank 10 year will be there slightly ahead  solid dram bottle worthy for sure sweet with honey and a little dash of peat minor sugar on the nose along with sweet oranges  it is enigmatic and an acquired taste for sure first dram didn 39 t really do it for me but it 39 s one to experiment with non chillfiltered and natural colour are also positives good balance with no overpowering features from any of its attributes oily in texture with a hint of smoke and salt and a good balance of citrus vanilla and other fruit lightly spiced with a good finish  nose starts out as honey with a hint of orange and ends with burning smoke and leather further nosing brings up a herbal quality and stronger citrus along with the initial aromas palate is intense oily smoky honey and sea salt could literally spend hours nosing a dram of this surprisingly complex for a 10 year old and really opens up over time  incredible whisky for its price category deliciously bourbon sherry fruity with a touch of peat finely balanced and very drinkable  this is a whisky you can spend time with at first salty sour vinegar peat but add a few drops of water not too much let it breathe the sourness and turn into salty floral peat amazing with the key characteristics of a bourbon cask amazing craft orientated distillery  this is my first and only campbeltown whisky i 39 ve been able to find so far and it is awesome starts out fiery and oaky with hints of leather and seaweed very tangy and exciting also quite well rounded has all the things i like about scotch in one bottle if other campbeltown 39 s taste like this i want them in my collection this is good stuff the sugarbear the fact that springbank distillery still is the only one in the country that still carries out 100 of the whisky making process was enough to make me give it a go to the nose smells of orange peel and slight peat to the palate lovely smokiness vanilla and touch of sea salt excellent buy my brother in law loves it  when i first opened bottle it wasn 39 t anything special but in week when it i drank few drams it transfomed to very complex and delicius whisky very distincitive and interesting  have just compared this with hazelburn 10 and i am disappointed having expected the peated version to be superior it is inferior in all respects to the rather superb hazelburn and my peated favourite ledaig tasted 5 mins after opening and i could find nothing to recommend it but it should be noted that others have not enjoyed on first taste  i tasted some wiskies and have big expectations for this but i find lack of charackter and complexity must admit when i first tried this i was not quite sure about it love the islays and so many others but this is whisky in its own rite pleasant nose caramel and spices tastes of nuts and figs with oak and a little smoke though hardly perceptible really nice burn on the finish with some salt and seaweed love it i will be buying this often  smooth and distinctive  no doubt a wonderful whisky for those who drink it but it can make the drinker rather nasty and argumentative  from a neat pour i immediately got the sense of sweet smoke wet peat and smoked salt the palate is chewy and oily but slightly sulphured and dry on the trail end heavy oak notes and furniture polish lend way to the soft peated undertone with cold smoke and more briny coastal notes that follow the long finish projects a salty wash of seaweed accompanied by more smokiness that is so convencing it compells you to smell your own shirt while this is not close to what i prefer in a whisky as a taster i can appreciate the nuances this dram puts forth if you haven 39 t tried a springbank 10 get a sample from the chaps at master of malt if you like whisky you owe it to yourself to try this at least once it will gently nudge you to new flavors experiences and appreciations  not quite as easily approachable as other single malts and not for the novice drinker but once you give it time to relax and mellow my my will you be treated with awesomeness smell is subtle speyside peaty balanced goodness taste is quite complex but if were to describe it would be comparable to a highland park slightly less sweet but defenitely brinier  i happen to like a number of different whiskies but my favorite by far is springbank 10 yr i find that it has an excellent character with a smoky start to a long smooth finish i recommend pairing it with roquefort cheese on a multigrain baguette for a wonderful tasting experience  tried a sample as a friend recommended it to me and will be making it the next malt i buy a bottle of perfectly balanced for me the salinity is lovely and it was peatier than i expected which was nice as i m a big islay fan the tasting notes above pretty much nail it to be honest  always wanted to try this one first dram quot came out of the bottle angry quot and was not nice at all next day it was a very different whisky very accurate tasting notes from mom very drinkable benefits from a small drop of water and some time to open up and develop  i had this once and didn t like it but i presume the bottle had been open for some time on the shelf of a hole in the wall pub in scotland will be trying again for sure  smells just fantastic taste even better my first campbeltown and i am loving it smoky sweet salty fresh fruity and drying out in the finish i am hooked can the 15 y o be better than this  this is an excellent whisky smooth and smoky with a hint of salinity described as candied beef jerky i couldn t agree more i still have a bottle of springbank 18 to open will it be as good can it justify the price difference only time will tell  this is an excellent whisky smooth and smoky with a hint of salinity described as candied beef jerky i couldn t agree more i still have a bottle of springbank 18 to open will it be as good can it justify the price difference only time will tell  really enjoyable boasting a great maturity for a ten year old a fantastically atmospheric malt really enjoyable with seafood or even surf and turf nose earthy and warm spicy peatiness melds with salt caramel very harmoniously palate full with barley sweetness like riding a wave of salted caramel with that beautifully balanced peat weaving its way into the medley finish rich smoke sweetness gives way to a salty tang long and satisfying oak infused with the smells and tastes of the coast  this is my first bottle of campbeltown and i m not dissapointed this offers something very different from the rest of my collection intense oak and damp earth with a lovely middle sweetness and strong sea air and brine has a lot to offer for a 10yo ncf thumbs up no caramel colour two thumbs up what a cracking dram and agreat standard expression 15 yo next  to me it was really a bourbon barrel edition though it had t the freshness of bourbon bruicladdich editions non chill filtered and no caramel added this is a very good 10yo incarnation  definately more peaty than i d thought it would be it s the first thing that hits you on the nose and it stays in the taste its most defining characteristic to me at any rate is its combination of oaky dryness and subtle tropical fruityness particularly if you give it a little splash of water and a couple of minutes in the glass i didn t get many of the typical sherry notes save for a slightly sulphorous overtone on the nose a particularly dry tangy malt with mild peaty smokiness always present very nice stuff 
2030.0, very smooth and pleasant a bit too light for my taste i would expect more complexity at this age it 39 s very much in line with the other glenfarclas whiskies i 39 ve tasted it 39 s pleasant but misses that little extra bite at this price you can get a lot of whiskies that are more interesting  simply beautiful i discovered this one whilst visiting the highlands in 2017 a nice mellow taste of sherry with a slight smokey undertone  i have long been an island malt man in search of that perfect stormy night on a sea weedy beach taste and aroma so its a while since i tried a glenfarclas although this is a speyside it almost takes me there and its smooth and refined as well i like this a lot  green and ferny nettles very green after a year and a half with air in the bottle very green  very smooth spicy but not burning sherry comes through not over powering  could not wish for a better dram beyond my expectations 5 stars mark one i had was cask strength 51 4  wau this is one of the best 21 out there and the best for the price but not for the boys this in the gentleman 39 s stuff elegant silky smooth nothing but true pleasure on nose and palate except for those who has ruined their senses with the harsh stuff keep the bottles on store i will pick them one by one there is nothing disturbing in this it is very rare for a whisky overall is almost perfect i like glendronach 21 as well but it has totally different approach than glenfarclas both are true masterpieces in whiskyworld best blended one for me is nikka from the barrel again masterpiece of its own  do i detect a hint of truffles in this  it is a very pleasant whisky but from my point of view it is not as good as glendronach glenmorangie or arran whiskys it 39 s like it misses a little something to be on the top i like it but will not buy again  as many others have pointed out this whisky needs some time to open up the first few drams were a bit underwhelming but once it truly opens up it becomes a great whisky plenty of ethanol with a dry and masculine palate with a wonderful finish maybe not the right whisky for sherry and peat lovers the glenfarclas 21 beauty lies in it 39 s simplicity and strong character  good and smooth with chocolate even better lovely whisky opens up more easily than 25 great flavours that really linger and are memorable very good price last time i bought it 163 82 so well worth with and a very rewarding amazing single malt experience truly yummy 128526  nae bad a really delightful and super reasonably priced whisky to enjoy yourself or impress guests this whisky is nothing flashy and alternative it 39 s not take your breath away new and quirky drinking it 39 s a super mellow super smooth sipper and the oils will leave such a delightful deep rich and smooth flavour in your mouth with all of those nice deep sherry cask flavours but with the 21 years mellowed and combined to produce a truly tasty wee dram it is also an eye pleasingly designed bottle to have on the shelf or in the cabinet  too many rookies here marking whiskies well below what they really are it takes experience to truly understand scotch and how different each and every single one can be as an experienced drinker i realize there is no such thing as the perfect scotch and why should there be life is imperfect and its what makes scotch so amazing glenfarclas is a fantastic distillery with its own character cant be to everyones taste like women the 21 is a fantastic dram for me mature sexy full of character ive had this 21 in my collection for 3 years now a sign that i just cant part with this one just yet needs to be savored until the last drop as with most i mean all scotches do not be so quick to critisize your bottle after the first second third fourth dram every single bottle ive oppened and had the first few drams im always dissapointed in sone way with experience you learn to overcone that i aknowledge the fact that it needs to breathe you should too patience my friends complex nose and a pleasant but not very interesting palate  loved it more with every sip oily very oaky and with caramel and vanilla thick and full the complexity is ironically based on its simple bold and oily character fruit punch malt and butterscotch with a hint of salt pecan and nutmeg i like very much  notes of sherry fruit and caramel  nice flavor but not very complex  a masterful 21 year old rich complex and oily at the price point it 39 s virtually unbeatable smooth and oily very pleasant and well priced for the age  is it me am i being pedantic why is it that the critics of this magnificent whisky a can 39 t spell b prefer the 105i suspect their palates are yet to grow up like them  one beautiful sip after another  i hope they will not increase the pricing of the glenfarclas and turn it into a quot luxury brand quot  came as part of a tasting kit which included 2 miniatures of the 21 and 25 and a 70cl of the 15 yo i 39 ve had the 15 before and loved it definitely in my top five the 25 is delicious and moreish too but the 21 was disappointing as others have said it lacks depth and complexity there are better whiskys at this price  light dry sweet slightly floral notes vanilla pine cones one of the few summer whiskies very smooth can drink neat easily very nice whisky found flavour improved once opened a few days  so many reviews conflicting here i too enjoy 105 and the other similar cs releases but this 21 yr is not that at all so much more complex and worth the time by design it has less sherry which uncovers many more flavors that raisons and the normal 39 farclas cherry vanilla spices like allspice and nutmeg citrus rich vanilla mint don 39 t compare this to a port wood and strongly finished malt it is more virgin like and pure not covered up with a kick in the teeth 21 years give it time take a few drams out leave it alone for a month then start the journey respect  save it for a special occasionbecause it goes fast very smooth pairs well with all foods  smooth sherried dram with chocolate and coffee this is an excellent whisky great also without chocolate some citrus  my guess is the casks may have been refilled too many times before putting this down not much wood or sherry for something of this age my patate may yet be a bit naieve but i much prefer the glenfarclas 105  i stole this heading from a gent before who reviewed this malt i think it somes it up well it 39 s a very smooth cherried malt nice finnish but not overly long great price point but not overly complex this is a lovely malt and i really liked it but i expected more from a malt if this age   quot i 39 ve found that as the bottle has gone down the whisky has really opened up and revealed its true character quot that 39 s glenfarclas alright regardless of which 39 farclas bottle one buys it 39 s best to wait for a few weeks after opening the bottle and taking the first glass before going any further and usually it takes a few months for their whisky to settle down and show all its colors  in the interests of fairness i thought i should correct my previous review where i stated that this whisky was disappointing i 39 ve found that as the bottle has gone down the whisky has really opened up and revealed its true character a lesson for me in the power of oxidisation apologies to glenfarclas this is a very nice whisky with a depth of flavour that perhaps takes some time to reveal itself in the end i would have to say that in my opinion it is superior to the 15 there is a dryness in the finish of the 15 which i think detracts from the experience the finish on the 21 is longer sweeter and more complex ymmv  great nose lots of orange a bit too much alcohol on the palate a bit hot harsh not bad like the balvenie 15 and the glenlivet 18 better love the 15 great value for money and a very satisfying whisky tried the 12 and thought it was ok for the money but there are better options in this price range the 21 is exactly as the previous two reviwers have stated no complexity or depth of flavour particularly for a 21 year old whisky i would choose the 12 over the 21 but wouldn 39 t buy either again the 15 is definitely the one to go for in my opinion makes me wonder if glenfarclas are flogging this one as a cheap 21 year old to people who don 39 t know any better and buy on the quot 21 quot factor alone has really diminished my respect for glenfarclas although i will continue to buy the 15 if it maintins its current qualiity  very smooth but i agreed with the gent before me it lacked complexity and the draw to drive me to buy a bottlegive me the 25 year all day at 75 more yes it 39 s smooth but it 39 s not very rewarding no conplexity no caracter i like the 15 yo better  i love this whisky i love the aromas the flavours and the mouthfeel sweet and rich and creamy hard to savour because i want more  a very palatable and smooth whisky but i was expecting a little more from a 21 year old lacked the complexity and depth normally associated with a malt of this age  so light and smooth you will as the tasting notes above say be wanting some more almost as good as the 40 year old but at completely different ends of the intensity spectrum  wow just wow so smooth one of my new favs and certain to buy another when my bottle runs out  rubbish would never buy again i think it has something to do with it being closed i have a bottle from 2011 and when i first opened it the one scent that dominated everything was as you said old wet wood but after a prolonged oxidation in the bottle with some air and a little perseverance it opened up to a wonderful dark fruit christmas cake flavor profile so according to my experience it might be the whisky being closed as i also had the wet wood treatment that was so bad i directly thought the particular bottle i had was bad or just a duffer so a usefull tip give it time lotsa time  i must ve gotten a bad bottle the first time i purchased this from a shop serious taste of old wet wood with everything else quite diminished and and a quickly disappearing aftertaste the one i m tasting right now has much bolder aromas with none of that soggy cask taste to taint it and it lingers on the tongue and in the throat much longer good stuff for the price it commands  yes you get peppermint and citrus a whole range of whisky tastes oak is there as always it is whisky after all to describe it as harsh in this case is to me simply wrong while i don t entirely disagree with previous comments i want to comment on the smoothness and lingering special after taste  nose lots of nose oak and harsh wood of course vanilla nuts and sherry taste again harsh wood strong and bold bubbly and lovelysummary lots of character peppery very nice balance light and a feeling of summer smooth and complex not that much sherry as hoped but still a great whisky jens www chwisgi com prova peppermint yes nose and palate also some green grass long long finish bittersweet less fruit cake than the 15 year for sure but some citrus in the background rounded and smooth indeed is it too rounded and smooth for its own good 
1715.0, off for that nightcap then  i 39 ve recently opened this after hanging on to it for close to ten years and the four cities i 39 ve lived in that time glad i never let it go amazingly lively orange toffee and mint a little earthy smoke  found a bottle about 8 months ago must be one of the last on the planet this is the best i 39 ve had please make more  let this sit for about 5 mins after pouring and you are in for a treat  nice whisky in a cold night 
48327.0, had this after the 105 comparatively as spicy but less alcohol burn sips at a slower pace than say bulleit 10yo bourbon less woody and rum sweet as well as such nearly finished the entire bottle in a week dwill look for 17 and 12 for contrasts  ok with an ice cube but straight up tastes like petrol let 39 s see if it gets better after keeping the bottle open  i would love to like this bottle for an 18 yo it seems good value for a 1l bottle then you realise why is it always the 17yo cost more the taste profile is largely ok sweet sherry vanila note with nuttiness and typical apple from speyside zero smoke quite bright for an afternoon dram but it also tasted quite sharp for its age i would expect smoother finish for an 18yo and the relatively low abv the finish is a little too tannic very unsettling numbness makes you feel that it was sitting inside a tired cask made out of cheap construction wood this is no where near a good representation of glenfaclas dont buy this just because you wanted a cheap 18yo go get the 17 or anything else in the glenfaclas range  a truly great whisky i bought a bottle for my 60th birthday and our 38th wedding anniversary and i gave to say both my mrs and myself really liked it and so did our friends and family  when i first tasted this i would give it a 2 star simply because it has a very unpleasant metalic finish and that umpleasantness stays for very long and after a while thats all i tasted but this whisky grows on me 1 4 through the bottle and i am starting to enjoy this one more and more  just let this one rest a bit a few drops of water and you are in for a real positive surprise don 39 t dive in 1 minute after you opened the bottle i suspect some nay sayers here did just that  this is awful whisky no one should buy this terrible leave it to me to drink all buy myself at this price honestly epic whisky beautifully rounded and poised astonishing value at this price for 1l pour and let it sit for 30 mins or so with half a teaspoon of water wow citric toffee with layers of dark fruit probably my favourite speyside so far gets better and better the more i drink it  didn 39 t care for this one the nose is alright with notes of fresh fruit and honey along with a touch of dried fruits suspect old sherry casks have been used re fill and 3rd fill however there is something off on the palate like it 39 s gone bad it is sweet and fruity and mellow but there is an off note like it 39 s been tainted by a rotten stave if there was such a thing  i prefer 12 years compared to this the nose was good but finishing not impressed  like this one better at 2nd attempt flavours seemed more forthcoming in second bottle don 39 t know why a yummy little dram on a cold winter evening very good and quite toffee butterscotch at times like the 17 yr old  not up to the mark 12 years better 18 finishing was rough strange to see people saying it s the same as the 12 yr old it s very different in my opinion a great dream which can be acquired at a very decent price  nice dram with a dry finish pricewise a safe bet  having had the 12yo i bought a bottle of the 18yo however this one is actually less good than the 12yo never had this experience before better stick to the 12yo next time nose i did not like taste does not differ much from the 12yo  well for the price it was justified i enjoyed the drink  like the woman of the hills this dram is not for the faint of heart it is truley the tipple for the connoisseur i 39 m not insinuating that it will drink your blood but if the baobhan sith gets her teeth into you she will be in for a pleasant surprise  very interesting drink i drink 18yo with its 12yo side by side it 39 s the same drink 
103339.0, so i have the smoky 12 and smoke season both from benriach in my cabinet i have not yet tasted the ss its fairly new but had a taste of the s12 last night its meh definitely not smoky if you are fan of islay whiskies but that said its not a bad whisky by any means i will spend more time with it over the following weeks and hope it opens up some smoky notes speaking to the specialty whisky store i purchased from apparently the smoke season is quite the hit i may also open that up in the coming weeks as well and it will be nice to compare enjoy sadly it does not hold up over time after opening and with 3 5 left in the bottle it has lost some of its attributes ashy smoke and sweetness is still present but the fruitiness wears off it is still a decent deam but others just does it better i d prefer birnie moss or kilchoman vintage over this  just great lots going on and a wonderful balance between sweetness and smokiness  just great lots going on and a wonderful balance between sweetness and smokiness  smokehead ardbeg talisker are all my firm favourites this has just been added cream honey and smoke all with enough prominence to enrich the depth of every sip as soon i saw it was 46 i knew it was going to be something special and it was  this is a good dram very easy too drink and smooth and a good taste worth a try any day cheers do not add water it kills this dram stone dead saying that it is not a bad dram not harsh in any way and smokey rather than peaty it lingers on the palate very pleasantly and i would buy it again  loving the marsala maturation in this dram amazing orange and chocolate notes
2536.0, the best whisky sven erik sweden mac 12 has been my fav over 15 years they changed no sherry or vanilla noy worth buying excellent caramel with a beautiful texture the longer it sits on the palate  cool i m a regular 12 year old double cask fan it s my go to drink i thought i d tray myself and this was such a let down it s 50 more price and tastes harsher the first sip is too alcohol forward seems to me all they did was added 3 to the alcohol and added 50 to the pricestick with the double cask this is my go to 12 year old whisky it is consistently excellent with a wonderful sherried flavour sweet but not too much so and a long woody aftertaste that lingers yes it 39 s around 163 70 so comparatively expensive to other 12 39 s but worth it in my opinion it never lasts long on my shelf  i used to drink macallan 10 sherry and if we could get it 12 sherry wood it has been probably 10 years since i last purchased macallan in any form and with what they are charging for it these days its frankly depressing i recently tried before lockdown the recent 12 sherry wood with my friend leigh from canada and he used to be a great fan of the 12 bottled at 43 abv big disappointment from both of us and we agreed if you want a good sherry hit we would rather buy a springbank 15 and for considerably less price i recently spoke to my local whisky retailer and he said macallan is a shadow of the whisky we had in the 80s and 90s that is a big malt specialist that told me that wake up macallan and go back to better casks that have held sherry for years not just been rinsed also up the abv as 163 80 for a so so macallan is taking the mick leigh said i can buy nearly 2 better whiskies for what is being asked for what is called a good macallan these days i 39 m reviewing the u s 43 imported version from the moment you handle the substantially weighted bottle remove the quality capsule extract the well fitting cork and inhale you are aware of something special it follows through to the long thick legs sliding down the sides of the glass rich aromatic unctuous spirit follows that does not disappoint i suspect this is where the value point is slides down like sweet oil cost au 200 but well worth it  one of the great 12 yr olds this dried fruit a little spice sherry everywhere yet so well balanced and considering the amount of sherry so smooth as well macallan have always been famed for their wood sherry prominent this is whyworth more than 5 really even if its not cheap as a sherry forward dram its hard to beat it really struth i used to love the standard macallan 12 when it had no branding on the oak or the sherry or the number of barrels always kept a bottle on the shelf and occasionally treated myself to the similarly branded macallan 18 but ever since they started on this path of fine oak sherry oak double barrel etc i 39 ve been trying to find the equivalent of the wonderful old macallan 12 unfortunately this is certainly not it not even close it lacks the depth richness balance and complexity of the old 12 year to me it tastes like they literally dumped some sherry into a young spirit and bottled it i was a long time mac devotee but their expansion into their monstrous industrial scale distillery and all this re branding has diminished their product significantly i can 39 t help but think old michael jackson would be very disappointed in what they 39 ve become  well this is my first taste of a macallan i have a bottle of macallan rare cask that i 39 ve not yet opened as it was bought for my birthday and bought this as a kind of test to see what delights i 39 m in for my palate and smell isn 39 t the most honed and although i have a very sensitive sense of smell i can rarely pick out the different flavours that get mentioned i just like what i like 39 sherry bomb 39 is a phrase that 39 s bandied around a lot at the moment if you watch any whisky videos on youtube with dried fruits and raisins cropping up a lot with sherry casked whiskies well with this macallan even i can smell the fruits the nose doesn 39 t so much fill the glass as whack you round the face with a bunch of grapes it 39 s almost too much but not the nose is actually more potent than the palate for me and makes for a whiskey that defies it 39 s 12 years of age never had anything like it i tried it alongside a glenlivet 18 just for random comparison and the glenlivet 18 is quite bland next to the macallan for 39 bland 39 read 39 more subtle 39 i feel i need to drink a lot more to really form a true opinion but for the moment it 39 s delicious and a world away from my other speyside whiskies not better or worse just different is it worth twice the price of many other 12 year olds yes yes it is if you like this sort of thing it is very sweet on the nose more like an actual sherry than a whisky it 39 s still strong on the tongue but far less sherry and more like you 39 d expect from a good whisky and very smooth is it worth 163 70 depends on your taste i 39 d say i think it 39 s too expensive myself and will try the double cask next  i have always thought macallan survives more on it 39 s legend and hype than the true nature of it 39 s product that 39 s why they can charge the prices they do that 39 s not to say this isn 39 t a fine scotch it is but it 39 s not what i personally want out of a whisky that uses 39 sherry cask 39 as it 39 s selling point so if it 39 s your thing enjoy but it 39 s likely to be a while before i pay this amount for another bottle  after a break in the sherry cask whisky 39 s in australia it 39 s nice to see this 12 yo offering back lovely spiced fruity notes on the nose from those oloroso casks that medium dry construct but there are still malty amp peaty characters with great appeal beautiful brassy bronze colour the palate is sweet spicy lively long amp soft it 39 s like drinking a lovely old barolo or rioja just plain sexy picked this up for about 35 cheaper than the listed price thank you taiwan only tried a non age statement macallan before this is the first i tried with one and i like it i don 39 t think the sherry flavor is super strong but is detctable what i really like about this is the spiciness like an oak spiciness on the palate that lingers in the after taste it gives it a different dimension and makes it pretty tasty for the price is paid i feel fine for the price listed here however i would have to say that it 39 s just too much and that there is better on the market for such a price overall though a nice whisky  this is a fairly nice one on the nose you can pick up the sherry as you sip its quite hot and you get a little burn soon fades and you get a loverly sweet aftertaste it is very sweet i 39 m finding it 39 s a nice one but i do feel it 39 s overpriced if this was cheaper i would give better stars but for value i can 39 t help but feel there 39 s better out there  smooth easy drinking at a reasonable price there s nothing better than having a bottle of macallan waiting for you when you get home from a hard day s work  simply too sweet it overpowers everything not dissimilar to syrup 39 o 39 figs laxative i find it hard to believe it hasn 39 t had corn syrup dropped in it not for me though my wife loves it  very sherry and sweet honey spicy oak floral some people get a sort of synthetic or rubber taste from this which i can definitely see it does have a sort of different taste compared to other single malts that make it unique as far as the scotch itself goes the quality is great and the taste is good no color added is a bonus i d give it an 85 100 however it loses points and my future business for the recent price increases which have made it unreasonable i ve seen 10 15 dollars price increases depending on where i shop within the last few months and there are too many other great options in that price range so once again in typical macallan fashion they take a good product at a decent price and increase it to an unreasonable level for what it is  some days i taste this and i think it s amazing some days it kind of tastes synthetic almost i can tell that it is a quality scotch there s no question about it they honey and sherry shine in this one and nothing tastes similar to it sad that recent price increases have moved it up into a league of better drams for the price macallan is quality it is good it is overpriced  must to have really enjoyable but for someone starting out drinking there are better sherry aged scotches at the price point saw it today at cosco for 54 99 and thought i would revisit it same opinion as before especially if you are on a tight budget the corporate name branding marketing etc really pump the price on this relative to other 12 year old ones having turned my back on scotch several decades ago mostly due the low availability of decent brands here i decided to re acquaint myself with the spirit the double cask was recommended by a friend who writes wine and whisky revoews for a local magazine i managed to find it at our small store and opened it with some trepidation i was blown away with the rich smoothness of it i may put my bourbons on the back shelf  good but feel it should be better somehow could be smoother more full flavoured i prefer the triple wood expression as i drank both bottles side by side over the course of several months both got better as time went by but the triple wood more so would i buy either again if on offer yes i would both are a great product  i enjoyed it very much will recommend to all there was one issue i have is that i can not access your website in the united states the 12 seems to come in two different bottles and different prices one the original is in a plain bottle selling for less and significantly smoother what changed with the new bottle and black box both are 41 alc  i don 39 t know for the price this dissapoint i think it was a little waterish good taste of sherry dried fruit sweet and a little spicy and taste of oak on the finish this review is based on a 3cl sample  toffe dried fruit and a malty sweetness on the nose citrus with a fruity background on the palate finishes with a sherry oaky sweetness with some spice great sweet a very nice whisky beautiful color fruit and sherry flavors a deep and rich pallet to continue  smooth with a nice sweetness warming but not a burn great for new comers i am a whisky noob  i would be very happy if this was the only 12 year that i could drink for the rest of my life  summary sums it up smooth smooth smooth and rich beautiful color a bit too sweet from a bit too much sherry but pleasant honeycomb toffee vanilla and sherry flavor it is rich in flavour dense on the palate creamy texture and exceedingly long finish worth every penny i paid  the nose on this scotch is like sniffing a band aid with hints of sulfur however the palate is deep rich and viscous it is good and i enjoy it but dalmore 12 is better in my opinion  there are better values out there but macallan brings 100 quality at 60 a bottle it is like drinking lightly smoked butterscotch with a side of the best fruits wrapped up in a quality oak finish the nose and taste linger with you long after the glass is empty the 86 proof gives it a nice kick without being overbearing or causing a light hangover like the glenmorangie line which are still very good but are lower quality alcohol at 50 a bottle it would be either the best or second best value in the market so i don t get that worked up over the extra 10 in price though mom s 81 shipping is prohibitive i have a soft spot for the glenlivet line since my palate loves excellent champagne and pears especially the 15 and 21 though the 12 is consistently underrated and is the best value overall but macallan is a close second as a brand every macallan i ve had provided the same remarkable consistency and character with complexity and intensity increasing with the age one whiff just screams macallan when the cork pops and the amber settles at least with the sherry oaks i haven t made it past the excellent 18 yet but i definitely look forward to the day when i can give the 25 and 30 a go regardless the 12 will always have a place on my shelf in my experience macallan even wins over the curmudgeonly peat lovers through its complexity thankfully macallan doesn t veer into that overly complex realm of burnt tires salty fish and cough medicine like the islay peat bombs every once in a while i enjoy a lagavulin or a laphroaig but i wouldn t even consider either as a regular dram macallan earns that nod with distinction cheers  really enjoyable but for someone starting out drinking there are better sherry aged scotches at the price point saw it today at cosco for 54 99 and thought i would revisit it same opinion as before especially if you are on a tight budget the corporate name branding marketing etc really pump the price on this relative to other 12 yos  beautiful and smooth i am a big fan of macallan but i have to admit that for the price there are malts out there which are better value for money glenmarangie quinta ruban at around 40 pounds glenfiddich 18 and if you are lucky the glenlivet 18 can be be purchased for around the 60 pounds mark better malts interesting to say the least this is a sherry whisky but there is an unusual peat taste to it as well frsit the peat hit you though it 39 s not the most powerful the the sherry creeps up from the back of the mouth and removies the peat taste that said i have had better  for me the eternal beginner because i feel what i feel without knowing or distinguishing the flavours but one thing i know what is good for me i feel this is a quality malt whisky sophisticated and refined reminds me somehow glengoyne 21 as happened with the macallan 12 fine oak that reminds me the glengoyne 12 this macallan 12 sherry cask is sweet complex medium to long finish with reminiscence of bourbon good malt flavour and also is too expensive for me i still prefer glengoyne for my taste has open flavours while refined and sophisticated too and less expensive  after trying the 1841 replica which i love very much which is in a class by itself nonetheless this is a close second with only a slight varence in the flavor as for the price it can be found at lower prices if you look but it 39 s a great scotch pairs well a variety of cigars and i will look forward to trying the other macallan 39 s and aged varieties give it a try you 39 ll love it  i know macallan has a hardcore following and it was due to the many reviews i ve read when folks have raved about it that made me try a bottle but i didn t find it any better than any other similar scotch in the same price bracket in fact there s many better for the price and much cheaper imho i was slightly underwhelmed and found it overrated i hoped there would be a little more 39 sherryness 39 in it for one thing and don t get me wrong it 39 s adequate but i look for more than 39 adequate 39 when i pay this amount per bottle  being of scottish decent playing the great highland bagpipes this finest of single malt whisky once filled my flask and my evenings after dinner sad to say the macallan 12 is history it has become too pricey once it could be purchased for around 42 00 a fair price now at 72 00 a bottle not comparing tradition it is way beyond my price range there are many other alternative single malts available still today for 42 00 that can closely fill my flask  this whiskey is something that just gets better and better one of the first that i started drinking and i must say it is a timeless classic  i was in scottland 2 years ago was told that macallan was no longer distilling their 12 year old sherry oak and when the existing stock ran out that would be it don 39 t know if what i was told is true or not but upon returning home i purchased a case at 36 99 a bottle i thought it was a steal judging by today 39 s price i guess i was right love it nice silky feel in the mouth pronounced sweet sherry taste subtle hint of heather goes down smooth enjoy it like all my single malts neat no ice no water sadly as much as i love it can 39 t justify paying the new price i have three bottles left will gift them to my three sons on their 21st birthdays  i rather drink my own pee it 39 s disgustingly awful and it wouldn 39 t even be fit for washing my ass with it  wonderful single malt scotch clean full and uncomplicated  there 39 s not a single first fill sherry cask in this stuff  definitely a classic this is an awesome sherry malt oh so smooth  if you want to try some classic single malts this one would never let you down  simplemente excelente  don 39 t get me wrong its a great whisky i finished my bottle in 3 days for the price point a bit overrated drinking back to drinking black bush which matures in sherry casks for 1 3 of price  this is my favorite speyside bar none the sherry really colors the whisky on my palate perhaps a bit too much but still lovely  talisker in winter otherwise m12 the go to after dinner  i generally stay away from mac 39 s because they 39 re a little on the pricy side but i bit the bullet on this one after reading some good reviews undoubtedly the sherry comes through which i like and i found that theres something a little different in there compared to others of the same ilk that i cant quite put my finger on yet which i 39 ll enjoy trying to get it 39 s undoubtedly a quality product but i wont be rushing to buy another at the price quoted here when theres so many others of a similar quality that give better value for less moolah  this is my favourite spirit the sherry note is inviting as well as pleasurable i have approx 10 20 different spirit opened at a given time however this macallan is my daily dram cheers i love this speyside and i 39 m quite particular excellent flavor well balanced great warmth and very smooth can 39 t believe it 39 s under 100 this will always be in my cabinet  i just bought a pint of macallan 12 for the first time and all i can say is wow along with a string of expletives used in the most positive sense this is hands down the best speyside single malt i 39 ve ever tasted and amongst the best in general though tend to be partial to islay single malts i 39 m going to have one more wee dram then set the rest of the pint aside with my collection  100 the best scotch i have ever had i 39 ve tasted a few including multiple different kinds of johnny walker which were all just god awful and left a terrible smokey taste in my mouth afterwards and glenfiddich which was pretty good a little watered down i felt like this was by far the best i wouldn 39 t change anything about it incredible  for the price i find it spot on when i indulge in single malt tasty and stout this is a wonderful 12 year old probably the best i 39 ve had but macallan is seriously overpriced the absolute cheapest i 39 ve found it is 51 99 just can 39 t compete price wise with others in this age range but then again it 39 s certainly one of the best  lately i have been spoiling myself and drinking nothing but yamazaki 12 and my personal favorite the 18 year along with some hibiki 21 year i can 39 t say i personally like this better but for the price a hint of quot medicinal quot nose similar to laphroaig full oaky palate with a bit of sweetness not overly dry lingering finish that 39 s pleasant  this is the first scotch i have ever liked  absolutely the finest scotch whisky i 39 ve ever tasted a friend shared a drink with me the other day and now i 39 m sold just picked up a bottle today it is by far the very best  hands down cleanest best for single malt scotch on the planet presently am a former johnnie black on ice guy now it 39 s mac12 neat  this is my new favorite single malt since green label nowadays is very rare and only available in taiwan i believe macallan should be able to replace it in a heartbeat smooth sweet and bold  excellent sherry balanced and simple taste sweet honey long finish  i like this whiskey the description is pretty accurate but what it doesn 39 t mention is the sulfur initially rather smooth but full a touch of sweetness almost fruitiness to it a solid oak finish i really want to love this scotch i do the ultimate downfall is the sulfur it 39 s just a touch too much for my liking to the point that it kills what would otherwise be a fantastic array of flavors my nose isn 39 t the best so the sulfur isn 39 t too much of a problem there but it kills the taste good but losing that would make it much better i 39 ll finish the bottle sure but i 39 m not overly impressed   too pricey mac12 saw a 15 price increase over past couple months where i 39 m from  macallan 18 is us 230 to 235 and can buy the 12 at total wine in phoenix for us 42 00 i would buy and drink the 12 even if the prices were reversed i 39 m one of those heathens that can 39 t pick up the many smells and tastes but i 39 m working on that and even without them i really enjoy a taste of this whiskey also really like the sienna but have to pay close to 200 00 for 750 ml in canada so the 12 wins  just like it says above crisp and sweet and not too complex as i 39 m sure the older ones would be notes of salt and bitterness but followed by a sweet note after about 2 3 minutes into the drink floral notes pop out and flavor is very nice not heavy like the scotch 39 s from islay of course the sherry casks greatly add to the characteristics of the flavor only picked up a little 50ml and when the time comes to buy the 750ml i will not hesitate can 39 t wait to enjoy this again ps this is coming from a 21 year old who truly enjoys this my first but not last macallan  definitely one of the finest single malts available the sherry notes complement the warm earthy tones of the full body macallan and are stronger than other sherry cask malts i 39 ve tasted excellent nose taste and finish  it 39 s like that you are smells something different which rewards you with full satisfaction  ultra sulfured upon opening had to set aside for a while few months after opening and came back and it was pretty decent i doubt i would ever buy another bottle however so many other great options for the same or less to compare my other open bottles at the moment are yamazaki 12 aberlour 16 glenlivet 15 elijah craig 12yr bourbon and my trusty friend jameson i 39 d buy all of these again before another macallan 12 macallan 39 s parent company is frankly out of control but the mac 12 while it lasts is still one of the two best 12 year sherry matured single malts you can buy glendronach being the other especially here in the us where we get the 43 abv version fabulous nose with hints of vanilla and ripe red berries and just a touch of cinnamon with maple syrup leads into a terrific body and more of that great sherry the finish doesn 39 t last long enough but whats there is wonderful vanilla with just a distant hint of caramelized sugar yes it 39 s overpriced but that is a result of supply and demand edrington can get away with this on the age statement stuff because it 39 s still great a testament to the people who work at the actual distillery they obviously are working very hard to turn out a product this excellent at the massive volumes they are working at no small feat  one of best whiskey i 39 ve ever taste i love the smoothness of it i think it 39 s safe to say this is my drink of choice from now on nelson one the better scotches i 39 ve tried very smooth with some spice hints of oak and honey other reviews share experiences of a sulfur odor being a pharmacist i can assure you in all the bottles of mac 12 i have imbibed there was never any such smell it is my daily sipper  i had a double pour of mac 39 12 yesterday at blue ginger in wellesly mass it would be an understatement to say it was fabulous it 39 s all it should be  would not buy it again glad i tried it my mind may change as i work through the bottle but the sulfur smell is really off putting for me my wife did not mind it though one of the things i like about discovering scottish whiskies is that they seem to try to be unique whereas here in tennessee they are all trying to be the same it took me over half a bottle of talisker 10 before i started to appreciate its quot unique quot flavor still won 39 t buy another bottle  boy oh boy yamazaki 18 is hard to get in us i 39 ve got 3 left if you try this wow mcallan 25 don 39 t stand up anyone agree  je croyais que ce whisky 233 tait supprim 233 et effectivement je ne le voyais plus sur les 233 tag 232 res de mes fournisseurs depuis fort longtemps et cette semaine je d 233 couvre quelques flacons je n 39 ai pu r 233 sister 224 la tentation et malgr 233 le prix de 89euros j 39 en ai pris 2 je ne sais si c 39 est une queue de stock r 233 apparaissant avant extinction totale et d 233 finitive ou si macallan a relanc 233 sa commercialisation mais voil 224 je viens d 39 en ouvrir une et ben c 39 est toujours aussi bon et gourmand c 39 est vraiment dommage que des whiskies embl 233 matiques disparaissent  compared to the 10 years old this one does not deliver up to expectations the 10 year old is much more balanced  my first entcounter with macallan it is a nice sherried whisky where you can tell that quality casks have been used not that complex but very enjoyable and educational medium length finish i recommend it  i bought this for 60 cad brought it from the us for that price i feel its a good product i 39 ve tried many scotches and i can say if you want something that is rich creamy and with some sherry notes this is what you need its not overly complex its creamy and sweet i 39 d have to say i prefer this to the glendronach 12 mac 12 has more body and richness but if you like something more fruity go for the glendronach 12overall this is an excellent product too bad they don 39 t sell it in canada anymore i 39 d give it a 5 but its overpriced  i think i avoided this one because it 39 s just so popular but i bought a 50ml bottle from the local liquor store and it was so good even this small sample bottle comes in a nice box and a glass bottle and honestly is one of the best drams i 39 ve had to date super smooth the oak really comes through and just the right amount of sherry one of the few where i feel that the nose mouth and finish are all relatively consistent i 39 ll be replacing my glenlivet 12 with this as my daily dram  spicy little oaky but smooth honey taste stays in mouth i continue to buy this whisky it 39 s sweet holds well on the palate and is full of flavour i cannot understand a negative review one of my favourite whiskies having been a fan for many years it won 39 t disappoint  not sure about the quot sulfur quot being mentioned in some of these reviews and was reluctant to try it i found it to be actually one of the best i will always have a bottle of this around and i will not let reviews deter me in the future this is a fine whisky maybe the competitors put up false reviews it 39 s honestly that good i simply don 39 t believe the negative comments  strong sherry taste with a hint of sweetness this scotch and glenmorainge lasanta are very similar in my opinion just a notch below yamazaki 12yr i have tried many different brands but this one is really omg love it  the trouble is people with little experience of malt don 39 t know how to taste they don 39 t know how get the best out of whisky and then leave unjustifiable poor reviews  just got a bottle for 70 in ga 1st macallan and it 39 s really good i 39 m probably going back to get another bottle before i 39 m 1 2 done w this one new ish to whisky but this one is superb bought a bottle of this here in fukuoka japan for 4500 yen and couldn 39 t believe the amount of sulphur on the nose really put me off the whisky it 39 s unfortunate because on the palate it was quite nice and i 39 ll certainly finish the bottle but it will be the last one i buy for 5200 yen i can buy a glenfarclas 15 or for 6300 yen i can get a glendronach 15 both of these whiskies are far superior in my opinion i think macallan are kidding themselves you can only ride on a reputation for so long before people wake up very disappointed on the bright side whisky is relatively cheap in japan  it 39 s a nice tipple but the price is going up and up personally i 39 ve been charmed by the glendronach single casks big beautiful sherry bombs sour vinegar for a sherry cask there is not much sweetness it smells like a household cleaner and the finish is bitter and sulfurous it 39 s gonna be a long time before i try another macallan product unless it 39 s free i don 39 t even know how i 39 m going to get through this bottle  i can 39 t say that macallan 12yr is the best because i don 39 t know it yet there are many more single malts yet to try but i can say from the many i have already tried i like the macallan 12yr too much and in my opinion it is wonderful from start to finish if the finish is not smooth enough for you drink water and save the great whiskey for me  i have tried many different brands and types of scotch macallan 12yr is the best  had a bottle on the shelf for a while as i wasn 39 t really drawn to it on first impression decided to go back pour a neat dram with an open mind and write about it after letting it sit i started getting some light brown sugar and pear skin on the nose underneath the floral and syrup notes that was quite enjoyable however i wasn 39 t too fond of the rough palate thankfully the finish notes of spiced muffins and fruitcake candies washed in and smoothed out the experience some have commented on the issues of aftertaste but all i experienced was reminiscent of sour cherries or cough syrup be that good or bad to anyone else  i have been drinking macallan 18 and12 for a long time and i am not impressed by the new marketing strategy how is it possible for a whiskey maker to tell all of its long term customers that they will now change all of their product so they can serve more bottles of a totally different drink they obviously do not give a hoot about their customers i for one will not buy another bottle of macallan until they bring back the product that i want to drink and not the one that they want me to drink  yes might be slightly overrated but it is still a good and solid one and it all depends on the price i got my last bottle for 65 which is more than fair prices vary enormously from country to country if available at all but be warned some might find an aftertaste as described in other reviews my personal explanation and i might be wrong is that european oak is used and not american oak which has simply a different taste and has an impact on the whiskey if you can live with that and love the taste 5 stars if the aftertaste is too harsh 3 stars  it 39 s good but too expensive for the basic taste smooth for a young single malt  this is probably the best scotch i have had i am very disappointed that this scotch is being discontinued in north america the balvenie 12 double matured is very close but still not nearly as good  this is my first sherry cask and not at all what i expected it s good but not exceptional it s about 95 after tax at my local store a whiskey trying to be cognac  to my us mates buy buy buy this is one of the last single malts made in the highlands that is done right on every level it s a main stay in my bar and i but at least a bottle a month to ensure it will be here for as long as possible in my private reserves in my mind this is the single best scotch in the world  personally i d go glendronach 12 every day over this one  stood the test of time not sure why they showed as discontinued it is the best single malt compared with many such as 12 year glen morangie both sheery and rum casked they have fancy name lkee la santa and quinta ruben which are greta too but no cigar 12 year belvanie sherri and rum casked 15 year glen livet 12 year dalmore 17 year belvani all of these were tasted side by side just to be sure there you have it the best single malt so far anyone knows anything better than this pleas post just a note i normally like good tasting cogniac single malt world is new to me  best tasting single malt i ever tasted period starts of with sweet apple with constant sherry notes with dominant oak all around simple breath taking  i am used to peated whisky this is my second sherry whisky and i am proud of buying this well the finish with apple is something different for me i think that this will be my start of exploring sherry whiskies  this is my first single i was introduced to as a kid in aberdeenshire and it is still my favourite from memories to simple but amazing this is one drink that you can truly appreciate  blah blah blah i m drunk on this right now  agree regarding the sulfur sulphur aftertaste for the same price or less a lagavulin is much better value the macallan 12 year sherry oak is one of my favorites i used to stick to the balvenie 15yr single barrel triple cask 12yr etc but decided to give the macallan a try i was not disappointed it s a very nice single malt whisky i will be buying another bottle of the 12yr sherry oak among others from the macallan  and whisky is called whisky not scotch  i ve never understood it s popularity it s got a tight bitter aftertaste or taste even just about pleasantly offset with some honeyed sweetness drinkable but not my first choice  macallan 12 year old a great scot  being a yank of scot extraction i have a fondness for all things caledonian like tartans each whiskey has its distinctive hue and character to compare them is like comparing women they have their own individual charm the 12 yo is no different it stands on its own and is what it is i like it and will drink more of it the negative reviews strike me as blend drinkers they drink bass ale and think it all ale should be the same sulfur sulphur maybe i am not sophisticated enough to notice but as a brewer of beer i would notice it i did not  i have been seriously drinking scotch now for about 5 years so a mere novice in those 5 short years i have found not one dram to dislike i have been introduced to several producers each different but non did i dislike each has it s own qualities and personalities but as an everyday day drink the 12 year old macallan to my taste is ideal stop being uyoa up your own arse and enjoy the bloody stuff  the second review from the top is a jackass but this scotch is not in america we spell it sulfur not sulphur so take your snobbery elsewhere there were in fact notes of sulfur kind of a burning rotten eggs taste in the first glass i had from the bottom of a bottle but upon giving it a second chance for free thanks to my favorite barkeep i was pleasantly surprised the skunky sulfur notes were replaced with smokey peat notes but on to the scotch it s not bad but i was not blown away it is a fine drink of its own right but it lacks the flavor complexity and intensity that merits a higher rating it is the terry redlin of scotch a fine artist but nothing worth raving about  well all the bourgeois yahoo reviews apart i still love this 12 year old macallan amp that is just all   quot sulfur quot is actually correct  have enjoyed highland scotch macallan for over 20yrs and all others that i ve tried including those from the isle in my opinion can not compare to the pure enjoying satisfaction of macallan what you get from the sherry cask is what makes macallan what it is have enjoyed the 12 18 and 25yr and can say without a doubt the older the vintage the better this is one scotch that i felt was ahead of all others the satisfaction i get from this is top notch others have noted a dis satisfaction on the macallan taste in recent times and i would have to agree there is something lacking from years before that i can t put a finger on i can only pray that macallan is not allowing the best cask to be sent to asia china instead to those who would truly enjoy and appreciate the time and quality that makes macallan a scotch when mention one eyes to get wide with acknowledgment i for one would be sadden if macallan allowed it s profits to over rule it s quality with that i suggest those to try the cask strenght macallan if you can still find it hears hoping quality out weighs quantity three fingers one cube  i m new to the single malt scene i m finding my palate more suited to non prated speysiders at this point i like the sherry nose and finish and have had satisfactory experiences with balvenie 12 doublewood glenfiddich malt masters edition and aberlour abunadh i just tried a dram of the macallan 12 at a local pub and was glad i did not spring for a bottle it had an odd off puting element that was diminished with the addition of water but never quite went away  i suspect that may of quot all those who say it is over rated quot do know about whisky the fact that celebrities drink this says more about marketing than anything else it s a perfectly ok whisky no quot e quot thanks since this is scotland but it is a shadow of the 90s bottles and too often is slightly sulfured if you get a bottle that s been open a bit the sulfur may have blown off and it s then quite palatable for serious traditional sherry cask go for glendronach if you have vintage bottles save them so that one day you can show newbies how mac used to taste  always a pleasure to have a macallan i have been drinking ths single malt for 5 years all those who say it is over rated don t kow much about whiskey or its history or the fine people including celebrities that have it as one of their favourates i happen to enjoy the likes of tslisker glenlivit dalwhinie etc to new comers this is it in the world of the blessed waters  i got spiced maple sugar for the nose and a touch of wood on the palate overall i d say it s light and sweet with less body than the mom speyside single malt certainly drinkable but not my first choice  i so wanted to like this but it s just a weak whiskey that becomes watery after a few minutes it has a decent nose but more then that as a malt whiskey it s sub mediocre could go even as far as saying it s bad  in the palate and the finish there is some late bitterness which indicates that at least slightly sulphured cask have been used not the best sherried malts from macallan the fine oak 12 yo is considerable better although less sherried than this one  i ve not even opened my bottle of 12 y o macallan yet but i wanted to comment on the absolutely superb quality of the packaging used to protect my first order on its journey from master of malt s cellars having worked in the packaging industry for 38 years i ve never before come across the inflatable sleeve protecting the precious amber nectar brilliant thank you with that and your keen pricing you ve guaranteed my repeat business  i hate suphured whiskies unfortunately i have some but i really like this one maybe there is a very very little hint but it s way below the line by the way sulphur in uk sulfur in us see wikipedia from hungary it is the best in class always been the same great  competitor adverse opinion is a shinning star it is fantastic in the sherry class one of the five best this macallan deliver the very most to me mn in sweden  can tell you the macallan 12 fine oak is brilliant shameful if this one is sulfered but maybe that was just the 2009 2010 bottlings here s hoping this is a superbly balanced malt if the above reviewer cannot spell sulphur then how can he hope to taste it  doesnt deserve its global popularity unpleasant sulfur notes are prominent low scores in jim murray s whisky bible reflect the poor quality of this product 
1948.0, on a whim i asked the bar keep for the best scotch he had i loved it over ice this time and with a great steak sure i 39 ve had world champ such as the suntory yamazaki but this dalmore is just as pleasing  if you tried the 12 year old then you should know what to expect from this one less sherry and more smoke the age really adds a nice depth of flavour and it 39 s still smooth as ever i bough this after seeing many good reviews but i can say that i do not like it one bit smells lovely and the bottle is stunning but those are its only redeeming qualities in my eyes harsh very very bitter oily orange any chocolate and spice notes are hidden due to how bitter it is my second dalmore tried the cigar malt and is the second i disliked so i think i just do not like their whisky so much bitter feels like drinking perfume not a single malt for sure if you intend to mixer and want a nifty bottle then fine but i would say spend that 163 66 on something else that is drinkable if you intend to sip because i don 39 t see how they can class this as a premium whisky it is all marketing hype due to the lovely bottle designer whisky you are paying for the peter stag head and not decent contents don 39 t let the look of the bottle fool you into thinking this is anything but a vile whiskey the most bitter whiskey i have tried to date  dalmore 15 on the nose woody note sweetness floral honey note dark fruity note sherry maple slight bourbon cherry note chocolate liquorice marzipan palate sweetness dark fruit slight citrus orange spice chocolate woody note hickory malty this has become my new fave tantalizing orange peel and dark chocolate notes remained til the end with a silky finish  it s my first time with this whisky so i may need to come back to it another day first impression is that s it s a lovely colour so it should have a nice deep taste to match on the nose it was pleasant and i could pick out the a range of notes the palette told me the fudge flavour was still there then it disappeared instantaneously no aftertaste no volume no burn it s almost as if it s been watered down maybe it s designed to be drunk with snacks such as nuts or chocolate pretzels definitely not 1 star though as our us friends suggest your bottle is more likely to take a longer journey if you get me  a really well balanced single malt whisky what could go wrong when sherry and whisky come together add a little dark chocolate as part of the drinking experience  one of my favourite whiskies rich and deep with flavours of chocolate and orange can 39 t help returning to the bottle time and again  one of those easy drinking whiskies great nose and really smooth smells and tastes just like christmas cake yummy  nose unhappy sherry some orange 160 palate the initial palate is anorexic it fades into the whiskey 39 s moment of substance a harsh wooded sherry after hello echo echo echo  im not an expert but know what i like and the 15 year old is delicious for someone to say they poured it down the sink well each to their own for me its one of the best i have tasted so far supper the nose is similar to the macallan 12 sherry cask just lighter and not quite so sulphurous it hints at being a rich flavorful whisky but i was sorely disappointed very very light and far too subtle for subtle read 39 weak 39 sadly a really dull and disappointing whiskey especially for this level  this 15 is a fair bit drier and more quot sour quot if thats the word than most sherrywood whiskies initial taste after a glengoyne was quot im not keen on this quot but after a whle i got to like its character aniseed and bitter dark chocolate are at back of the slight sourness which was accentuated by the sweeter palate of the goyne alas i feel it needs to be a little stronger to do it justice 40 just doesn 39 t hit the mark after saying that its an interesting and enjoyable dram which i think will grow on me struth so harsh not smooth at all and gets worse after each glass poured it down the sink after the third glass horrible never again  i can believe the difference in tastes here the dalmore is a very different whisky it has a curious liquorice anise tang to it a bit between a speyside and an islay it is a great part of the whisky journey and i loved it  this is one of the worst scotches that i ve ever had i got it as a gift from duty free it s been in my bar for a few years and i had one drink left so i finished off the bottle there is a bad aftertaste and the notes on the pallet do not taste well together will never buy or drink dalmore again beautiful from the first mouthful until the last can 39 t believe the love hate reviews are we tasting the same single malt i personally loved the mellow flavours and finish  very soft on the palette definitely get fruitcake and sherry on the nose chocolate and curacao on the palate with a soft lingering smokey espresso expected more intensity for the money but not disappointed in the product however i feel it is over priced  never again will i buy a dalmore maybe i hit a bad batch but what i just opened cant be what the guys drank who gave 5 stars the best we tried so far overc30 years beautifully rich and smooth dram with a chocolate tasting finish couldn t recommend enough it was so bad i couldn 39 t finish it took two zips and couldn 39 t take a third had to pour the rest down the sink the only other whisky that was as bad was a 20 bucks bottle from the discounter  one of the worst drinks i ever had nothing compares this is a 3 100 the quot next worse quot was a jack daniels scoring a solid 30 100 on my personal scale better spend it on an aberlour if you want caramel and dark fruits i bought this for myself one year and loved it every year since my partner has bought me a bottle and it does not last very long i have no idea what everyone else is complaining about to me it is superb my go to whisky for every occasion  good whisky you can actually taste the different flavours and smell different aromas good job dalmore good job  this whisky holds what vodka promises you tastes ok and has no taste well seriously i 39 ve come to love whisky for its nose ane complex flavour from smokey laphroaigs to sweet dalwhinnies i 39 ve come to appreciate the different styles of uk 39 s whisky art but this one is something i never tasted and hopefully never will taste again boring in the nose a slight wiff of dark fruits and something else i cant yet define it reminded me of wet paper the taste was slightly sweet toffee or choclate vanishing into a non existing after taste within seconds the pro was i didn 39 t have a single bit of burn from alcohol if you ever drank a glenfidditch aberlour or any other good whisky imagine its complexity and strength in taste and aroma reduced to maybe 5 10 and the dalmore is what you get cheers  if you re looking for a smooth whisky which has a good brand behind it then this might be for you however if you re looking for a whisky that is stimulating and exciting then avoid at all costs it s watery and severely lacking in flavour at 40 and chill filtered what makes it worse is that there are some nice sherry notes muffled in the background which makes you feel like they took good whisky out of the casks and then ruined it during the bottling process it s a bit like listening to your favourite music through a well soundproofed door this whisky just makes me sad it s like they chill filtered the heart and soul out of it and i feel like almost anything from 163 30 and up will decimate this in a head to head my advice would be to buy glendronach 12 or benriach 10 or benromach 15 if you want sherry cask whisky and you can save yourself some money and disappointment  superb i agree with many other reviewers there is something very wrong with dalmore 15 they should recall it and reimburse customers  stay away i bought 2 bottels of this and this is hands down the number 2 worst bottel i hade ever tryed secound only to ledaig 10 the smell is like very old paper from an old book a little bit of mold an some wet wood on the palet you get cold cleanlng soap water andold glue  given as a gift to be honest i was hesitate to get excited because it has a so so reputation i tried it and can say i really enjoy it can see myself sipping on it for a while not a top 10 whisky but there are some really interesting notes would recommend quot try before you buy quot but delightful little gift  do not listen to any of these tossers who are saying this is a weak dram outstanding nose and body won 39 t find better for the money  40 you ve got to be kidding me  very rich honey and chocolate in a sherry cask but not one i can drink all night 2 is enough not a great whisky at all i ve tried to give this whisky time to open up but every time i go back to it there s no real improvement a couple of drops of water helps slightly but at only 40 you don t want to add to much or you end up with weak swill it s just slightly fusty slightly sweet simple whisky certainly not worth the price when you could have a glenfarclas 15 glenmorangie 12 quinta ruban or the like for cheaper than this avoid  nose round honey chocolate orange rosewater palate juicy tropical fruits slight herbalfinish warm a bit of smoke malt i received my first bottle of dalmore 15 as a christmas present this past year the bottle is most attractive but the attraction ends there the scotch smells bad and tastes bad it seems some others have the same reaction just wondering if there was a bad batch  excellent beginner whiskey for those who want something rich in flavour but quite gentle notes of delicious fruit cake and a mellow warming finish  great had the whole bottle could not walk for 2 days really smooth warming whisky good value for money brought a bottle as had tried it at a whiskey festival a full bottle did not disappoint or last long at all well worth every penny so so smooth divine you say it s expensive yes but the price is yet to come  smooth and balanced delivers dark chocolate orange and a hint of ginger on the palate bought a bootleg after a tasting last christmas and have just bought another my current favourite  i never liked scotch until i tasted this it is very smooth and does not leave a burning after taste i highly recommend  outstanding a real treat of smooth balanced flavour i love this 129303  nose a strong marmiade sent tiny amount of peat rasins almonds brown sugar overall very inviteful mouth tiny hints of liqorish and plums and a lasting cinnamon taste but everything is nulled by a weak watery taste overall disapointing finish it 39 s there with just the slightest sherry influence at the back of the throut and a warm feel that ligures but it could be so much better overall unsatisfying if you want a dalmore in your collection stick with the cheaper 12 its less of a blow the low apv hinders what could make this a great whiskey good but it could be so much better  smooth notes of chocolate peppermint fruit butterscotch caramel dalmore to me seem to put all the emphasis on creating a premium brand rather than creating good whisky this is chill filtered colourant added and bottled at the minimum legal strength in the uk of 40 but sold at quite a premium price in a very flashy bottle it 39 s a rather uninspiring whisky good for a starter who wants to look sophisticated it 39 s warming plenty of dried fruit notes the finish is over quickly not very complex at all there are better sherries whiskies out there for the price imo  i was reluctant to try this one given the ridiculous prices here in the states it is however the most palatable whisky i 39 ve ever had i hesitate to use the word 39 smooth 39 in a compliment but it is yet somehow it retains a strong flavor profile and complexity it is sweet and somewhat dry many of the descriptors seem accurate there 39 s no mistaking it as a sherried whisky i consider this a bargain price on mom but would likely never pay the average price i find locally get a bottle but don 39 t pay too much  what an amazing drink i was bought it for my birthday i was blown away with how easy on the palate it is and what a finish it 39 s better than the 18yr old and that 39 s a good dram for me this was a real tasting adventure at the beginning i was not impressed all to sweet for me after a while i discovered new flavours and a rich body full of different spicy flavours i mostly drink islay and campbeltown so this was a real good surprise for me just give it a little time and try to learn to know this whiskey bought a bottle two years ago and it was a treasure complex and sweet with a spicy side and notes of fruit christmas cake and chocolate the bottle i bought today is hands down awful weird wood flavors and no complexities or savory flavors just eww how sad  awful the nose is pretty good chocolate orange with a subtle note of fruitcake palate is medium with a nice finish for the price i think it 39 s reasonable  read a lot of positive reviews for this one however i 39 m a bit dissapointed on the nose i got a slight whiff of chocolate then alcohol that 39 s it the taste was very smooth but not very complex no burn very easy to drink neat i would say it 39 s good for someone who 39 s never had whisky before but for the price it 39 s not complex enough  very disappointed with this one fantastic packaging but you can 39 t drink that beautifully presented colour wise that 39 s all the good bits out of the way totally lacking anything like a complex nose just a whiff of caramel taste barely exists slight caramel taste then alcohol burn there is absolutely nothing to like about this just feel sorry for the spirit being locked away in a barrel for 15 years  my wife and i tried this one she is not a big scotch drinker but instantly picked up on the sweetness of it had a very nice finish too with to me a citrusy taste we both liked this one  we do a fair bit of tasting but are from being any sort of experts we just knew what we like this is one that we sampled at christmas 2015 amongst others and it turned out to be our favourite of the night we just sampled another 7 tonight and the dalmore once again came out on top of the lot we tried the others varying from 163 40 80 a bottle shame to read that there have been bad batches but i 39 d give it a chance and will be buying a bottle soon it 39 ll sit very nicely in the collection and have a place of its own  hats off to the guys at dalmore prob the best 15yo for the money  i will not shy away from saying that i am a novice reviewer and that my entry into the world of whisky appreciation has only just begun yet this is such a delightful drop that i wanted to convey my thoughts i started some months ago aided and abetted by my wife into a whisky journey starting with simple single malts of tender years and working our way outwards to singles of greater years a simple plan born out of an attempt to train our palettes and appreciation first before moving on to the more complex territory of blended malts and even older years the dalmore found its way to my door following a 12 year old auchentoshan triple distilled and despite my fondness for the smoothness and depth of the former the dalmore was something else altogether the auchentoshan almost felt thin by comparison such is the richness and fruit packed nature of this perfectly balanced whisky not overly sweet it has a pure vanilla and honey fragrance backed up with cherry cinnamon sticky marmalade and the faintest of smoke finishes that is absolutely superb smooth yet characterful complex yet rounded this is something i will look forward to drinking again and would recommend that you seek it out now to track down a bottle of dalmore 39 s king alexander iii  well for the age and money probably one of my first choices out of any whiskey on the market also one of my first choices out of the dalmore range expect quality and rich wonderful flavors such as christmas cake raisins dark cherries cinnamon and nutmeg the smell is easy because it smells like christmas yum if your new to this whiskey and don 39 t like it well you wont like whiskey at all so dont bother writing a review dalmore it worth every penny this particular one beats a lot of 18 year old whiskies in every shape and form dalmore never really fluctuates in flavor as it is something i can rely on as a mouthwatering whiskey ooh yeah fifth bottle in  apparently judging by the negative reviews i am lucky to have bought one of a good batch holy crap this is amazing got introduced to the dalmore with the 12 and reading about the 15 got me intrigued and i am very glad i bought this bottle today  i 39 ve had a couple of bottles of this over the last couple of years and actually ranked it as my favourite whisky with its sweet caramel flavour and it 39 s smooth finish however i received a bottle this christmas as a present and it is bad the sweetness has all but disappeared along with the smoothness this batch should have been rebranded as something else as it certainly isn 39 t the dalmore 15 i have come to know and love the problem now is do i ever buy a bottle of this again at 163 50 163 60 a bottle if there is a chance it 39 s going to be the same as this  good taste very smooth chocolate taste goes very well with indian spicy food  after seeing how hit and miss this dram appears to be with the audience must be quality control on here i was glad to find i must have got a good batch red apple and ginger with maybe a hint of treacle in there somewheresmooth finish with a peppery hit received as a gift and think it one of the best malts i have tasted if i could afford to i would drink it all the time very smooth and no after burn like some malts most enjoyable  bought a bottle from dfs after reading rave reviews on this sherry monster however like some other folks here the bottling i have is just horrible i agree with quot caramel flavoured fire water quot no complexity and a touch of sweetness caramel on the nose then the alcohol burn i don 39 t know what to do with the rest of the bottle  first time trying this decent start with sweet sherry but lacking in a robust after taste will use this as a starter if in aa drinking a chain of other whiskies recommended for light tasting cuisines like chinese but not on its own  i always add a touch of water to my whiskey the dalmore lends itself to this i found it smooth to the tongue with a peppery finish i especially enjoyed holding it in my mouth and allowing the flavors to build as for the price i think all scotch whiskey is over priced but that is life  i have had dalmore 15 a few times sometimes it is awesome and then the next bottle is meh i really wish i knew how to pick the good bottle ahead of time this bottle was great first sniff quot ooh is that some butterscotch quot a bit of resin but a good round nose add a drop of water and the umami comes right out doubling down on that butterscotch it was great i almost want to ask if there is a chance the wrong scotch was put into the dram bottle with a sipping it some nice honey butterscotch notes a good orange tartness and it filled the mouth with a great round warm feeling aftertaste was good too left me with just the right amount of happiness and the saltiness i attributed to the butterscotch flavor lingers well done if it was consistently like this i would buy a bottle and then worry about drinking it too fast final note i am doing the 2015 advent calendar as a result i get one drink at it to decide if i like it enough to buy more sometimes i need to drink something three or four times to make up my mind thus my rating is based on a one time drink experience  this was the first dram of the advent calendar we just received as a christmas gift a fine way to start 24 tastings i never understand reviews that talk about this flavor or that flavor i just know what i like and i liked this dalmore expression very much i 39 ve had dalmore before and this is a worthy addition to those i 39 ve tasted earlier  i guess i got lucky judging by the posts complaining about quality issues this was absolutely brilliant very smooth very nice i could drink it all year long  very nice mellow nice nose easy to drink  first let me say i 39 m a relative newbie trying to learn about scotch my tastes are developing and not sophisticated my favorites to date are glenmorrangie quinta ruban and glendronach parliament 21 so you know my flavor bias i put together a non peaty advent calendar to try new things and this dalmore 15 is day one i 39 ve always admired the bottles with their silver stag ornament romantic i was heartened by the smell which was warm and toffee ish but with a hint of fire in the back the taste however was sharp acrid and very much in contrast to the nose burnt going down next added a few drops of water which made the initial taste smoother and more palatable but then it turned into something kind of like acidic vegetables and still burned like crazy when i swallowed not for me from some of the other comments it seems possible that this label might be inconsistent i may give it a try again but not eagerly  i confirm what previous reviewers are saying something has gone very wrong with this whisky  the mixed reviews here are understandable once you 39 ve opened and then had 3 4 drams over a period i was bought a bottle as a present and the nose is very inviting lots of toffee and chocolate orange with a sherry backdrop the problem is the palate and lasting taste which is not smooth leaving a taste of wood and alcohol after 3 4 attempts i have found it much smoother and pleasant mixed with tepid water leaving less of a burnt taste wood coffee  got a bottle of this from duty free hoping for a decent sip after which i don 39 t know what to do with the rest of the litre there 39 s some taste of bad wood and very stinging alcohol and that 39 s the end of it nowadays i may take a sip of this just a few tiny drops then move on to some proper drink and behold instantly you tell how good the other one is the magic works every time even for cheap blends like the red label  just opened another bottle of this stuff and it 39 s definitely not the same as i had a month ago so i agree with other unlucky guys here there 39 s definitely something wrong with quality control  bought this bottle several months back and brought with me on vacation caramel flavored firewater nails it given the positive reviews i 39 ve read on this scotch i was excited now after opening i am quite disappointed no complexity just an alcohol burn does this distillery have quality control issues i believe those who rated this highly i just do not think those folks tasted what i just opened i had some of this at a tasting a couple of years ago and it was by far the best of the whiskies i tasted the bottle i 39 ve just had delivered is definitely not the same stuff i think the best description i can come up with is quot caramel flavoured firewater quot it 39 s tedious slightly sweetened one dimensional there 39 s little on the nose and the palate gives you nothing but a lingering sense of ethyl alcohol i 39 m very disappointed and i suspect that there 39 s either some major quality control issues or somewhere along the line there 39 s been some shenanigans  unique has a slightly cloying flavor i guess it 39 s the orange chocolate i 39 m not crazy for but it 39 s deep complex rich and obviously well made a little seaweed saltiness would help balance the orange chocolate and sweetness for me close to being one of the best ever in my book  i am usually a peaty filled whiskey lover laph or lag any day but knowing what to expect before trying this marvel made for a wonderful experience nose i could keep it in the glass all day one of more pleasant to breathe in it has such a smooth feel and end compared to others that are of the same family this is very hard to beat wonderful  i have met a few from the dalmore family and this one has not let me down let it breath a while for it to deliver its full aroma the taste is not overly complex and really opens up with a splash of water does not beat the 18 year old but comes close i was quite pleased with this reasonably priced single malt  overpriced overhyped maybe i hit a bad batch who knows would definitely benefit from higher abv and no chill filtering got most of the classic dalmore notes oranges chocolate leather oak ash all very flat though finish is just leather ash and a nasty burn i 39 d be pissed off at paying 163 25 for this i payed 163 44  definitely a poperi smell sherry presence malted barley x mas fruit cake orange body lemon cough drops smooth finish light dryness enjoyed more than the king alexander iii but still favor dalmore 18yr  the nose is very unique and very pleasant i spent a few minutes nosing the glass and thought for sure i was in for a great whisky experience until i took a drink the palate flattens out and does not follow up well with the nose and really lacked the distinct original flavour that the nose hinted at not terrible but very disappointing nice warming finish though if i had paid 60 70 for this bottle i would have been okay with it but for the 114 bc liquor stores in canada i feel it is very over priced  ahhh dalmore always a favorite after previously trying the 12 and 18 year old versions but can the 15 year old live up to this high standards nose soft with chocolate hints smells very inviting indeed taste rich strong flavour with the orange fruit hints which is expected from the dalmore range with a smooth yet warming finish which lingers a little overall very nice and delicious as expected from the dalmore family it 39 s one of those which gives you what you expect a very nice whisky with a rich and smooth taste very hard to beat for what it costs  right on the nose not fantastic straight out of the bottle but it opens up after a while to really reveal that fullbodied winter spicy taste the taste ends a little to quickly though so one needs to keep sipping  nose toffee vanilla orange cocoa powder floral notes some smoke and notes of cream sherry palate viscous and chewy on the palate with notes of burnt toffee and mandarins cream sherry and hints of smoke finish a long finish with notes of spiced orange malt and almonds  another christmassy choice for the advent calendar heavily orange nose with a little oak spicy start with cloves and allspice that turns floral with more air orange flavours dominate but a touch of water brings out some smoke and toastiness it 39 s a very smooth whisky not very challenging perhaps but easy going and pleasing enough  i have not tried this before 2008 but i do enjoy the quot new quot one i get a lot of red apples and ginger nice sherry and spice notes and a drying finish really want the cigar malt now cm this used to be one of the best whiskies in the world but after 2008 it turned into a cheap caramel colored alcoholic beverage which is good only for windscreen washing tank every illegal gypsy distillery in bulgaria produces better stuff so mister richard paterson go ahead continue embarrassing yourself acting clown in idiotic tv shows and expect somebody to buy your crap  high grade scotch very smooth yet flavorful sweet and savory with lots of interesting features highly recommended for a relaxing night  simply delicious the notes of chocolate orange and a subtle hint of winter spice are clearly present  i was lucky enought to be given a glass of this whiskey last night and it was a real treat i found the aroma to be quite spicey though not overly so despite my heavy cold on the palette i loved the ginger that came through something to savour but not for too long as it can take over taste it right and it does give just enough warmth the finish though short was pleasant it didn t giveme that pleasant warm me through on a freezing cold night feeling but i was at least a warming hug i enjoyed the complexity of this whiskey it kept me interested for the evening it was easy to drink and great to share  great for relaxing with a friend and forgetting your troubles this is a beautiful whisky to lift your mood and give you a warm glow i love it  i m getting a touch of maple syrup on the left nostril here  i m fairly new to whisky only been drinking it for about 18 months and have gotten to try a fair few as i tend to try something new with each purchase i don t get all the subtle notes of this and that but it s just a delicious deep and articulate i have only tried a handful of 15yr singles but this is by far my favourite so far and i think this will be my go to whisky from now on got a bottle in the post after a sample came a few weeks ago will enjoy mine tonight  the 12 yr old version of the dalmore might appear to beat this one straight out of the gate but give it a few minutes and you ll observe the tightly packed rich flavours amp scents begin to peel out gently and assault your mouth with a fullness and great taste that ends quickly making you take successive sips to rekindle the moments needless to say i finished my suppliers stock of this and the 12yr old  i have tasted a bottle of dalmore whiskey amp i loved it scent of a woman like their perfume it needs respect and time to savour what a creamy fantastic sweet complex dram my friends this is what scotch whisky is all about ed victoria bc let me give some advice without being an elitist if you don t understand or you re a little illiterate in nosing or even appreciating what scotch is all about don t review a product base on your taste bud that is train for bell or a cheap bottle of bourbon i am no expert but what one thing learned about life is to appreciate and respect the things that other people love so do all of us a favour go review the products that you like with respect and a little bit of intelligence ok now get out of the room ed victoria bc let me give some advice without being an elitist if you don t understand or you re a little illiterate in nosing or even appreciating what scotch is all about don t review a product base on your taste bud that is train for bell or a cheap bottle of bourbon i am no expert but what one thing learned about life is to appreciate and respect the things that other people love so do all of us a favour go review the products that you like with respect and a little bit of intelligence ok now get out of the room  nice dram sweet and with zests of orange as others have said sweet smell and smooth taste but no finish calling it a beginners malt sounds slightly patronising but i do agree with this theory scent of a woman like their perfume it needs respect and time to savour what a creamy fantastic sweet complex dram my friends this is what scotch whisky is all about  very nice whiskey and i very rarely drink loved bottle design kids wanted the silver stag on bottle but broke it getting it off  nice nose nice original taste and then nothing great beginner dram  friend of mine had brought this dalmore from germany we five of us had the drink for the first time it is smooth and enjoyed till the last drop we recommend this one and shall have it next time  aroma raisins oak orange liqueur palate nuts chocolate spices orange peel and cinnamon finish wood oranges with spices bit chalk and chocolate comments pleasant drinkable but lacks power cause of strength not for my taste  i have tasted a lot of single malt whiskies on my way back from holland i decided to buy this dalmore 15 and what a buy one of the nicest single malts i have tasted surely i recommend this one  friend of mine bought it for me for a gift knew i was a bourbon only drinker so good i was shocked can t keep it in the house all my friends develop excuses to come over so they can drink it very smooth minimal peat great finish plays well in a crowd no one i know has turned it down i m a laphroaig single malt drinker and am used to a heavily peated scotch my experience with the dalmore was then surprising as the flavour was not as intense but the smooth clean and easy finish made this a very pleasant drop enjoyed next to a log fire outdoors in winter nice orange taste smooth and mellow aftertaste still find it hard to beat this dram my number 1 picked this on up on a whim on my way back from abu dubai after area bottles of jacks silver select and chivas regals simply outstanding a nice medium finish with notes of orange and choclate only problem is its to nice 3rd bottle in 9 months poor wallet but very happy nose and pallet better than the king alexander iii imo  i must say that 70 for this bottle is much cheaper than i ve seen it priced elsewhere however i was quite disappointed by the dalmore 15 it tastes like swill to me the caramel flavoring agent is overpowering and the scotch is two dimensional and disappointing  first delving into dalmore and can t get enough of this flavorful scotch chocalately fruity and bursting with flavor awesome nose and wonderful finish grab a bottle i m off to check out the other expressions soon  i have tasted dalmore 15 for the first time and i am not a scotch drinkerbut this is some good shit i love it  i bought a bottle of this for christmas and am very very pleased extremely smooth nice velvet feel in the mouth with a very pleasent after taste  this bottle played excellently to a crowd with a pallet running from kentucky burbon only drinkers to the most choosy of scotch drinkers something not easily accomplished  a firm favourite of mine you just want to roll it around in your mouth and savour all the little tastes that steadily reveal themselvesa beautifully velvety balanced and enjoyable drink  i have tasted a bottle of dalmore whiskey i loved it i m not a scotch drinker yet i decided to explore my pallet this holiday season actually the only time i have tried it was the day we buried my father 12 years ago so in honor of him i will try the delmore 15 he would probably prefer the king alexander but i will start here  teachers and office workers stick to teachers or bells or if you feel like splashing out buy a bottle of grouse prrrrrrrp  love this dram tried it for the first time last summer and was blown away with the deep dark chocolate taste and burstly with winter spice this malt is one of my favorites from the last 12 months well done dalmore nicolawhiskyboys i initially bought this as it just looked really delicious and it is i usually go for the smoky peaty styles but bought this as a change it s very smooth and for a change i noticed some of the flavours mentioned in the tasting notes well worth a try  太好喝啦 it s good whisky i drink a bottle per month i recommend  some malts are made to sip over a long period and this is one of them a nose of orange sherry leads to a syrupy taste which lingers most pleasantly dalmore consistently provides quality malts  i don t understand why this bottle has a stag on it the contents do not taste like stag at all i bought this really under false pretences it tastes just like a whisky it is not a good drink for teachers or office workers 
1927.0, the abv is perfect to bring the aromas out from this whisky with its thick taste and the light oily texture nose orange peels dark berries a little bit of the so called earthiness some sea breeze but i can 39 t find any smoke in oban 14 for example i can find a discreet smoke but not in this one the orange peels and the earthiness reminds me about talisker on the palate i can find a kind of weak smoke some oak sweetness shy caramel yes a quite long bitter sweetness at the finish and it 39 s peppery not oaky i think a good whisky and a very good whisky for its price level i thin one has to try a few glasses of this whisky before giving it any stars very good and very good for its price like it  packed with flavour with a slight white pepper nip which refreshes the palate taste lingers without being overly oily  one of the best in similar price band visited this distillery in 2019  holy alliance of beeswax orange peel and briny sea air very intense very unique very tasty  what a superb complex and fascinating flavour profiled whisky this is  fine  it is about the best i ever tasted where it differs from others is peaty but not too smokey you might like to know this comment is from a female sorry you can send any to the us nicola tuath glass shows chestnut oloroso sherry the nose shows a lot of rich citrus and vanilla the palate is vanilla forward with a light backbone of citrus with hints of honey and just a whisper of smoke moderate alcohol burn after 2 drops of water more oak and citrus excellent approachable light fruity bitter orange oil red apple the lightest touch of burnt sugar finish is raw cookie dough easy drinking well balanced complex enough to engage but not so demanding that you spend all evening nosing a single glass a good session whisky no idea where quot the chaps at master of malt quot are finding the peat maybe it 39 s all that smoke they 39 re blowing  not unlike a good irish whisky clynelish supplies a lot of single malt whisky to johnnie walker but this 14 year old single malt rewards the patient taster with a lovely sonata that develops engagingly over the course of an hour nose opens with a distinctive buckwheat honeycomb but as it breathes settles into a sweet quot waxy quot honeysuckle that matures into a delicate orange blossom taffy over time a sensitive nose might recognize larchwood from the backwash palate charming and seductive especially if tickled with a sliver of ice buckwheat honey black pepper and persimmon wood quot peat quot lovers will be disappointed but it 39 s no more than they deserve a good cuban cigar made the most of this outstanding spirit 39 s sweetness like a good cognac should be decanted for fullest experience will broaden the horizons of anyone with a real interest in exploring the complex world of whisky  great tasting better than my 12 year mccallen a superb malt a world beater at this price  wonderful malt from an excellent distillery visited a few years ago across the way brora still stands hauntingly beautiful  wonderful everything i like in a great scotch i recently purchased a bottle of clynelish 14 year old after reading several glittering reviews i was not disappointed this whisky has shot into my top 5 and is a steal for its age if you are a fan of old pulteney this is a must try  just tried this based on a ralfi review not dissatisfied but not quite as good as i expected also watched several other reviews and all mentioned a great balance of sweetness deep fruit caramel etc and the right balance of peat but i 39 m not noticing any peat at all reminds me more of a 12 yo bunnahabhain even with the addition of water it 39 s still not bringing up anything that interesting for the price 75 oo here in florida hoping it develops in the bottle as the oxygen works  one of my favourites really a great whisky complex and interesting for some reason it seems to have changed character a bit every time i come back to it but always very very good though the rich and full mouthfeel is simply amazing highly recommended  i absolutely love this as a previous poster said it did decline a little and there were a couple of patchy batches but it s back on form now in my opinion it puts some whiskies twice its price or more to shame  to me this tastes like a cherry liquor sweet but the cherry is too ripe and nearing rotten some acidity a little oak maybe some orange but just a flicker in the distance no peat at all of all the whiskies i tried maybe 30 or 40 at this point if i have to point my least favourite this would probably be it  i like this far too much we all have different tastes but in my opinion a great mid point whisky not as gentle as a typical speyside nor as big as a typical island offering well worth a try this is a fine single malt complex intense and full with a subtle dry finish on top of that it is uncoloured not filtered and bottled at 46 which is starting to be rare for a standard bottling for all these reasons i commend clynelish and support them with my purchases  in the last year i 39 ve started buying and trying differents malts going from glenfiddich 12 glenmorangie 10 caol ila 12 talisker 10 aberlour 12 double cask matured ardbeg 10 singleton of dufftown and this one clynelish 14 simply is the best one in my opinion is that good that after trying the first glass i had to buy another bottle for the future  very tasty dram after a few weeks of being opened the flavours developed beautifully to a smooth and distinctive character easy drinking and a perfect cracker for beginners  i 39 ve enjoyed this whisky for many years and opened up my new bottle last evening and loved every drop i really like the perfumy spicy finish which lingers long it 39 s smooth too even at 46 but a dribble of water sweetens it somewhat would be 5 stars if it were non chillfiltered and without the added colour  it misses out on the finish that is very short overall i like clynelish 14 but like so many other diageo brands it has been allowed to deteriorate and was much better 4 years ago quality quality quality that 39 s all we want  not overly impressed with this scotch i generally like a peatier flavor this whisky has an aftertaste that i can 39 t quite place almost like the taste left in one 39 s mouth after taking penicillin pills too waxy for me  i 39 m too drunk to describe best i can do is it 39 s similar to kilkerran 12 which is my favorite dram  a once truly wonderful experience has been in decline for the last few years the orchard fruits are there as is the spice but the last couple of bottles i have had have been a little hot and the waxiness has disappeared which used to be clynelish s signature perhaps i tried a bad batch or perhaps as the whisky has become more popular margins are being squeezed a good bottle is superb and i wish you all the best in locating them  up front peaty smoke with smooth even finish but slightly short oily back end delicious scotch great price point  oh wow am mostly in to sherry bombs but wanted something different and tried 14 and i must say i will always have a bottle hidden somewhere great for its price  the guy below who mentioned this being good for home made blends is bang on the money goes beautifully with aberlour a 39 bunadh i tried the same with bowmore 12 and it was a salty sherry mess this is a good whisky on its own but definitely lends itself well to blending ardbeg mix worked well too  plenty of taste and smell plus waxy oily coastal excellence in spades if only the finish were a bit longer it would be my no 1 whisky regardless of price and age at the moment  delicious high in degrees and delicate flavours  great bottle of whisky a very good easy drinking scotch that has great character traits  the second bottle and bought as a christmas dram absolute quality but ross will probably want a dash of coke in his  as im more of a bourbon drinker but wanted to buy a scotch was in scotland at the time i was pointed to this it does not disappoint sweet toffee to start then rounds into dried orange almost mincemeat y middle the finish is slightly smokey almost peppery and lingers nicely without being too savage this is one smooth cat 128521  my all time favorite non peated whisky rich and malty with a lovely salty note almost like a salted caramel absolutely delicious  it s all about the finish like the cat on the label for me it is a bit rough by that i mean it finishes a bit on the bitter side that being said it is only 14 so for the price it holds up well if you drink it neat you may want to look for something a tad more mature of course everyone s taste are unique so by all means have at her  waxy no other whisky quite like it as a single malt it 39 s 39 nice 39 but kinda monotonous but it is absolutely superb for adding to home made blends where it adds body fantastic length and a rounded mouthfeel try it with a splash of caol isla or ardbeg etc and you get a glass that is much better than either single malt on it 39 s own it is still very good but it does need something 39 more 39 to fill it out oh if you are a marketing stooge for diago they write most of the reviews here i suggest you talk about the picture of the wildcat on the label  ok people listen up this is a lovely whisky great mouthfeel what does that mean it means the opposite of watery it is thick in your mouth sweet smooth very similar to aberfeldy 18 and of course dewar 39 s 15 my kind of whisky sweet thick not smokey  fantastic stuff ima buy 6 more bottles to stash up  you honestly won 39 t get a better single malt for this price buy it now and enjoy  best unpeated yet this is a good one bought it 4 months ago but didn t fully appreciate it lovely flavours nice with a little water too really quite complex for a 14 yr old great value and truly wonderful flavours 128526  this isn 39 t chill filtered or if it is only very slightly clear scotch mist in the glass when you add water and give it time excellent whisky diageo have clearly seen that this isn 39 t a whisky to sell to the international market and more of a whisky connoisseur 39 s single malt and have made it a craft whisky 46 non chill filtered natural colour it is much improved on the bottle i had 5 years ago  punchy add some drops of water yet light fruity and slightly briney nicely oily and a whiff of smoke finish is too short given its palate for my taste at the current quality a cracking whisky and a bargain for what it is at 35 in nl keep it like this please or evolve it just slightly clynelish  for the below commenter whisky that compass box gets for their blends would come from if not in the cask and unaltered  are you sure this is chill filtered and coloured with caramel after adding water it turns cloudy suggesting it 39 s non chill filtered and the colour is a very pale golden yellow suggesting that no colour is added compass box use clynelish in their blends and they claim to never use whisky that is coloured or chill filtered either way it 39 s a very fine whisky for the money not too dissimilar to old pulteney 17 which i think is better but costs 163 30 more  sea salt citrus and light smoke a good dram overall i find it rather inoffensive all rather pleasant the nose has a strong alcohol hit with hints of orange this quickly develops into a pleasant waxiness coating the mouth is coastal saltiness which entinces the drinker to have one more sip the old rubbing a splash on the palm of your hand trick reveals next to no scent and i can understand why this is used as the base for johnny walker 39 s blends i do think this is a malt that lends itself to small splash of water to open up the flavours which leads to a warm creaminess on the palate definitely value for money at 163 37  one of the best 14 year old whiskies one can buy at a very reasonable price as well  been eyeing this for a while and finally decided to grab it needs a little water to cut the bite seems younger than it is but you get a really pronounced coconut in the finish when you do this pretty good overall but the finish is the best part  i cannot believe i 39 ve waited so long to try this whisky it has perfect balance and mouthfeel waxed leather orange peel and sugary orange butter cake soaked with cinnamon and scotch an absolute must try for all whisky lovers absolutely sublime smoke how on earth can they use this for blends when it is so perfect on its own  very enjoyable  this is a great 46 abv non chill filtered whisky very fresh when you get tired of sherried sweet whisky  very good 14 yo honey on the nose after a splash brought out the zesty bitterness flavour that lingers on your tongue  a very distinctive single malt sweet and heathery on the nose a bit of a salty taste to it and some definitely strong wood influence wax leather oaky bitterness and some tang but overall very pleasant because it is accommodated by the sweeter malt taste and adds complexity to that some flower and grapefruit like bitterness in the finish  surprised to be surprised this is very high quality  tasted it recently far better than it was a few years back when it became a speyside wannabe with a wretched perfumey stench on the nose i hope to see clyne returning to its farmy and smoky roots in the tradition of the old young broras i bought a 15 year exclusive cask from creative that was quite rugged farmy smoky and complex if the ob could even get half way back into that place then it would be worth the money for sure  this might be my new favorite coastal highland reminds me of oban 14 but slightly smokier and more coastal it 39 s not as smooth as oban but its stronger so for me that 39 s a plus and it just has more flavor than oban one of my new favorites for sure the sugarbear my all time favourite all time favourite despite me being a massive peat head this is so subtle and gentle you have to look for every single flavour which are a lot or you just cannot look at all and let the dram cuddle your senses waxy nose with zesty and marine notes a gentle arrival which developes in intrigued sensations of fruit bouquets and leathery notes the finish is an north highlands 39 typical with a lovely final hint of milk cream  bought this on a whim but most likely overpaid a bit at 63 u s the salty finish was something i didn 39 t anticipate and was surprised by how much i liked it a solid sweet and salty dram   oh wait i have to set down this delicious dram of clynelish 14 first from a neat pour the nose is slightly muddled at first the orange tang is most prominent with some salt and smoke and a hint of melted butter after it opened up i found more creamier notes like cr 232 me brulee and mixed berries and whipped cream the palate is beautiful light clean and delightfully delicate with soft oaky citrus notes that trail into a glorious finish of smoked salt and dark cocoa downside there is a faint soapiness in the palate but you really have to look for it a previous review stated color is added and it 39 s chill filtered perhaps this would make a more interesting dram if color wasn 39 t added and it was un chill filtered while i also like to see these statements on a bottle i 39 m drinking from i must admit it 39 s not turning me away from this clynelish  not bad to sweet but nice less sherry or no sherry just stick to bourbon barrels46 abv is perfect no bite or burn very good dram but could be made much betterno chill no color no sherry mature in first fill bourbon barrels for 15 yearsand you have a gem of a scotch steve g boston based scotch fanatic can 39 t you tell lol  stunning why you may ask brought in cambodia cheaper than tap water tastes like evian  let one ice cube melt in a generous tot then taste it and smell the mixture of aromas don t describe clynelish 14 year old whisky just enjoy it and pour another  this entry level clynelish holds its own in comparison to even the most fancy clynelishes i have tasted dozens of clynelishes and currently have a dozen open bottles of clynelish and yet i always return to the 14 yo with great pleasure  i really wanted something different and i am so glad i selected this scotch i love the salt and brine in the profile also i got some intermittent smoke and a great warmth fantastic  hard to place as it is a mix of so many lovely flavours and influences not as well known or celebrated as many brands but well worth investigating dry fruity and warming  an interesting nose in that you can pick out all sorts have a whiff and you get a note have another whiff and you find something else very complex on the nose on the palate i immediately get creaminess and a lovely mouth feel it s oily briney orange peel cedarwood and some kind of green ginger galangal thing going on too i did think the finish was pretty short though in comparison to say caol ila 12 and bunnahabain 12 both of which love clynelish 14 is quality stuff though and probably not one of the more immediate ones that jump out from the shelf well worth a go  my mother is a lover of certain types of alcohol especially malt whiskey my dad would drink anything that has a percentage but my mother is more refined she used to get bottles of whiskey from obscure places when my brother was working all over scotland so i needed to find a good one for their christmas present i noticed a regular comment about clynelish being the base of the green label hence the purchase and the seal of approval by my mother  at usd 50 it s an excellent value and a lucky selection among dozens of i never heard o that one bottles in a wilmington delaware wine shop now i m even more determined to taste every never heard of that one offering of distilled cold barley soup from north of the tweed well done so many distillers so little time  an excellent malt especially at this price upon trying this on a blind taste test i guessed it was highland and coastal and this is all assertained through the nose the taste is somewhat salty and i totally appreciate the leather comments but the flavours go on and on which is special in a 14 year old well balanced yet bold this is certainly a malt that you would price at 163 70 plus  reminds me of coriander not an easy whisky that some will love and some will hate it all evolves around that that one big taste on your pallet soap love it  really interesting and unusual this one marriage of highland and coast producing something fantastic and a really surprising joy nose citrus peel and leather candles and a briny peat palate clean and firm really rounded feel of citrus fruits oak and leather with that mandarin note really developing dry and bitter sweet with a hint of dark chocolate and mixed spice subtle hint of vanilla finish long and balanced gentle peat and salt spray with a real bitter sweet spiciness citrus flavours throughout mandarin readily apparent with soft leather and charred oak  the short answer should be no clynelish was only built in 1967 whilst brora which was originally called clynelish just to complicate matters dates back to the 19th century but is best known for its heavily peated output in the late 1960s and early 1970s that said you will rightly find similar tasting notes between many clynelish releases and bottlings of brora especially the less peated ones these will be citrus notes as well as coastal brine and even smoke so not a stupid question at all the chaps at master of malt i ll ask anyway much is made of the proximity of the clynelish distillery to brora but does the similarity extend to the whisky itself  i discovered clynelish 14 year old just a couple of days ago and having tried it alongside a selection of my other favourites this one is top of the list so pleased to have found it in my opinion there is just nothing that comes close to it  nose swirling light smokiness and warm citrus framed in a suede leather oakiness with threads of vanilla taste a bold citrus and saltiness warming in a comforting smokiness with notes of candied tangerines finish a long dry light smokiness with a maritime saltiness parting with a soft oak and treacle treat lovely  nose mouthfeel arrival developement all great but then you swallow and it theres just not so much too bad without the caramel and chill filtration it would be better i think why not just leave it out its already at a firm 46 i 180 m gonna search for an independent botteling of this cheers  this is the whisky that taught me just how good single malt scotch can be being from the us most of my friends do not appreciate good whisky mostly because they have never really tried any one taste of clynelish 14 yr old and they like me come to understand that there is a whole world of whisky worth exploring  a very interesting and complex whisky at a bargain price considering it s bottled at 46 i would say it tastes of caramel salt oranges and smoke notably fairly similar to some other maritime highland malts like oban but much much better if you like it i really suggest checking out compass box s blends as a lot of them are based on clynelish  i think the standard 14 yo clynelish is like a hidden treasure no one knows how good it is so i get to buy it inexpensively and enjoy the heck out of it shhhhh let s keep this one to ourselves  having married a brora lass and having a father in law who worked in the distillery i can only say that it is the best of the best and has beenas long as i ve known it and that s some time i ve tried many others in my time but i always came back to this one the above despriptions are as accurate as ever and the price here is supurb i ll be visiting again soon and hope to get to the distillery and the shop while i m there enjoy  clynelish is a bit of an acquired taste for me i don t think its flavour profile similar to oban suits my palate particularly it s interesting nonetheless  mediocre my arse this is top drawer malt in its class vintage light but fruity and spicey a promising aroma of lacquer appricots and peach sour sweety spirit on a lacquer and partly flowery background gives a light warming effict short aftertaste of the same kind ends with a hint of wood  mite  difficult to classify interesting and doesnt conform to a generic type definitely smooth dry spicy tangerines and smoke long finish that hints at autumn bonfires and i d also agree to mustard i couldnt detect vanilla or american oak must have another glass but jury is still out  simply excellent just purchased 2nd bottle as good as the most famous malts actually i think it s better i ve only just discovered it too  very classy whisky orangy smokey in the nose oily in the palate a terrific long finish a superb northern coastal malt pale orange colour and full sea salt nose great first taste orange spice then peppery seaweed long finish a magnificent malt and amazing value at this price 
2943.0, what an amazing bourbon neat it 39 s lovely nose has a lot to offer pear like a moravian hruškovica honey slight toffe note oak apples strong bite but not unpleasant apples and pears with vanilla very long finish with water more honey slightly more apple and toffee toffee apple like at a fairground a tiny bit fresh smoke but not peated smoke plenty of vanilla extract flavour superb 93 100 very good as like mm s description very very nice has an interesting cognac note to it lots of nice nuts and fruit as well as the standard bourbon note of oak vanilla has a feel of real fire on the tongue may put some people off but i love a whisky that tells me it has a high alcohol content though if you find it off putting add a few drops to it to cool the smouldering lump that used to be your tongue down this bourbon goes well with just a few drops of water 
3177.0, like with the 10 this is a very different whisky from your run of the mill stuff but it is just fantastic rich silky mouth feel with deep fruits could easily be a 15 or 18 year old whisky oranges oak honey sandalwood on the nose all this plus dried fig toasted almonds and liquorice on the palate long warming finish orange blossom woodsmoke vanilla toffee amp cocoa powder on the finish  great stuff sherry influence very prominent complex and rich good mouthfeel scotch mist like no other also great value where i m buying sweden interesting expression from an interesting distillery  being a big fan of this distillery i decided to try this dougie mcclean dram its a very rich whisky a touch more so than the 10 the extra 2 years have produced more chocolate and a nice honey and more sherried whisky and a great longish finish again it is improved by the slightest drop of water opens up by a huge margin quality stuff but imo needs that 1 4 teaspoon of water struth the more whisky i drink and i ve been drinking it for quite a few years the more i m drawn to those which are not chill filtered and are naturally colored some distilleries like ardbeg springbank bunnahabhain and glendronach don t do it at all while others like powers and edradour only release certain expressions that are not chill filtered and are naturally colored comparing this 12 with the standard 10 which is also very good and naturally colored makes the case that whisky should never be chill filtered the flavors are so complex and deep that it s hard to believe this is only two years older i must also add that the 46 abv makes a world of difference as well  this is not a whisky for someone just beginning their journey into tasting single malt scotches this is a very brave unchillfiltered complex single malt appealing to the sensations fusial aromatic astringent and resinous compounds an unapologetic whisky  i was actually quite disappointed with this edradour i personally prefer the standard 10 year i don 39 t like smokey whiskey at all but i tasted more than a hint of it here and the sherry tones i like in a malt whiskey were not very prevalent here i won 39 t be buying this again i 39 m afraid  i love the islay whiskeys but this one has something different than others from the mainland much better than most of the 12 yo for ne this one tastes more mature than 12 yo i apologize from the professionals  very different smooth and rich in taste i have only tried this once and enjoyed it so much i want a bottle i have enjoyed edradour 10 yr old for some years and thus trying some more  i tried this both in scotland last august and again from a sample i recently obtained from master of malt i like it but not as much as the 10 year old i found the 12 to have somewhat of a hot finish which at 46 abv vs 43 for the 10 could be one reason however i also am currently trying a bottle of knob creek single barrel bourbon which at 60 abv is a monster but does not have a hot finish  classy and full of flavour rich taste amp slight honey taste of brandy with raisins and a spicy tone gorgeous delicious  a rich tasting whisky with a nice finish smooth and not smoky highly recommend a much fuller taste than their 10 year old but that comes at a higher price well worth it  i bought this on a recommendation from a reliable scotch source by the way he made it sound this was going to be incredible for me it wasn 39 t there was not much complexity going on it was just straight forward hit your face whisky the flavors were just not there for me this is not for everyone  i 39 m not usually a sherry port cask drinker but this is amazing thick amp honeyed with a full flavor maybe tobacco leaf or leather and none of the 39 dregs 39 of the cask taste i will be getting more of this  first of all i want to point out that this isn 39 t a single cask bottling it says nothing on the labelling to suggest it is furthermore i asked someone at the distillery and he confirmed it is not a single cask that however does not detract from the fact that this is an absolutely stunning whisky there hasn 39 t been anything that has impressed me like this has for a good while the rustic charm of the distillery comes through in the whisky that s not to say that it s rough or lacks quality in any way it just has craft produced character it s my kind of whisky big bold flavour with some considerable complexity it has pretty big sherry kick yet the spirit is more than capable of standing up to it with a unique sweetness  just wonderful a great stuff i love scottish songs i e robert burns tunes and poems and i think the master himself would be pleased about your stuff great keep onregards from frankfurtwilfried schuler bought a dram of this in the pot still in glasgow very easy on the pallet if you like a darker whisky with a lovely taste this is one i would recommend i tried a dram sample and found this to be simply delightful it s a sweet whisky that is very accurately described in the tasting notes above but smooth as velvet and absolutely a treat to enjoy this would be a perfect drink after any meal if you like macallan 12 yr then you ll love this  i have had a taste for edradour since i first visited in 1998 before the ownership change the products are always drinkable and worth sharing with mates although overpriced when compared to the class of an ardbeg but read on i looked forward to visiting this distillery once again on a return tour to scotland but will never ever again visit or buy their whisky i had booked to do the tour but my elderly mother who is blind and ninety years old obviously was clearly unable to do this however to my total disgust an overbearing peasant class sort of person whom i believe may be the owner refused her entry to the toilets this to me is the most incredible crass behaviour that i have ever experienced as a visitor to scotland was it really you andrew symington who refused an old lady blind from macular eye degeneration entry to your toilets did you choose not to see her white stick or do you just have those 50 pound notes across your eyeballs man i notice that about 25 of your revues are quot terrible quot i might suggest that you take a trip to islay and experience the wonderful service that all the distilleries there provide i just made a whisky buying trip there last weekend and savoured the hospitality and their product i absolutely suggest that your edradour be removed from the itinerary of any visitors to scotland there are many pleasant places to go and where the whisky tastes better note to the scottish tourism board watch out for this kind of poor product on offer to we international visitors it leaves a long lingering bad taste  nice but prefer the 10 yr old i tried quite a lot of single malts before and my cabinet is filled with loads of bottles but i have to say this is by far my new favourite i will try the other edradours too because i think i found quot my brand quot compared to my quot old favourite quot which is the redbreast 12 this is a very quot manly quot malt in my opinion it is like malts are supposed to be i like to compare whiskies which each other so here it goes the malt is very intesinsive and which is i assume the charackter of edradour you have it in the 10 yo old too but not that much which i assume comes frome the 46 non chill filterage it is very thick in the mouth like the aberlour 12 non chill filtered but not as quot fresh quot fruity it is more like old juicy fruits all together with this sickness and this special aroma where i ask myself if it is a hint of smoke or not sampled at the distillery and quickly became a family favourite good wholesome and traditional stuff with its own quirky character just like the distillery well worth a visit nose gentle sherry and smooth lightly spiced oak honey and cream touch of nutmeg and dried christmas fruits and a hint of peel palate well rounded and quite thick with a rich sherry tone and more dried fruits honey and treacle flavours develop and that toasty butteriness identified above really comes through subtle hint of nuts finish good length warming with more toasted oak and malty butter notes quite dry with more nutmeg and spices and a hint of heather honey sweetness a drop of water brings out the sweetness and more of the nutty tones making almonds and pecans identifiable nicely complimenting the vanilla  not especially complex certainly not as treacly as sherry cask maturation can be but everyone who tried it was happy 
3030.0, without getting into details cannot get better than this the most impressive aged whisky from islay that i have had  one of the best single malts i 39 ve ever had the pleasure to know sure wish i would have stockpiled this stuff when it was available if you can still find it good luck do yourself a favor and get it this is one of those rare gems that must be tried to understand words do her no justice  to the reviewer below do yourself a favour and enjoy that bottle this is one of the best whiskies in my bar fortunately i heard in time it was to be discontinued so i stocked up on two dozen but not planning on selling any of them just want to be sure i can open one each year for the next 24 years  wish i could review but i bought one of the last bottles i 39 ve seen of this and don 39 t plan on opening it hopefully it will make me some money down the road wish i found a 2nd one though would love to try it  p 229 taglig doft utav r 246 k samt tj 228 ra inslag av citrus samt n 229 got otydligare andra fruktdofter med p 228 ron bland annat och 229 terigen tydlig doft av vaniljst 229 ng som kommer mot slutet jag tycker man beh 246 ver lite vatten till denna f 246 r att f 229 ut det mesta men jag tycker 228 nd 229 inte den 228 r v 228 rd de extra pengarna j 228 mte laphroaig 10  a dram with a peppery punch in the end but before that it 39 s mellow baked in a relatively light smoke with a lovely maturity and sweetness haha lucky me i found this in a bar at stockholm arlanda airport yesterday my flight was delayed with ten minutes and i used those minutes very well no doubt this is a really good whisky discontinued well things change yes they change  as mom say a dram with a punch  brilliantly taste flavour very smooth peaty and quite exceptional scotch really smooth and refined awesome  you either like the taste or you don 39 t if you like the taste just enjoy it one lifetime is all any of us have  love the laph 18 its still around as a medium high end whisky more on the high similar peaty is ardbeg 10 for bang for the buck its gonna be discontinued get it while u can excellent flavour and taste keep it going  i enjoy my scotch and i will alternate my favorite malt scotch with a 18 yo laphroaig it has a favor that i truly enjoy as we all have hears its going to no longer going to be made those of us who enjoy laphroaig have seen the price of it has and still will see it go up by leaps and bounds one it no longer going to be available the price of it will be unbelievable my question is what will replace the favor of laphroaig i will truly miss it and i was able to enjoy it while it was around  very nice and strong  i like this better than the debut 18 year old expression which was excellent my former favorite was the old 15 while this isn 39 t as peaty it is much more complex and balanced and it is peatier than the previous 18 very nice  a friend brought this to me in ecuador i find this to be the whiskey which i am going to drink for many of my remaining years severe sinus issues prevent me from enjoying the nose but the taste and finish are absolutely spectacular  so much nicer than the 10 truly blown away for the price point this has to be 1 of the best rich and complex yet so smooth wow  awesome  i recall the first time i drank this i was new to the ways of single malts and this was my very first pour the peat hit me like a ton of bricks i was not sure i had spent my money very well so i let it sit and tried a couple other well known single malts so a while latter i revisited this first experience of single malts i was exuberantly surprised as it had mellowed and changed from my first experience and left me drooling for more i can say this is not for those of the light heart it is an acquired taste a taste that suits mine  firstly the rule broken here by many is never tell someone else how they ought to enjoy the whisky they paid for that said i don 39 t feel like a review should be written on anything but a neat dram anyway this is a delightfully balanced drink where peat and sweet dark almost religious notes pervade the nose a very adventurous palate that finishes in style definitely a must try  amazingly complex and smooth i add just a dash of water to help with the higher abv superb   those who would mix this otherworldly scotch with anything idiots  i mixed this beauty 70 30 with irn bru l ib 70 30 and it took my head off classic scotch buy it  i cannot believe how smooth and complex this whisky is i 39 ve been meaning to buy this for a while but kept swaying towards the ardbegs and the lagavulins having taken the plunge i was expecting a similar taste to the 10 but slightly more rounded the truth though is it just offers so much more it is so elegant and smooth with the sweet toffee vanilla element really coming to the fore with the peat lingering in the back ground quot i was expecting more peat quot with a welcome addition of spice and salt in the finish worth noting that this started to taste a lot better once i had left it 5 minutes to open up i would say i now rate this higher than the corryvrecken and probably the airigh nam beist a great whisky the only problem is goes down a little to easily  this is one of the best i 39 ve had in this price range by far love the smokey flavor the finish warms the soul if you mix this with anything but a dash of water you should be hung for your war crimes amazingly i can get this from a local store for 80 usd bottle  unless you 39 re a brilliant mixologist mixing this gem with anything is a shame but adding cola especially seems utterly absurd to me btw the price for this one has gone through the roof  i really enjoy this 18 year i always have it stacked at my home smoke peat yes as many other here say its more mellow than other standard laphroaigs but thats not really why i drink laphroiag or any other islay whisky to taste something mellow prefer all the other laphroiags ive tasted so far over this one 10 yr qc triple wood cairdeas if it had a higher abv it may have had some more punch to it maybe  i normally mix it 50 50 with cola the acidity of the cola really brings out the phenol  great peat smell subtle smoke wonderful maritime salinity provided by liquorice oak chips seaweed and sesame followed by sweet mint i simply adore this dram from islay and became a staple bottle on my shelf passes with flying colors add water and taste how sweet it is then add an ice cube and taste how sweeter it gets simply wonderful  the 18yo used to be a go to bottle of mine whenever i felt like having a softer islay whisky tempered by age but due to the current price i 39 m no longer interested in it for 100 i expect more than this  the nose on tonight 39 s dram was like the hour after grey late autumn rains with hints of ashy smoke the first taste had a strong bite out the gate followed by buttery smooth numbness the whole drink building in a peaty ash adding a drop of water to open it up the taste stayed perhaps a bit smoother on the initial bite the peaty smoke still dominating long after i finish the peat lingers warmly and comfortably in my mouth  a perfect 10 settles beautifully with an inch of monster energy drink the fizz adds a magnificent spark to the smokey undertones of this scotch absolutely stunning  a really good taste on the palate then that warming feeling great why would you waste an ounce of this with soda isnt that what jw red is for excellent scotch i prefer islay whiskys and this is up there in us the price is comparable to the lagaluvin 16 my preference is the lagavulin but thats me this is a great drink a little smoother than the quot like drinking a burning church quot 10 year i forgot where i read that description of the 10 year but its cracks me up excellent all around if you like islays youll enjoy this  i love laphroaig ardbeg anyway but this baby is absolutely stunning let it air out for a wee while and enjoy slowy a tip though if you like your islay drams you really can 39 t beat the qc for taste and price asda today 163 33  straight up there is no substitute  not what it used to be but ok price has gone mad though  a nose that fills the room like an exquisite subtle perfume the taste seems to go on forever changing from moment to moment form turf to a sudden smoke going slowly towards a slightly seebreeze kind of salty aftertaste really can t imagine anything better in the whisky area  please in heavens name tell me you did not mix dr pepper with an 18 year old scotch the ancients are weeping do to your alcohol abuse this is great stuff if you have better sense than to mix it with dr pepper  finest islay i ve tried vastly better than the 10 and the quarter cask or ardbeg 10 or supernova or lagavulin 16 which are in the same cabinet but have gone untouched great peat but refined from nose to finish  fine expression of an islay pleated whisky excelent body and finish but the nose is reminiscent of wet dog nevertheless it is well worth the money i unlike others here am not well rehearsed in laphroaig and its various incarnations i remember a bottle of 10 maybe that many years ago but this 18 is absolutely fabulous bigger rounder longer finish than the ardbeg i love superlative  among my very favorites of islay although for the money you can t beat laphroaig s qc  much more mellow than the angry 10 yr old smoke peat and an underlying sweetness once you get past the gruff exterior the taste of phenol which is so prominent in the 10 is subdued outstanding scotch  firstly mr mrs quot quite overpowering quot 29 oct wowi give this flavourful whiskey a 4 stars as it s unfortunately not compatible with dr peppers and thus loses points for versatility full marks for taste if you drink it neat unfortunately i cannot compare with the 10 or 15 year but compared to other similar distilleries it s one of the more memorable malts  at least i think so  very smokey and overpowering gave it away i can not drink it sorry very overrated  i love that guy whoever he she is that aside the 18 is wonderful stuff so much going on so well balanced lightyears away from the quarter cask which is like comparing century sam s to padron cigars  for many years now i have taken whisky with my dr peppers i find this a great mixed combo and have always enjoyed them together however i have to say that laphroaig 18 does not work with dr peppers and at this price i am really disappointed  just had my first dram of this after prolly a nearly 1 2 a year after tasting the quarter cask its thunderin and rainin and lightning outside and all of that settled into my dram i might just take it to bed just to hug it all night absolutely love it i dunno which ta choose laga 16 or laph 18 both are just great im happy  this a very good laphroaig complex and multilayered smoke with fruity twist not too sweet actually quite dry in the finish i liked that if they only would cut that caramel i really don t like phrase quot mit farbstoff quot  smoky peaty and rich in taste really excellent and a great improvement over the mediocre 15 year old a real whisky for friends of whiskies  the 18year deserves some appreciation for sure but not at the price of 120ish a bottle if you never had the 15 your don t know what your missing fans of the pungent medicinal flavor will be disappointed as it is barely noticeable in the 18 for the price i would rather hunt down deal on some lagavulin 16 as it is less harsh slightly more medicinal albeit slightly less smokey but also only about 80 bucks usually i wil go back to the 10yr laphroig at 40bucks until the price comesdown on the 18 if it were about 70bucks would easily be a 5star  the strong fumey peatiness that is the signature of laphroaig but between these initial flavours soon appears a lingering mellow almond sweet taste has the nicely oily mouth feel of the younger barrelings but with an added sophistication despite the higher alcohol content which means that this whisky both pleasingly soothes and kicks like the proverbial mule  the raw vicious peat is still there but so much more manageable over time it has settled down to become the beauty that it is i go through three bottles a year even though much left to taste this is currently my favourite islay dram cheers from sweden i come from venezuela where blends are kings but a month ago i went to a bar and tasted laphroaig 18 omg what a pleasant surprise the balance of this single malt is incredible with a smokey flavor that is not overwhelming but just about right since that experience i became a big fan of laphroaig distillery enjoy my friends  i could not agree less with the good reviews for this whisky it has been completely stripped of the depth character and flavour to be found in the 10 and the magnificent 15 year old varieties having paid a significant amount of money for this whisky i felt i had been cheated i would never waste money on this product again p j ah yes the fitful 10 year old aged to adulthood definitely has become more moderated flavors more integrated edges considerably softened a nice one to drink with friends especially if they are not conditioned to high peat  to me the 10 tastes rough but with some interesting flavours this removes everything bad about the 10 though slightly tones down the good stuff too easily worth the money over the 10 but though it s better than the quarter cask it s not that much better   are they still adding caramel and only declaring it in german this to me shows disrespect for the british consumer people are using the internet to research inform themselves and communicate with each other i am incredulous as to why it is still being done i can only draw the conclusion that it is to hide inferior barrel usage and although i m keen to purchase this very scotch will not do so until they listen and remove the infernal brown dye  easily more refined than the 10 and i would take a bottle of this over two of the 10 year old any day whether the 25 year old is worth four of these is another question i am hoping to test soon  i have a friend who thinks nothing of 60 120 for a bottle and i can honestly say most of them are very good but none worth the money in my view with one notable exception my personal limit is the price of a bottle of lagavulin 16yo but i bend that rule for this beauty of a dram worth every penny  i love this stuff it s like the 10 year old but with some of the anger removed whilst retaining that classic laphroaig taste i never tried the 15 year old so don t know how it compares would have been 10 out of 10 were it not for the price it s a lot nicer than the 10 year old but is it worth well over double the price pehaps to a richer man than i 
2422.0, similar to a highland park 12 year old malt smokey oak on palate with pineapple baked apple finish  a lovely dark smokey whisky to enjoy whilst reminiscing good old times with friends the fruity finish in this 12 year old is quite incredible for the price this rivals some 15 year malts true value for money to those that find a bad bottle well i haven 39 t had that misfortune i love this blend  used to be my favorite something changed tastes more like red not my favorite ever now  firstly i don 39 t believe for a second that the copious amount of gushing reviews are genuine i have been drinking whisky for more than three decades and i have to say the scottish whisky industry is in a shameful state this is not accidental i believe that a parliamentary inquiry should be conducted and the many culprits subject to excoriating fines and a ban from any scottish business for life as for black label at one of time it occupied a very similar position to that of rolex in the sixties it was a pivotal product no more i have bought several bottles of black label in the last few years every single one of them tasted different and every single one of them was inferior to the black label of just a few years ago diageo is in trouble scrambling around for whiskies to make its signature product and no doubt causing several blenders to be considering a job change there is a solution to this make less whisky  it was still very good even a year ago but current version is simply horrible no smokey notes harsh as red no taste shame i don 39 t think it is 12yo at all i stopped drinking it after 30 years shame  the light came on when i tasted this for the first time even more so when i added water or ice a beautifully smoky finish and pleasant flavour were further enhanced i will still explore single malts but with black label i have found a home nothing the matter with a good blend  one of my favorite blended i have only two chivas amp b label actually better than some single malts i feel a change of taste since past 2 years but still good and full of character only missing part is that slight smokiness  vitamin black has been my go to for years it never fails the peat is artfully concealed in this magnificent blend until you chase a sweeter whisky and then it hits you forcefully this is a liquid elegy to the blender s art le chaim  where 39 s the peat smoke for me in the new version it 39 s almost gone  i m drinking my favorite whisky now black label and i m noticing there is more gain character than malt diageo jim beverage watch out this is not a good sign i am still loyal and will rate this 5 stars but that doesn t mean i am happy i am rating it 5 only because i am a loyal customer johnnie walker dont let your loyal customers down thanks  smoke cigar ash toffee oaky sweet dry fruits and a hint of marzipan hell ya  pleasantly surprised by jwb for a blended whiskey at this price i don t think anyone could complain a sweetly and spicy nose followed by a rich and smoky palate makes for a fantastic everyday dram not being too strong or individual in any one area makes this a great go to whisky  i ve been pleasantly surprised my local supermarket had it on offer at the price of many everyday blends but this is a superior blend i ve been working my way through the usual glenfddich 12yo auchentoshan highland park 12yo laphroig 10yo bunnahabhain 12yo and bulleit bourbon and the jw holds it head up warm and well rounded with a pleasant touch of smokiness the of malts is surely much much higher than might be expected it s good enough to be a sipper but not too exotic to waste as a mixer well done jw  after drinking serbian slivovitz 45 60 alcohol all my life this is like drinking water mixed with expired coke zero not bad but not strong enough still better than other expensive booze i like smoky taste but it should be much stronger in my opinion  beautiful sweet fruity smoky peaty finish lovely mouth feel first bottle and i love it having always thought single malts were better than blends the jw black label has caused a complete rethink it tastes more complex and layered than many single malts creamy smoky fruity it has become my first choice whisky delivering consistent quality at a fair price  bought it from bulgaria kaufland terrible  i think this is one of the best variants of jw the price is very according to the taste enjoying it neatly tastes very good what 39 s more with the addition of ice cubes it tastes much more you can also enjoy it with the added ginger ale  there are a few easy drinkers that i turn to for familiarity and this is one of them i don 39 t know all the tasting jargon but i know what i like this is nice and smoky with a sweet peppery tail end and is fine neat with a salty aged meat or mellowing out over a wedge of brie  i have abi 66 a good jdsb livet 15 woodford martel vsop livet 12 devils cut chivas 12 barely drinkable and now jwb12 i was scared to buy it because last few bottles in the last couple years were utter garbage i had to struggle to get threw them i never mix so this is a problem need sipper i will not say it is the best of my current 9 bottles but i will say it is my current favourite l8206cc002 00056234 i know it is fake with all this fake sugars but this bottle has a rally nice mix of malts i just bought it because i was curious yup hard to believe but it is a sipper at least this my batch  a blend highly underestimated for its popularity and its price 30 years ago single malts were the holy grail today after big companies like diageo etc have prostituted an endless number of distilleries and there are few resisting this 12 year old blend continues to trap me perhaps it is that johnnie walker black tag hasn t changed and the others went down a lot anyway whiskey is very good 92 pts out of 100 price quality is a great purchase always  well it comes down to preferences for this one for me the flavour profile is just perfect for a dram here in cold iceland the palate is smooth creamy with deep notes smoke little bit of cafe but also vanilla i love it there are 35 different whiskies in this one according to what i read the malt is most likely higher than grain well if you 39 re looking for a great blend without flat palate or alcohol burn this is it it only comes down to preferences at least it 39 s a tea in my cup stay safe stay strong lt 3 for a cheap blend this is great tasting i think the problem is people expect too much from a budget drink such as this first impression is that it s really tasty nothing like it s little brother red label which i can only assume has dog turds in the recipe somewhere this actually reminds me of jura origin  underrated drink and doesn t deserve any of the bad rep as a beginner it was my favourite drink as i ve tasted more whiskeys it s not as nice to me anymore as it s very thin and watery that said i still enjoy a nice dram of this  good taste bought an airplane bottle of it to try because my journey is a young one took me three minutes to get the god forsaken cap off since i fractured my wrist in a violent altercation with a 6 foot 9 fellow on pcp i jest not anyhoo once i got past the stiff cap gatekeeper it pours a beautiful dark copper looks great next to the bacon and eggs i m making at 7 in the morning it s going to be a beautiful day earthy notes in the nose brings to mind time spent in the woods which is my favorite smoke and tobacco come to mind also lighter in the mouth than i expected spiciness hits up front then the smoky oakiness comes rumbling up the middle like early 2000 s jerome bettis an underlying sweetness of honeysuckle permeates the flavor and that nice earthy finish brings it in johnny walker gets a bad rap because it s popular and the red isn t the best but black is good flat out it s a good sip for the price shave your hipster beard because contrary to popular belief it doesn t make you more manly and pick up a bottle  ok the best budget blended scotch i got so far  good whiskey but not very good amp a good price tastes like band aids drinking black label for 50 years as it was my father s favorite blended scotch whiskey we both like it better than any single malt and i believe we have tried every single malt many no longer made simply the best  divine water this introduced me to world of alcohal whiskey scotch and i am proud of this divine water it is best when drink on the rocks the blends make it diff taste every passing time and leaves with smokiness if you have to define scotch its jw black label 4 stars for jw black no doubt but i don 39 t see why alot of people don 39 t get the vanilla note anyways the only flaw about jw black is that it lacks body it 39 s a bit thin but the flavour profile is well balanced or at least for my cup  this gets even worse every time damn diageo to hell  as summarised it 39 s an easy whisky to while away the time  best blended whisky period now stop whining casual whisky drinkers  i will only quote the worlds pre eminent whisky expert jim murray from his 2020 review and i agree quot if there is a silkier delivery on the market today i have not seen it this is sublime stuff with the grains singing the sweetest hymns as they go down taking with them a near perfection of weighty smoke lightened by brilliantly balanced barley which leans toward both soft apple and creme brulee those reassuringly rigid grains re emerge and with them the most juicy speyside malts imaginable the lovely sheen to the finish underlines the good age of the whiskies used here it is one of the world 39 s most masterful whiskies back in all it 39 s complex glory quot now if you know more about whisky than jim i suggest you profit off it by producing your own annual whisky bible  very little going on in terms of arrival it 39 s the very definition of quot smooth quot lacking all character and distinctive flavor the 12 years of aging make sure the grain alcohol in the blend is subdued to the point where it 39 s not offensive there is a bit of a peppery tang and some pleasant smoke in the finish but there 39 s very little flavor outside of that a drop of water doesn 39 t do much apart from intensifying a little what you 39 ve already tasted for something that costs so much and still shifts such crazy volumes it 39 s a prime example of a product that sells on momentum perceived status and overly expensive branding if it didn 39 t cost as much as it does it would be at least 3 stars but for the very poor flavor to pricing ratio i can 39 t really do more than 2  i used to dislike johnnie black as i thought it was harsh cheap and oily tasting i must say that the bottle i got for my 40th birthday personalized engraved bottle from 2017 was much better than previous experiences i ve had with johnnie black i will acknowledge that this might be because it appears that as mass production continues and continues as nauseum what they ve added in terms of sweetness and smoothness they ve probably removed in character of the older batches of johnnie black either way though i like the newer batches as it is a welcome change from the more complicated bottles of johnnie black that i m used to water air a few small drops not too much literally 7 8 drops aired it out for 12 minutes one for each year of aging nose raisin honey toffee caramel a bit of wood and smoke tiny bit of mint mentholpalate thick syrupy caramel burnt sugar tiny smokiness and wood very creamy like a melting thick creamy feelingfinish much less bite and spice than earlier johnnie black a bit salty continued toffee and caramel i think it s much better tasting than what i ve experienced in the past but for those that are nostalgic and enjoy the really complicated older scotches are going to be disappointed  some bottles are great some are too briny some are not smokey enough each time is a little different but when it 39 s good it tends to be really good and a terrific value if you can get it for around 30 or less  very ordinary whisky to get drunk quickly not the one to enjoy sip by sip sitting relaxed at sofa any even nas single malt i ve tried has much more taste and character sorry jw fans  pre 80s bottle were a different animal all together now i rather spent a wee bit more for monkey s  not smoky anymore and the grain whisky bitternes makes it almost undrinkable neat it 39 s gone downhill used to be more ish and finely balanced one drop of water would unbalance it it was tantalising one more sip and maybe it would reveal itself now the only mystery is how did they go wrong not even a good mixer because the fragility is still there while the quality is gone  not so good recent bottles are not very good bland and too sweet lack the flavors of previous versions  still unwanted charcoal flavor in the background less sweet vanilla woody notes than before around 2016 17 heres why they even admit to reconditioning tired casks up to three times it shows roast a barrel three times and you get an inferior product please compare to older bottles and you will see how the quality goes downhill so fast  on the nose it is peaty peppery and citrusy on the palate rich with oaky peaty citrusy and spicy nuances finish is long with peaty fruity and caramel notes it is one of the best 12 year old blended whiskies in the world and my personal favorite however it does not smell and taste as it used be around 10 to 15 years ago i think they use less talisker in the composition now as the whisky is much less peaty in addition the manufacturers seemed to have used older whiskies in the blend earlier as black label always felt like as if it were more matured than 12 years but now the company have green label which is 15 years old vatted malt without any grain whisky in the blend i think it is the reason more matured malts now go to the green label however good whisky black label can be it is still distiguishable that it is not exactly what it used to be still i personally love it and think it deserves its reputation  re whence the new peat i have just bought a new batch bottle of jwbl and maaaan the peat is through the roof compared to previous renditions i consider this a heavily americanised blend designed specifically to compete with the abomination which is american ipa a few years ago this whisky was affordable but very well balanced sophisticated even now it tastes more like bourbon than whisky this does not happen by accident i suspect that some heavily charred oak is responsible and some millennial trans atlantic focus group has wreaked havoc with a scottish institution first grouse now this it is an absolute disgrace  beautiful smooth scotch i picked up in my local shop this is the first time i 39 ve tried it an i love it  i picked up a bottle on a road trip i was looking for something else but the selection was limited i didn 39 t care much for the last bottle i bought over a year ago but here i am i will say this bottle is not bad at all the flavor is more complex than i recall and the finish was pleasing maybe i lucked out i may try another  hmmm this is so good blended whisky it 39 s spicy and smoky i love it  i don 39 t understand why this is so popular for price i think it isn 39 t well balanced and neither does it have much character better blends for less money spend a bit more and get green label or if you like a bit of smoke and peat go for double black  i had a mini bottle of it that i picked up at a party and to be honest it stinks i feel like if you want to drink to get sloppy drunk or angry then yes go for it but if you 39 re looking for something to sip on while you work on that project grab a beer or something else instead i guess for me i 39 m not a whisky guy although i am trying to get into it i just can 39 t with this stuff i don 39 t care if it gives you the same type of buzz i want to enjoy my beverage  really i ve read two reviews on this scotch and both were different so here s my honest evaluation from a novice scotch drinker the taste reminds me of the smell of an old box of bandaids from my childhood ah memories the second glass is so tasty it s hard to stop it s just pure mellow peaty  i added a few drops of fuji water and everything improved smooth medium peaty drinkable satisfying reliable blend understated not showy good for every day perhaps a little sedate in a world of new super peated young malts and the like but not worse for it i give it five because there 39 s something quot right quot about it and i keep coming back to it  very overrated product but it is still good and reliable quality i would easily prefer a single malt scotch over this again but for this price when bought on offer black label is very drinkable and a good solid whisky just don 39 t expect to be surprised or particularly enjoy it enormously it is simply a good quality reliable whisky  i am consuming this whisky since 10 years but i am feeling very disappointed with the current batch of black label it 39 s missing the wonderful romance of talisker and caol ila which i enjoyed a lot it 39 s more grainy and less peaty smoke character is reduced and i think content of speyside malt n grain is increased significantly some problems for sure with 2017 18 batch  i can 39 t help noticing the plethora of content free rave reviews from people who know nothing about whisky this is extremely suspicious i have bought many bottles of black label in my time as you knew what you were getting quite complex consistent and worth paying a little extra for i have just opened a bottle after a hiatus of a couple of years and there is a bitter graininess which is tainting the experience the blenders have been very clever there are all the distinctive notes i expect from this whisky the mouthfeel is excellent the colour and legs are the same but the heart has been ripped out of it this is a sophisticated con job which is exactly what we have come to expect of the scottish whisky industry these days a few psychotic ceos have taken the world 39 s most respected product and turned it into a travesty of itself i bet they were hoping that no one would notice well we all did you disgust me  in the past i came close to worshiping jwb recently because my bottle was nearly empty i purchased another at a state store in idaho usa last night christmas in the grips of the celebratory spirit i tasted from the new bottle i must say that i was greatly disappointed quot kerosene quot comes to mind what on earth has happened some reviewers say that batches are inconsistent whether this is true or not i will be very reluctant to buy another bottle in the future this is a great tragedy might the distillery respond with a reassuring report  many people recommend it but i don 39 t really see anything special in it just not very bad  i had the opportunity to visit the kilmarnock factory now closed and feel the smell in the blending shed it was unbelievable  yeah i know it 39 s become fashionable to rag on this product as happens with all popular products and yes the quality is sadly not as consistent nor quite as good as it used to be but if you 39 re not unlucky with the batch jw black is a tasty drinkable and dare i say highly enjoyable dram it easily beats the chivas regal 12 year old and anyone who compares it to the red label is an absolute idiot i think most drinkers would actually prefer this over many single malts as well and not just due to its quot drinkability quot it actually tastes nice sure you can get better whiskies but in this price range there 39 s not much that beats it and it 39 s available anywhere definitely a classic in my book  i 39 m a big fan of johnnie walker black label i often have quite a few bottles of some mid to high end single malts on hand depending on my mood and what my mouth is craving but good old black label gets poured in my house more than any other it 39 s always the right blend of smoke light peat good aroma and a wonderful finish that seems to empty my bottles quicker than i mean to you just can 39 t go wrong with this classic it never disappoints  beautifull blend expression stands up to higher priced whiskies don 39 t listen to the snobs  medicinal on the nose with some orange and raisins viscous and a little watery in the mouth with a hint of grain a mild alcohol burn kicks in and intensifies a little in the back of the mouth ends with a little bitterness which masks some of the dark fruit and spices at the finish clearly a benchmark blend a notch above the supermarket shelf bottlings and their usual harshness due no doubt to the decent amounts of quality single malt they put in subtle grains are ever present giving it a richness but blended mouthfeel  got used to single malts bottled at higher proof but this is reliable to drink at your average bar or restaurant when anything better will cost too much or is just not available a little sweet some islay peat smooth finish but the 80 proof is a little soft and light for my grown up tastes hahaha fair value i haven 39 t noticed the inconsistency others have mentioned but maybe i don 39 t drink this one often enough  the best scotch bang for buck and second best whiskey bang for buck out there eclipsed only by woodford reserve bourbon cheap and readily available enough you don 39 t feel guilty going through a bottle quickly  i am a whiskey and bourbon fan tried jw black for the first time and really like it unbeatable for the price a beautiful drink thanks  the initial burst of high octane funny car fuel is moderated by a hint of nutmeg and flame blackened white oak barrels accented by remnant of eagle scout campfire the finish is pure 39 50s style ethyl in a word invigorating or as stan lee of marvel comics fame might say quot excelsior refuel me again quot stan 39 s assistant to his own assistant quot write all this down smedley stan 39 s newest marvel superhero is going to drink this s for breakfast quot  just recently revisited a bottle of johnnie walker black label bought in 2018 my previous experiences with this blend have been favorable due to the smoothness and mild peat character of the blend upon nosing this blend large citrus notes with vanilla and a slight iodine note become apparent on the palate there is no heavy oak of the cheaper red label as expected for an upscale blend but a fine balance of fruits nuttiness and a mild charcoal peat smoke the finish continues with peat smoke heather honey and citrus touches from the body not peated as i remember but still impressive johnnie walker is a perfect sipping whisky that even single malt aficionados respect i recommend this to everyone as a measuring bar for drinkability for both blends and single malts i give this an 87 100 great accessible way to enjoy islay flavors for those unfamiliar with peated whiskys or scotch in general  i have had and still have several of the most popular and expensive single malt whiskys available my choice for a delicious smooth and accessible evening dram is johnnie walker black it s a classic for a reason the only people that would refer to it as a bad drink are scotch snobs that use an expensive single malt as a social status  awfully nice complex smooth but way smokier peatier than in the past same as dewar 39 s wonder what marketing person thought this accent was important for younger drinkers to associate w single malts weird and a little excessive to my mind and experience of drinking jwb for over 50y ignore all comments that call it mass junk etc ignorant  but that 39 s not saying much it 39 s mass produced inconsistent and chances are if you don 39 t like johnnie red your not going to like black either  the nectar of the gods  affordable blended scotch but there are inconsistencies between batches 9 months ago i took a liking to jwb 12 yo due to its smoothness relative smokiness and sweetness fast forward 3 months ago i bought a 1 litre bottle and the taste was indifferent blandness and decreased smokiness i wasn t sure what to make of it was it me or the 1 litre bottle unconvinced i bought the 70cl bottle from a different shop and felt the same i am very sure it was batch inconsistencies which is unfortunate my guess is more grain whiskies were used to substitute malt whiskies i could be wrong after all who am i to challenge the master blenders  i 39 ve drank a lot of single malts from 8 to 40 yrs old jwb is better than some of the cheaper malts that are less than 18 yrs old it 39 s definately a top blended scotch but a little expensive needs to be taken neat and sipped  not as good as green or gold label but much better than red if you like smoky taste  new bottle new day the problems with inferior quality are still there nose is good arrival is ok charcoal flavor from reconditioned casks dominates the short finish which used to be much longer and richer diageo has gone too far by boosting production to make profit this once iconic whisky is dead in my book which is a tragedy ill never buy it again  this is let down by the signature charcoal flavor of reconditioned casks probably from the grain whiskies they should stop over inflating the marketing and concentrate on keeping a consistent quality otherwise the more serious whisky fans will just stick to single malts  i get a lot of smoke in the nose and in the taste but it isn t pleasant medicinal type smoke it s more bonfire smoke i believe this is the caol ila coming through quite strong there s an aftertaste resembling if i d chewed on a piece of bark i m afraid this is ok for the cost but there are better age statement whiskies out there if you save 5 10 more and pay the cost for a higher quality whisky whiskey  i have never been a big johnny walker black fan i always thought there were just better scotch whiskies for the money my son bought me a bottle for christmas and i poured myself a dram and i almost fell off my chair it was nothing short of brilliant i drink teachers for my daily scotch but love my single malts i have tried many scotchs in the 50 75 range with macallan being my favorite i absolutely fell in love with the johnny walker black it was smooth with a big taste maybe huge with a wonderful finish everyone can laugh at me but i just fell in love with jw black man is this stuff good  i don t know how this bottle continues to get publicity and fame because it is the most overrated whiskey in the world the only reason i have a bottle of it is because i know other people are dumb enough to like it johnnie gold on the other hand now you re talking about good whiskey  the best go to scotch on the market smooth and inviting like an old friend  great blend smooth from start to finish one of scotland 39 s finest looks good tastes good and does you good i was given a bottle of this whisky as a birthday present recently and i was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful taste of itwas always a malt whiskey fan before but i love this stuff with a few drops of water i think that 39 s the best here  didn t like the 1st time 30 years ago but now it is my daily tipple great value for money top marks for taste and peatiness although not as complex as malt whiskys but it has more than enough going on to justify its price a go to whisky after a day s work  this whiskey is a complicated taste that is best drunk neat i like ice covering it as the brings out the origin of whiskey to the mind warmth to the core often drunk in the cold not a sweet drink but definately not a dry boot some leather and pepper with a hint of char  excellent love the double black i consider myself more of a bourbon man although this is a mighty fine dropfirst smell of the nose very appealing taste is very smooth and pleasant  i thought it didn 39 t smell good like whiskeys should this bottle is so bad i 39 ll either give it away to a fan or pour down the sink  very good taste price value just a stunning whisky it may be a bit of a cliche and a bar room staple everywhere but it 39 s an absolute classic for a reason i must have had 30 bottles of this over the last few years and each one is subtly different but wonderfully familiar too smooth fruity sweet and woody sometimes more smoke than others it slips down beautifully and is one of life 39 s rare guarantees that will never let you down  the last bottle i got is terrible cheap grain and coloring compared to teachers 1 3 of the price very inferior was very good not anymore  every discerning adult must needs develop a lifelong friendship with at least one mass produced spirit of reasonable price such a friendship will provide relief and solace in any overseas bar or questionable tavern and allow one to glide through duty free shops friend in hand without dithering johnnie walker black label is among the most charming candidates available absolutely everywhere following diageo 39 s incessant pushing of the brand eminently affordable and most importantly entirely delicious savour this whisky on the front palate for luxurious caramelised date character milk chocolate and orange peel sip it with all the daintiness you can muster as this is a masculine whisky and it will singe your back palate if you gulp it too greedily malts can be wonderful and transcendent but as a loyal companion through fair weather and foul there aren 39 t many that can hold a candle to old johnnie walker black  i love this black lebel  the best whisky in the world and the best selling in the world jw black is proof that single malt snobbery doesn 39 t pay this truly is wonderful stuff luscious caramel and vanilla more than make up for the thin graininess on the palate imho talisker fans in particular should give black label a try  its a whisky with a bit of everything in it i got my bottle for 163 15 and can comfortably and enjoyable drink it neat or with ice on a hot day it is a blend after all sure there is a grain whisky texture to it but it does take you on a taste journey buy it when its on offer or if you cant buy affordable malt where you live i much prefer their green label 15 blended malts bottling at 43 and if you want a diago malt go for lagavulin 16 if you like the tcp medicinal smoke side of things in a stronger hit  excellent paid 163 15 on special offer from asda taste like a cheap bottom shelf grain heavey blend am not bothered because i only paid 163 15 but iv seen this stuff sold for 163 28 a bottle and thats scandalous has abit of smoke to it but so does teachers and famous grouse black and it 39 s hardly any better than them  best whisky in my opinion i love the slight salty notes i get from it  it 39 s a very good whisky indeed nice peat and smokiness finish on this particular blend still it 39 s very expensive and not a good price x quality if you know what i mean save some more and you can even buy a single malt if you wanna try this give it a shot it 39 s a very good whisky a bit watery if you put a teaspoon of water or add ice cubes it justs ruins it and it fades very quickly so try to drink it straight this blend is one of those available anywhere in the world and all of then tastes the same it 39 s a good whisky for ordering anywhere such as restaurant pub parties dance clubs and etc these are on discounts every time grab a bottle on the discount don 39 t pay the full price of it it 39 s not worthy  good to drink perhaps too much sugar in it good addition or alternative  for someone new to smoke peat this may be a good option to try it this may also be a great whiskey for a first timer as this whiskey is very smooth which means it won 39 t burn off your tongue the first time that being said i 39 ve been drinking whiskies for 2 months now in those 2 months i 39 ve had everything from the glenlivet 12 to highland park 10 to laphroaig qc johnnie walker black label is a very watery whiskey the nose is excellent and smells of oak chocolate salt and pepper orange peel red grapes and apples the taste is by far the worst part of this dram it tastes like water with a hint of oak nutty creaminess and spices the finish isn 39 t terrible but definitely not anything great more oak peat and smoke on the finish this would be something decent to have at a party or if there is nothing else to choose from otherwise there are many many other whiskies i 39 d rather purchase for the price johnnie walker black label would be near the bottom of my list for this price point giving this one 3 stars as it is quot ok quot nothing great but not exactly horrible it being so smooth really helps  ok distinctly cheap tasting blend with some nasty grain alcohol there are better blends available than this this used to be good but i just bought a half bottle of this muck and now i don 39 t know what to do with it might use it as cologne or a skin disinfectant for me its no longer 39 drinkable 39 the jw party is over but will anyone actually notice that they 39 re drinking 70 percent grain whisky with a token of single malt flavouring as one guy here noted the hangovers are bad yup that 39 s poor quality grain spirit for you  1st time need to testing i have been drinking johnnie walker black label for 25 30 years one of my top favourites whiskeys and goodies of life  great deal very smooth but has a strong wet newsprint aftertaste on my palate which took hours to go away ill be looking for unpeated drams methinks i enjoy the johnnie walker black very much so it 39 s good taste amp smooth  very nice good i just love it  from nose to the finish this one is just amazing  love this lable i love it yes there are a lot of awesome scotch wiskies out there i have had them all black label just happens to be a fast go to and enjoyable blended scotch  best this whiskey does have many subtleties that i did not notice my friends and i brought out a 5th of this and drank it in one hour shot for shot while the whiskey is smooth it has a tough flavor that even ginger ale could not make nice the next day was migraines for us yet 2 handles of jack and we only wake up with regrets i 39 ll stick to my cheaper stuff methinks  best nice whisky i like the taste of black label whisky past 10 years im buying only this in airport duty free shops  great mother 39 s milk  i have bought dimple 15 jwb 12 and four of those small 0 05 l chivas 12 miniatures i was running low on cash for 3 whole 3 new bottles anyways i knew dimple 15 is great bang for buck you get almost a quality of chivas 18 for almost 20 euros less and even when i had both in a cabinet i could rotate this too easy both 10 10 chivas 12 is my quot everyday quot but i skipped it this time because i wanted to go to jwb after a 1 2 years and damn this stuff is excelent i dont know whether this was because it was a while or is this a better batch or what color wise not as dark as dimple 15 but way darker than chivas 12 i dont know if chivas 12 has gone to the non less e150 coloration now or if the casks are worn out because last couple years they are very light jwb 12 surprised me with forgotten sweetness smokiness and also smoothness i alwasy find it harsher than chivas 12 not this time nope i am realy digging jwb 12 right now and the presentation was a classic bottle in black box no glasses added i went with the cheapest for 29 euros p s do not be mistaken the jwr nsa is garbage total garbage i made a mistake buying a bottle half a year ago  it 39 s the whisky i like the most  this whiskey got me from the balls i don t dare to see it anywhere without asking for a sip  why spend to much money jw whisky it 39 s smooth and has excellent flavor  i believe whoever blended this is are genius as i have attempted to replicate the taste and have failed miserably all the essential nuances of aroma taste and finish that absolutely are integral to a premium scotch are here multinationals have the scale and scope to obviously trounce their competition  good probably the generic benchmark for scottish blended whisky simple straight forward and not complex enough to be not pimped out by the mixed drinks industry having said that if the proprietors have any business sense whatsoever they will return the black label to its original strength  goood my cabinett is full of various rather fancy single malts and i appreciate them all however i never get tired of having a dram of johnnie walker black label if i only could choose one whiskey it would be it  i think the master blenders of this whiskey didnt leave anything a whiskey consumer love not putting it in this whiskey amazing good good this is great stuff can drink it everyday its unfair to see blue label superior to this great whisky  i 39 ve got a bunch of whiskeys in my cabinet right now scotch japanese bourbons single and blended and so i enjoy all kinds of whisky but i must say that whenever i come back around to this dram i am always impressed i forget how good it is because its not a flashy single malt scotch or japanese this is a great entry point period to the world of whisky i will probably always have a bottle in my cabinet somewhere waiting for me to quot rediscover quot how good it is its not about the pedigree its about the taste and johnnie walker black has plenty of it  the best drink ever this is one of the truly best spirits available it drinks like a much more expensive libation smokey peaty leathery sweet with notes of toffee and dried fruit best sipped neat or with a small chunk of ice absolutely smooth tangy peppery finish  love jim beam but jw black label has a smoothness that cannot be matched great with coke  very good quality i crave it all the time equally like water  a day to day drink smooth and tasty not for single malt snobs highly rated in many whisky guides regardless of it fairly cheap price i 39 ve drank green red gold and blue this is still my favourite for the taste i got into scotch about 5 years ago via single malts still love the single malts but i confess to having been pretty snobby about it then one day i ended up with a glass of this just because there was nothing else to be had went and bought a bottle the next day some smoke some sweetness smooth and a nice long finish jw black is now a staple in my cabinet  when i place my glass on my sink after multiple glasses of jwbl the smell of the residue takes you on a journey of the fine constituents of the blend beautiful  i own several single malts and blends i find jwbl to be very rewarding never disappoints and always has a place on my shelf when you want very specific character and depth of flavour and expensive single malt is appropriate when you want breadth of flavour a quality blend the choice and i chose black label  its a very smooth whiskey i ideal for family get togethers  nectar of gods  superb excellent whiskey in universe  one of the finest whiskey very good i had johnnie walker red green gold blue chivas regal 12 grants bells dewars ballantine j amp b monkey shoulder jameson bushmills glenmorangie 10 glenfiddich 15 laphroaig 10 lagavulin 16 etc jwbl is head shoulders knees and toes flying above all of these blends and single malts its everything of everything it s the whiskey when you really want to enjoy a glass of whiskey to sip its famous masculine tasty smooth soft punchy peaty smoky oaky sweet luxury addictive not expensive not cheap available everywhere it s a masterpiece to enjoy only neat and of course responsibly only if you are an expert in whiskey or whiskey aficionado you will understand my opinion even ralfy can t deny it  my taste buds must not be performing as they should because the overpowering nose note for me is burnt bush even the palate is mainly burnt bush it is smooth but i think i will give it a miss in future  i have used it only once i recently purchased a magnum of jwbl and was completely disappointed if you ever smelled a tire on fire burning this is the essence maybe my bottle is bad or something but i dread drinking the stuff  a solid blend  i found the nose quite shy on this one a bit flat on the arrival but after letting it roll in your mouth the magic starts to appear the finish reminds me of the dark chocolat mochaccino creamy and smooth for the price value you just can t go wrong with the black label try it before judging this blended malt deserves its place between the single malt snobbism  not a single malt but good for the price better than most single malts a safe bet i always have this one in the shelf besides my single malts  good taste excellent blend beautiful whisky of johnnie walker excellent blend taste is fantastic  good taste jwbl is an odd scotch to me the nose is interesting with sherry notes and hints of smoke the palate is equally good with a sweetness that 39 s almost a little synthetic tasting but never the less pleasantly transitions into toffee and more hints of smoke it 39 s on the finish that jwbl falls apart beneath the smoke there is an unpleasant acetone sweetness that transitions to bitterness as the finish is falling off while this doesn 39 t render jwbl at all undrinkable it dampens what is otherwise a pleasant whisky and one of the better blends i 39 ve tried  when you want a scotch and you have a cold this is where to go  a good whisky for a fair price this is a really good stuff  it 39 s better than not having any scotch but i 39 d much rather have a bottle of highland park 12 for another 10 or some aberfeldy 12 for the same price or even cheaper than this stuff locally maybe i just prefer the single malts as far as cheap blends go this isn 39 t bad the popularity is lost on me though marketing  this is money well spent if you want a whisky for those non special evenings if you know what i mean it has excellent balance and has a spot on taste perfect for those moments you want to lay back and relax after a hard days work and just relax haven 39 t tried the double black though looking forward to that  excellent  listen forget the over hyped and mass produced stigma this product has it is simply the best go to drink around find comfort in knowing you can order this at just about any corner bar or restaurant it 39 s fairly priced and has such a great classic flavor place your bias on the steps outside and enjoy this for what it is  the best of all blends  a well balanced blended whisky treat it like a single malt just few drops of water you will be never disappointed  rich smokey smooth blend very easy drinking with the distinctive johnnie walker smoke finish a very nice whisky that never fails to deliver  super should be a staple of everyone 39 s whiskey cabinet although it 39 s not the most refined of complex of scotch it 39 s fine after a stressful day or if you just fancy something easy you can 39 t buy a single malt this good for the price in my opinion and most other blends are like drinking battery acid only beaten by blue which unfortunately i cannot afford that as often as if wish so black will do just fine  this was my dads drink of choice and now it mine smooth and yet it does carry a bit of a bite without the burn  very disappointing  it s the nice smooth and drinkable you just can 39 t go wrong with it while the quot upper quot colors like green gold double black and blue seem like overpriced hype green is quite drinkable regardless this is the value leader in the world of scotch so satisfying never disappoints  yes i know single malts are quot the thing quot they 39 ve been the thing since they came on the scene in the 80 39 s but i have to say over years of drinking scotch as quot the whiskey quot i absolutely love johnny walker black it 39 s great over ice with a splash of water it has decent body sweetness and it 39 s smooth and silky it 39 s not exciting or different or in your face notice my peaty smokiness it 39 s just a good after work drink and well made i 39 ve once had the blue very nice but very pricey i 39 m happiest with this as an affordable luxury this is what i keep in my decanter as my quot house whiskey quot  i admit to being a bit of a snob when it comes to blends as i prefer the rawness and honesty of a good single malt however when a blend is this good it just can 39 t be denied in my opinion this is a masterpiece delicately balanced and silky smooth but with enough rough edges to keep it interesting this will satisfy any whisky lover veteran and newcomer alike not only on the nose and the pallette but also in the wallet   quot when johnnie comes marching home again quot a rich and smooth whisky light smoke and toffee a clear touch of maturity a long sweet and gentle finish one of the best whiskies in its price level enjoyable  j w red is hideous j w green is ok j w gold amp platinum are over rated and over priced i haven 39 t had blue label yet johnnie walker black and double black are the best of the lot i prefer islay whiskeys and i 39 ve read that jwb is mostly blended with caol ila and talisker i love this whiskey and drink it regularly you just can 39 t go wrong for the price best value out there for sure cheers  francamente esperaba mas cumple pero no nada mas es como que llega al 6 10 para ser benevolente y aprobarlo yo por el precio no lo recomiendo pero no puedo decir que es malo como si lo creo de j amp b y ballantine 180 s  tonight i am sippin neat in between bites from a granny smith apple try it if it sounds good it is i love this whisky  its an excellent blend one of the best out there very complex but its hard to pick out certain things because all the flavours is so evenly distributed the only downfall i have to say for this whisky is that it doesn 39 t have a lot of body or richness often found with highland whiskies this is the only negative thing i have to say about it compared to other things in this price range 40 it beats many entry level single malts such as glenlivet or glenfiddich i love my islay single malts and have over 50 in my collection i decided to finally try jw black because no restaurants serve any good scotches around here i was very surprised how good the black was i also tried the blue and felt the black was better for the price i agree with the review below jw black tastes like what you would think a scotch would taste like now we just need to get restaurants to not charge 7 a shot when the bottle runs 32  too many scotches try to taste like something else sherry fruit candy cognac this one tastes like scotch whiskey like old leather and pipe tobacco the finish lasts forever  i recently was given by my wife a bottle of johnnie walker double black normally i take and prefer johnnie walker black label but i 39 m sorry to say that it was not up to the mark and i felt not only cheated but also this was a waste of money  i bought the 2 lt of 12 years j w black label from chicago airport duty free on 16th april 2015 i was surprised with the bad test of the whisky i still have not opened the second one which is still with me i wish i have an explanation for that as it is my favorite for the last 40 years thank yourespectfullyfuad garabet i tried jameson tullamore dew ballantine chivas red gold blue double black label black label is the top of all of these whiskeys the king kong of the whiskey world  keep it handy in your bar when the single malts run out  question how do the guys at johnnie walker manage to produce millions of litres of exactly the same quality of black label each year answer of course they don 39 t manage to do this how could they indeed i have come to love johnnie walker black label at home germany as a standard drink of very decent quality and great value but many times when i am travelling i come across jwbl drams which i hardly recognize for instance only recently when i bought a 0 5l plastic bottle at the travel value shop at frankfurt airport if my favorite bottle shop at home had sold me such an un peaty uninteresting bottle i would not have looked at the stuff again i have a feeling that the 43 version of jwbl is the minor one anybody know the difference between the 40 version which i like and the 43 version which disappointed me  this is the quot go to quot laphroig lagavulin talisker cardhu certainly tasted in jwb are great so are the sherry etc i e maccallan not really scotch but great but jwb is the price point and the quality to which all should be measured hitchens was quot dead on quot on this one  as a former single malt snob i 39 ve now seen the light and keep a couple of excellent blends on the shelf the bnj for smooth sweet fruitiness and johnnie black for a little bit of smoke i first discovered it while on the hunt for a lighter peaty dram to start with before working up to the highland park and talisker couldn 39 t believe how good it tasted for the 22 it cost me so i started reading up on it imagine my delight when i found a clip on youtube of the late great christopher hitchens describing it as quot the best blended whisky in the history of the world quot and so i 39 d have to agree after all who would dare argue with hitch  gold label 18 seems to have disappeared also double black tastes weird probably grain in the mix since it has no age blue is noticeably better than black for 4x the price black 12yr is still reliable always satisfying with a dollop of water in a proper glass  from a neat pour exactly what i would expect from a blend soft and silky smooth and not too complex there 39 s a prominent peppery dryness that plays well with some of the sweeter notes but the smoke is quickly lost amongst the spice i found a bitter grassiness that developed in the aftertaste let the experience fall flat to each their own as this has some good qualities however if given a choice in a blended whisky at this price point i 39 d prefer a dewar 39 s white label to this  after the sad demise of the much loved green label this is now their best blend imo it is better than all other jws up to and including blue label a very consistent and beautifully balanced blend it 39 s hard to believe that it contains 40 malts but mortlach and cardhu are prominent contributors with talisker and cardhu providing a little smoke a word of warning be careful when adding water ice as it quickly breaks up the 12 years maturation makes all the difference lovely stuff the go to scotch complex caramel smoky johnnie black never disappoints and great value to boot drink it neat in the words of christopher hitchens quot mr walker 39 s amber restorative breakfast of champions quot  i love this drink as complex and good as anything under 163 50 tho i do have a soft spot for lavagulin and laphroaig this is my go to with the smokier varieties a special treat smooth creamy with a lovely hint of toffee this should be in everyone 39 s bar and it 39 s great for guests who won 39 t appreciate your more expensive malts  i nearly always have one of these in the cabinet there 39 s something very comforting about jw black it 39 s not overly complex but has a beautiful balance of sweetness and smoke it 39 s like an old friend you can always rely on  as the title says this is the house scotv  a bottle of this stuff in my cabinet this is one of the best bottles of whisky money can buy come back to it when you tired of trying other single malts and compare it and decide which way you want to go next  i was never a great fan of the blended though this is a master class smooth to drink and i have to say one of my now favourite tipples great body good smoke though not too much all in all a silky fruity number with a hint of spice superbly balanced with no bite an truly amazing whisky and this is from a stalwart single drinker if you have not tried then i wholeheartedly recommend  the smoke hit quick and overpowered everything else for the duration i guess some people like smoke i don 39 t  i 39 ve started at the premium end of the jw range ryder cup special blue and spice road but realised i hadn 39 t tasted their entry level blends and i 39 m so glad i now have spicy smoky full of taste a real treat for this incredibly low price and should be a staple in any decent whisky collection next i will try the red  jw black is the first blended scotch i 39 ve ever tasted the immediate smell and taste of the smoke was incredibly tasty and the hint of toffee was delicious i liked this way more than the glenlivet 12 i 39 d recommend this to anyone looking for a mainstay in their home bar  tasted fake smoky to me sharp bite just ok  very good taste a litte bit smoky sweet enjoing every day after hard work  i have tried many kinds of blended and single malt this is good for the price i always have it in my collection must have i rank this good for a blend and for a 12 year old in fact the best in the category  complex the smokiness and the sweetness blend in very well and the slight woodiness enhances the flavour as well by far the most complex blend i 39 ve had if one is looking for a refreshing blend and easy to drink one jw black is not one for you it has more complexity compared to other blends the smokiness and the sweetness really blend in well easy to drink smooth and great taste bang for the buck don 39 t believe the single malt snobs posers i 39 d you ask me  the first taste i had of johnnie walker black label was 1963 when i was 7 yrs old my father had a policy that i could quot have a taste quot of what he was drinking at a party i will never forget it i took a tiny sip thinking it would be terrible but found that it tasted very good i then took a large mouthful and savored it all the way down my father vocally lamented the point when i told him in the presence of his neighborhood friends quot dad that is some great stuff quot i have always had a bottle available since i was old enough to buy it for when i would like a wee nip of some excellent blended scots whisky it was my first and is still my best  i am enjoying jw black it is smooth no harsh burn just a nice warm feeling perfect for chilly canadian nights has a smokey smell but not to overwhelming i would recommend to anyone but especially to someone new to drinking scotch time for another cheers  this summer i visited san blas on my vacation to panama and bought a bottle of black label whisky on the airport the bottle stayed in my suitcase until i reached san blas since i just knew this was the perfect place to drink a delicious blended whisky imagine a full moon illuminating squid in the caribbean sea water and stars everywhere let s not forget about the perfect temperature and at that moment the black label was openend perfect if you don t know what i m talking about take a look at these pictures http sanblas islands com pictures and imagine yourself with a bottle of black label on the beach at night cheers i have had johnnie walker black and blue label 12 year and i must say these two have flavor but are overrated especially for their prices of a blended scotch i think people consider this good just because other people say it is they are not experienced in drinking different scotches and because of its high price and strong taste for a newbie there are many other scotches to choose from with smooth and rich flavors that are inexpensive both blended and single malts too much hype for what it really is even the bottle is nothing to rave about to me only the pretentious believe in the johnnie walker set of labels power these are what snobs are the pretentious  black label is available in almost every bar so that s what i usually drink when clubbing but i way prefer haig amp haig pinch for about the same price pinch is 15 years old and a better balance of fruit and smoke the extra 3yrs of aging makes a difference if you really search you can find famous grouse an excellent 8yr old that is almost as good as black label or try some oban 10yr old or any mccallan for a treat  its been my fav sincd i could afford it best ever that s it always have a bottle of this one at home my quot weekdays quot drink buy one than you won t walk alone  smoky sweet and slightly peaty it definitely has slight complexity of a single malt  nihonjins and thais love this tipple ain t bad as a mellow cup or perhaps mixed with coke while in a meeting versatile proletarian  it s the highlight of my day and i have a full life just 11 hours to go delicious  though not a peat freak i find black label to be an eminently drinkable blend quite creamy smooth and fruity but with just the right smoky edge quite a classy nose and very easy to drink even by a fairly new convert to whisky still finding his way like me  this is just so well balanced and consistant that i can t help always keeping it in stock i would love diageo to offer a 46 version it would be the bees knees i strongly advise very little water and deffinitely no ice other higher priced johnnie walkers might have more finnesse but this one provides the best value  this is smooth more refined than say jamesons it has a sharp citrus beginning with a mellow peaty finish i really enjoy this until i can afford blue that is lol  i ve been bouncing around trying many different whisky s predominantly of the scotch variety recently i decided i d give this one a try and while i didn t really know what to expect going in i d have to say i m neither disappointed nor excited by it i found that it finished on the tongue a little too quick for my liking but in that regard i like that it makes it easier to sink while i found it has mild characteristics of almost every scotch i ve tried i can t say anything jumped out at me to give this much character of its own thus i say it s a good starter for people curious about scotch i can t say i ll be going after this one again but that s simply because i have other whiskies that are more to my taste in this price point i am glad that i got a chance to try this and may keep a bottle in my cabinet to give other curious parties a taste of a nice entry level scotch  having decided i didn t like scotch a few years ago i recently decided to give this a try for no other reason as hitchens planted curiosity tried it with a splash of perrier and have to say it s not all that bad none of the overpowering burn i used to get and quite a nice toasted sweet flavour fruity after taste i decided against any ice so it remained really aromatic i shall buy a big bottle of this as i just tried a miniature to start with hitch will be happy to know he was yet again quite right although i m sure he knew that already  the old stand by even if you don t like blends it still satisfies always bet on black yeah  i mst say this is lovely i don t like peat until now this is amazing and when it is on offer well worth it at full prices hmmmmmmmmm great blend great price only thing better is the jw gold or blue  i have just recently gotten out of my teenage years and my college buddy gave me a bottle of this and double black as a birthday gift and graduation gift respectively although i did have my share of cheap scotch back in high school and college i never really went out of my way to buy a bottle with my own money so this was my first time to actually take my time and enjoy black for me at least it was amazing no burn at all went down my throat like cream and nothing about it was overpowering this along with chivas 12 became the gateway for my interest in scotch m g mnl philippines  but too expensive a huge improvement over the red label it s an ok whisky i guess but i never seem to remember anything special good or bad about it after i ve drank it though so there s that  a nice blend with an interesting nose smokey and peaty and sweat at the same time tastes smokey fruity with a hint of creamy toffee all in all an enjoyable blend  sweet and smoky complex and easy highly recommended blend   quot i ve 5 of black labels bottles since over 25 years ago i wonder how it taste like or how much it cost now quot it ll taste exactly the same as the day it was bottled whisky gets its flavour from the barrel  a sweet blend after drinking only single malts for several years off and on i decided after reading reviews from various sites including this one to get a bottle of jw black at the local sams club last night only 31 00 with a coaster set gift box a decent 2013 price now i also have some nice coasters i have to say i like jw black but to my palate it is very sweet to me it s the crown royal of scotch but it s good and enjoyable and easy if you like crown i think you ll like this i will keep a bottle in the supply chain from now on i love the color and as described by other reviewers above it has lots of flavor although it s a bit sweet for my preference but it is good and can be used as a decent and tasty example when sampling various scotches especially for beginners it s forgiving and friendly and smooth if you are a beginning scotch enthusiast it wouldn t hurt to start with this and move into single malts if you are a scotch veteran it would never hurt to have this in the collection just for the heck of it  i ve 5 of black labels bottles since over 25 years ago i wonder how it taste like or how much it cost now when i was very young i never liked any whiskey now though i m forty five still a novice i ve tried other whiskeys but only after trying jw like others maybe i was curious to try it after the late great christopher hitchens had said it was his own particular favourite i love it the smokiness the richness the peat i ll try others but right now this is for me and i know nothing of the blenders art but thanks to you and of course the hitch  the jump from the red to the black and the price point is the best bang for the buck beyond the black is a classic case of diminishing returns the green blue gold and platinum are all amazing but oye the cost the black is right in the pocket  bang for buck best blend on the market never leave home without it just superb in every way for the price i feel it s unbeatable perfect on the rocks and never disappoints  churchills dram of choice apparently great everyday drink not to complex good flavour profile good on its own or with a cube of ice good one to start an evening before moving on to something more complicated stable for the cupboard and good one to start friend on the whiskey road good value single malts at this price point tend to be disappointing good alternative so some of the supermarket bargains  a nice smooth start but far too much peaty taste for me an acquired taste  very sad to say no not for me might try the green next not bad but noting to remember visited the scotch whisky experience and picked up a couple of miniatures to try among them was a jw black 12 in a cheap nasty plastic bottle put off trying it for a couple of months then thought quot what the hell quot next thing i know i m finding out where to buy a proper sized bottle excellent balanced whisky for anyone but especially for beginners like myself i could suck this back all night  one of the better 12 year old blends best enjoyed with water av rampersad trinidad west indies  not bad but why buy an expensive blend when for the same price if you keep your eyes open you can pick up some of the best single malts i ve paid less for highland park mcallan jura and caol ila for example  i haven t found a better every day whisky than this hitchens hit it dead on a splash of perrier makes this a drink you ll look forward to at the end of the day  i drink lots of single malts but sometimes i go back to this or get it at the bar no ice no water it is well balanced leaning towards smokey slightly bitter citrus high quality consistently excellent and never hard to find 85 100 ignore all the snobbery around single malts versus blended whiskies this is a great scotch and deserves a place in every scotch drinker s cabinet a great combination of a smooth taste and complex nose ignore red label this one is in a whole other league  had it in poland for just 89 polish zloties ca gbp 17 25 a 0 7l bottle  i dont have the most sophisticated palate but this hits me in on the right places and i enjoy it a lot while on a more special occasion i d like a single malt glass of lagavulin or laphroaig i still enjoy the balance in this blend very much great smokiness balance with light peat and sweetness as hitches said quot johnnie walker black breakfast of champions accept no substitute quot spot on  great great value for money easily blended or can be enjoyed on it s own pretty much the staple for jw  the reason i vote this the full 10 stars it because quite simply you will not find a whiskey so easy to drink and so nice for the money i first drank this whiskey in a nice bar in london and then made me buy a bottle within the week  it s just the best package of everything i want in a scotch whisky and in particular with a full creamy mouthfeel it s not cheap but still pretty good value comparing this with the black bottle another very nice blend with a similar profile it s quot fuller quot and more satisfying and it s a lot more balanced than black grouse which isn t that bad too but just doesn t come close to jw here  overpriced but always satisfies incredibly balanced with a full rich body and the the perfect range of the flavors we ve come to associate with most scotch whiskey a scotch tour in a bottle there are less pricey blends that are just as good though  for this price you ll not find a better blend of scotch although if you have twice the dolla ballantine s 17yr is unbeatable  it s a complete whisky great taste  a great whisky not the best but probably the best in this price range  kir tush khord pahlush i can drink this like water  nice this blend has a truly complex nose with a bit of smoke and a juicy fruit oily and creamy in the palate giving an opulent mouthfeel finish is quite long in sum a respectable player in the premier blends league 
109249.0, first time i ve cracked open a bottle of redbreast i ve enjoyed every drop will definitely buy another a fine whiskey  a great tasting whisky at a great price that never fails to disappoint the redbreast family of whiskies are amongst my favourites
2547.0, i am switching to ledaig from lagavulin if i can find it in nc  this is a very good scotch but if you want something that goes that extra mile go with talisker 10 however that doesn 39 t mean this shouldn 39 t have a place in your collection its well balanced mild and easy to drink its a slightly beefed up ardmore legacy very good just not quite great  this is a lovely dram much more palatable than the ledaig i used to buy in tobermory twenty odd years ago not as bold as some of the islay heavy hitters but a well balanced medium bodied peaty island whisky what 39 s not to love  even if you have trouble pronouncing this peated masterpiece by tobermory don 39 t forget to savor every drop it is in the 4 out 5 range of smokey and peaty just the right amount in my book it wont overwhelm like laphroiag or ardbeg will its just like goldy locks 39 porridge just right this is my go to when im looking to be bold but not over the top  ledaig collects all the jars of soaking paint brushes from local diy fanatics colours the liquid with some nice brown creosote and bottles it  this was my favourite reasonably priced quality dram for years smokey peaty fruity coastal and a lovely pale straw colour it 39 s now inexplicably been murdered with e150 caramel what a letdown desolate  pleasantly surprised i prefer islay heavily peated smokey whisky but this was excellent  this really is a terrific whisky and better than expected anyone who likes port charlotte 10 this is very similar just not as heavily peated for less than 163 40 this has to be one of the most underrated scotches around terrific  good but taste close to islay mist cheap blend however not disappointed  perfect balance of smoke and spice with a lingering finish which excites  wit a dram beautifully balanced full of rich coastal flavour plenty body and an amazing smoky sweet finish that lasts for several glorious minutes hats off much nicer than talisker in my opinion and a very good reason to return to mull one day  what a pleasant surprise from the isle of mull i 180 m a fan of islay whiskies and just wanted to try something new in a blind test i 180 m absolutely sure without the overall sweetness i would guess that this is some high end laphroaig there 180 s even that ashy aftertaste of laphroaig in it at first you should give it a short rest in a glass water isn 180 t necessary i didn 180 t even try it then in the nose it 180 s very much like ardbeg 10 but after tasting it it 180 s far from ardbeg 10 more balanced more stable more lively still i would say that ledaig 1o isn 180 t the most complex whisky in the world but after that familiar peaty smoky tar and seaweed that 180 s so characteristic to islay there 180 s some absolutely lovely salty and peppery tones in it also some entry level talisker wax but much much more in the context this whisky is very far from the cripple entry level versions of talisker and bowmore even though it 180 s very sweet sweetness dominates a little bit but doesn 180 t cover too much in it really outstanding at it 180 s price i ve never ever tasted anything better at the price highly recommended five stars because of the price quality ratio  if you re man or woman enough to cope with a proper powerful whisky which improves with a drop of water you ll likely enjoy this if on the other hand your preference is the lightly floral gentle and slightly effeminate whiskies from the spey this is not for you absolutely delicious you serve it by the slice  it was one of 3 miniatures in a christmas gift pack i d never heard of it a very nice drink much stronger than most whiskies i drink a pleasant peaty taste i immediately googled to see where i could buy it thanks to whoever it was who bought the gift well thought out  nose peated pungent caramel palate mercurial torrents of phenomenal peat 160 after it latches hard to the palate and will entertain for an age but what an age  first off ignore the reviews of people who clearly don 39 t like a peated whisky it 39 s as stupid as complaining white wine doesn 39 t taste like the reds you always drink this is a cracker of a dram amazing depth of flavours mouthfeel and finish all bottled at an abv of 46 3 go back to your boring glenlivet and fiddich 12 39 s if you don 39 t like this one but for the love of peat don 39 t go out of your way to bash something your palate cannot comprehend  warming light and not too smokey with none of the treacley notes excellent very pleasant whisky doesn t bring a big wow but very very good rich on taste because of good abv probably dry peaty and tiny bit of sweetness but almost non smoke is obvious but not overpowering at all finished a bottle with my girlfriend much quicker then expect definitely buy again  not as complex as lagavulin and not quite as smoky as ardbeg but you d be forgiven if you thought this was an islay quite dry with a brine finish surprised at how peaty it is considering its description on here has got an earthy finish though certainly not the best smoky dram i ve had but not the worst  nice one to settle on the couch while watching your favorite team on the telly not very complex but an islay for sure  the worst whiskey i have ever tasted it tastes like a bi product from a weed killer factory if you want to make some ill or just piss them off with a horrible gift they will never forget this is the stuff un dramm di 10 anni assolutamente unico ottimo rich and savoury salted caramel and barbeque bacon sweet savoury umami  i love it i enjoyed it but found it to have a taste a bit too salty reminiscent of caol ila interesting whiskey nonetheless  great single malt with light peaty smoke scent and after taste also slight sweet caramel tasting as i 39 ve gone through l my whisky pilgrimage over the last few years as a heavily peated smokey whisky this is up there with anything from islay this is a marmite whisky though if you only drink prayed frame then this is for you if not then it ain 39 t frankly for 38 quid it 39 s a steal  tried this 2 weeks ago and love the light smoke infusion good value a pleated gem from the isle of mull being a laphroaig fanatic i truly appreciate the phenols smoke and peat in my whisky this expression has it all with a sweet and savoury note in the long finish caramel and toffee notes are present with dried fruit and quality cigar smoke to round the palate for the money this dram gives all islay expressions something to worry about  nose bacon salt herbspalate herbs with much pepper sweet malty and a touch of spicy smokefinish salty malt licorice and oakall in all a very good relaxed whisky with a touch of islay mildly peated not so as much as an islay but you definitely know it s there has a strong coastal influence think talisker but with a little more smoke and without all the e150 they load it with it has some depth and no artificial coloring definitely a great alternative to islays if your wanting something good but a little less smokey i d put it as being better than laphroaig 10 but not as good as ardbeg 10 it has a slightly off putting taste to it at when first opening and needs some time to air out and a couple small drops of water before consuming  a delicious dram with the islay profile through and through smoke dry fruit applewood brine seaweed and a peppery sweet note on the finish i have enjoyed and tried many islay expressions but this is by far the best offering for the money my whisky bar will never be without it  i haven 39 t got much more to add to the good tasting note cited here a delicious whisky and quite heady at 46 3 it 39 s just that as noted in your note there is a strange taste which hits the back of the nose can 39 t describe it better than that that the reviewer describes as a quot hint of iodine quot i find that this is really a fault and not welcome although it is not predominant  every fan of islay whisky needs to try this brilliant peated malt the negative reviews below do make me laugh clearly peat novices haha i guess we were all at that stage once in our drinking careers my new heavily peated staple lt 163 40 others i recommend are lt 163 30 talisker 10 laphroaig qc lt 163 50 lagavulin 8 lt 163 60 longrow red lt 163 70 laphroaig 10 cask strength lt 163 100 lagavulin 12 cask strength if you favor peated islay whisky as i do give this try i 39 ve worked my way through my first bottle and i will certainly purchase another  nice balance between salt iodine peat and caramel  time was you could buy ledaig at a ludicrously inexpensive price from morrisons it cost less than some blends it was a very pale whisky young and full of itself a brawler of a dram this ten year old has a richer colour and is a tad smoother a splash of water releases a whiff of smoke but it is the finish which surprises and delights me full and sweet i like it  i had tried and liked what i now realise must have been the 12 year old in a hotel bar i didn 39 t get a good look at the bottle i bought a bottle of this hoping it was the one i had tried or if it wasn 39 t i assumed it would at least be a decent substitute how wrong is it possible to be this is seriously nasty stuff charred creosote timbers as described below is exactly what comes to mind i 39 d tip it down the drain but i 39 d be concerned at getting the environment agency on my back  its suposed to taste of iodine try their toby 10 if u don 39 t like the hepi scrub whiskys or maybe quinta ruban for something different  horrible wow what a pleasant surprise every islay fan needs to buy a bottle of this you won t be disappointed my new go to peat fix for under 163 40 at first taste medicinal bonfire spicy smoke must say it grew on me after a few sips loved it taste lingers on the palate gave way to craving it haunting smoke drew me back great dram  pour a double in a low ball glass amp add a dribble of water leave for at least an hour you get a completely different experience peppery sweet cereal warm dry peat smoke long finish it is indeed is far superior than it 39 s price tag amp age suggests but needs to be treated with respect to coax it out from behind it bullish exterior  i agree with many of the tasting notes here oily briny kippers ham but quot soft quot quot gentle quot and quot quiet quot peat is nowhere near the mark it 39 s heavily peated or at least my bottle is i get the impression from others that unless a whisky is from islay it can 39 t really be peated but i 39 m tasting this side by side with port charlotte 10 ardbeg 10 uigeadail kilchoman etc and this is not lightly peated it 39 s heavily peated but just a different style to islay i think examples of lightly peated whiskies would be bhunnahabain 12 or springbank 10 anyway ledaig pronounced lechaig in case you didn 39 t know is really really good stuff with a rich mouthfeel like tobermory and is much cheaper than many lesser whiskies that have bigger marketing campaigns but don 39 t deliver when you open the bottle the finish seems nice and long to me and i 39 m not left with a bad aftertaste as some have mentioned maybe it 39 s improved if you like peated whiskies and i mean the taste of them and aren 39 t easily swayed by marketing or dogma get some it 39 s delicious  so impressed with ledaig subtle smoke with peaty undertones balanced with a smooth aftertaste excellent as an islay whisky fan for many years i thought i d never be tempted by a malt from a different isle i was wrong great nose smokey but not too medicinal long finish with or without water perfect companion on a long winters evening highly recommended  ledaig astonishing malt this single malt is great  this is a fun whisky if you drink it neat it 39 s smoky but if you add water the smoke clears and you get layers of malt and fruit underneath that doesn 39 t always happen with islay whiskies with some of them adding water just dilutes them but they remain smoky just weaker ledaig is an different beast i like it  i had quite a difficult time with this bottle i cant take away the latex taste of it reminds me of my bdsm ex gf i only chose to review this after reading the quot it 39 s not for me review quot that gave 1 5 stars first off i completely understand if that was the case due to say not liking really peaty whisky or a strong floral note in a certain type of whiskey the case of that reviewer was clearly from a bad sample that 39 s it if you are a whisky drinker you will know you can easily get an expensive bottle from a bad bottling or off cask it 39 s part of the journey and thus the adventure always give it 2 chances as for my own review take equal parts talisker bruichladdich benromach add a dash of ardbeg and laphroaig and a pinch of highland park you arrive here perfect abv non chill filtered you can 39 t go wrong if you like a bit of smoke a bit of depth and a bit of zing and character here you go most of the tasting notes from other reviewers i found to be the same so to save reading it again i kept it simple happy new year to all  i am on the internet now finding out more about the best tasting single malt i 39 ve tried many but i could taste the deep rich oak ness of the barrel it 39 s lived in for 10 years beautiful a must try for peat lovers it 39 s not a peat bomb but its a different take it 39 s rich and meaty really it has a little meat taste nice coastal flavor from start to finnish one of my favorites  i 39 m an islay whiskey particularly ardbeg lover through and through for me this this is as close to ardbeg 39 s ultimate range as i 39 ve experienced and more affordable to boot if you like ardbeg and haven 39 t tried this do yourself a favor and get a bottle bloody delicious  i don 39 t know the first thing about identifying tastes and smells i just know that i really like this whiskey since bruichladich stopped producing the wonderful laddie 10 this is my new affordable favourite  this is a great tasting whiskey except for the after taste it leaves the taste of burnt english blend pipe tobacco in your mouth for hours  if you like talisker 10 you 39 ll love this it has that familiar germolene smell amp taste you love followed by roaring bonfires amp smoked kippers the finish is light amp dry with a slight saline edge that makes your mouth water ledaig 10 can definitely hold its own against the islay big boys  first try is meaty with the smell of charcoal smell reminds me of an old chimney ironically i find the smell to be quite salty like smelling the cliffs at the beaches or something like that some jasmin even menthol in the background but the smell is dominated by the meaty peat smell taste is much like in the smell seasalt ham and campfire then coal and some honey slight note about jasmin some menthol as well the middle is strong quite decent found the beginning and the finish to be lacking the mouthfeel is meaty peatsmoke that leaves too quickly conclusion i personally found this whisky to be quite good but i 39 m slightly dissappointed it 39 s lacking the amount of aroma that i expected it 39 s quick and feels like it has forgotten something along the way wouldn 39 t wonder if this would be used while making hankey bannister heritage because i found the taste profiles to be quite identical but ledaig is a bit longer lasting not worth the money unless someone wants to split the money to the purchase it 39 s good to have with friends but honestly a good whisky should taste while you 39 re alone as well i stick with hankey bannister even thou i still tell that this whisky is a good one to try but to me it 39 s sadly missing the fresher notes and dominating too much with the smoke and ham 83 100 i first tried this 10 year along with tobermory on the ferry from craignure to oban and i absolutely love both and knew i would have ti get my own bottles of each wasn 39 t easy to find these but i did and couldn 39 t be happier with them this has the same amount of complexity as tobermory 10 but with a totally different flavor profile due to the peat smoke very smoky with lots of nutty flavors pepper and barley with a beautiful ocean spray finish this is a fantastic single malt with excellent character as is everything from the tobermory distillery cheers the sugarbear sorry i really do not appreciate nose flat mouth alcohol palate some spice afterwards final flat a slight smoky dram with small qualities i have no regret to test only one 5 39 sample for the same price the sample of wolfburn gives more in all views and incites to buy a full bottle this one is not for me  just had my second to last pour out of this bottle and my glass is empty but the lovely scent keeps lingering when i have a smell of the glass the smoky smell with a hint of ham or bacon even lingers awesome dram  wonderful scotch it started out with a peaty smoke and ended with a wonderful salty finish in the middle you have a melody of wonderful flavor  don 39 t like the other islands whisky talisker that much but i was pleasantly surprised by this pour nice peat and a whiff of iodine really liked it actually brought a bottle home with me after the tasting  sweet lightly peated and full mouthfeel  presentation the ledaig 10 year old comes in a nice stumpy clear glass bottle with grey labels with white and silver print the year of the distillery 39 s founding 1798 is embossed in glass as is 39 isle of mull 39 and the cork stopper has a great looking image of the isle of mull carved into it resembling an ink stamp good mix of modern and classic design elements appearance pale orange in colour uninhibited by coloured glass no indication of e150 caramel colouring being added but the label makes no point of it not being added either non chill filtered and bottled at the telltale 46 3 abv whisky trivia the esters commonly removed through chill filtration are soluble therefore not visible in solutions with an abv of 46 or greater it is a good indication that the whisky has not been chill filtered if it is bottled at or above 46 abv aroma the smell of that grey partly dirt diluted salt water river beach not the full on white yellow sand ocean beach smell faint smoke mud citrus lemon or orange addition of water brings the citrus fruit forward and some vanilla flavour odd smokiness like licking a burnout off asphalt oak addition of water makes for a more pleasant smokiness finish medium length building spice bitter right at the end would i buy it again i would buy another ledaig for sure but perhaps not this 10 year old ledaig expressions are often released by independent bottlers and there is an 18 year old distillery release i am open to trying these but there are plenty of other peaty whiskies that i prefer over this one i highly recommend adding some water to get the most out of it whiskydad first nose and taste was a concern overall medicinal and spicy three days later however it changed nose wax mild tcp and oil taste ginger star anis subtle sweetness strong tea ham oddly enough this was a good thing it had a strong boiled gammon moorish finish very unique i agree with everything the master of malt says above couldn 39 t add anymore to it not quite an ardbeg 10 but then again it 39 s not meant to be great value for money shhhhhhhsshhh keep it a secret  so easy drinking with wonderful smoke and lovely finish no heat likes a big glass like the ardbeg one some water is obligatory to open it up malt flavour is very beguiling bargain really  after trying this dram and then buying the next in line the talisker 10 i can say with full effect that this is much more full of the sea than talisker 10 surprising but i i like this a lot better excella whiskey with a nice complex profile i picked this up as a single in the store with a bottle of dalmore 12 heavily disappointed and i must say out of the two i enjoyed this a lot more for me i got exquisite tastes of both brine and smokiness took me to a place of saltiness but a certain warmth that comes with a warm fire beside that crashing sea like being on the cliffs beside the ocean the afternoons are very pronounced as some say it really helps to add a drop or two opens up some of the flavors previously hidden or if you want to wait you can obviously i can 39 t wait with a single dram so i wouldn 39 t know just assuming enjoy this it surpasses my love for talisker storm  1st time drinking ledaig impressed on opening if it lasts the week in the decanter i 39 ll re review any improvements appears cask strength like that drank with a bit filtered soft water a large couple of glasses and a few quick shots both in crystal cos i 39 m posh haha not and now its in feeling and appreciating a lot of complex air and aroma sea spray saltiness and i 39 ve just been climbing the cliffs recently and this is a good reminder smokey that lingers and is just lovely and distinct a yearning for more and more of this richness like a sweet laphroaig 10 or cask a nostalgic flavour of thatched smokey croft houses with open fires by the sea delicious with smoked salmon reminds you of yr scotts heritage enjoying this a lot and should be sampled for the journey and price enjoy glad i opened this birthday present early haha  this is a very focus and gentle smoky whisky it is not as bold as some of the islay 39 s stuff but rather light easy drinking and well balanced with spice and light crisp fruit bought it at a local brooklyn store for around 58 usd love the sea salt brininess highly recommended  too much peppers and earth taste very rough i 39 m disappointed  this is a much better dram than the old version and it is currently my favorite affordable peated whisky yes it is quite young and crisp but there is also a freshness that comes with this and it doesn 39 t lack in complexity or smoothness it possesses a particular mix of smoke and sweetness that reminds me at times of the sherried uigeadail but the overall flavor profile probably sits somewhere between the youthful extremes of ardbeg 10 and laphroaig 10 it has less muddy peat in the finish than the laphroaig and less overripe fruit on the nose and finish than ardbeg it is in fact quite unique and i prefer it at the moment to both of these great whiskies  chiming in to reiterate what others have already advised if the strong initial impressions of iodine medicine bandaid in nose and taste put you off let it breath for a week or so i left it open in the cabinet and gave the bottle a gentle turn every day or so for 6 days the stong iodine nose and taste gave way to a sweet smokey vanilla frost like nose similar taste with brine pleasant smoked peat and smoked meat and light pepper in the finish really enjoying this now over the past month or so  slightly medicinical very earthy and strong stuff with delicious hints of smoked bacon highly recommended and a good bang for the buck at 46 3 plus being non chillfiltered and sans coloring  you can 39 t dilute this enough the spice and smokiness are always there in full bloom great quality for a great price and an adventure for islay loyalists  age statement non chill filtered perfect strength this dram has it all cohesive tangy fresh peat with a smooth smokiness and an undertone of quality oak developing into a surprisingly complex but never confused palate and finish leaving you with a lingering peppery spice there are a lot of ingredients that make up the ledaig but i cannot think of a better balanced dram for this money what stands out for me is the value this is similar money to a standard laphroaig at 40 with its caramel and chill filtering and a darn sight cheaper than a lagavulin or a port charlotte and although they are fine whiskies in their own right when it comes value the ledaig is head and shoulders above either i 39 ll be back for more the smoke is not to strong wonderful stuff makes a nice gift for your happy hour friends i love my islay scotchs and so i decided to buy a bottle of legaig 10 i find this to be a very good scotch it is a nice peat with some great smoke flavor i especially love the pepper finish this scotch has won it 39 s way to my normal rotation this tastes like bowmore with a spicy and peppery finish  nose soft sweat peat nice maritime notes nut oil the latter is quite nice and dominant palate martime peat medicinal notes peppery finish medium spice and smoke overall very different for the tobermory yet still recognizable nutty nose and peaty palate  as a regular drinker of the peatier islay malts like ardbeg i find this a more subtle but still pleasantly smokey experience very drinkable with a soft mouth feel starts malty with hints of oak and then the oak starts to smoke on you lovely peppery finish with a faint citrus zest somewhere in the background  i d not even heard of this till this month but what an enjoyable whisky and what remarkable value pleasantly dry and satisfying not at all bland  terrific malt high concentration of fruit with the smoke and peat coming late very complex for its age a lipstick waxiness hides teh character for the first few seconds mouth coating when combined with food this malt loves swiss cheese a partnership made in heaven i collect older whiskys and this one has made it to my every day drinking bin  ghastly went down the sink goes great with water or without the smoke is perfectly balanced with the salt pepper finish i go through probably more of these than i should do but its such a damn fine drop  fantastic drop this one on top of the sea salt and pepperyness that others have chimed in the smokiness has a real cigar feel to it along with notes of riding leather great neat add some water and bring some of the sweetness out  if you think of the un chillfiltered islay whisky this lives up to expectations almost 100 i prefer tobermory 10 myself but this has more of that islay oily smoky feel to it if looking for reasonably priced quality islay this is recommended stuff  like the others have said knock the top off and leave it alone for a week or so what a difference it makes this little beauty is one of my favourites  i find almost every incarnation of ledaig i ve ever tried benefits from some open bottle time it s amazing after a fortnight of being open how it appears to approve so markedly as detailed by others here i was hugely disappointed with an independent bottling i once tried so much so that it nearly went down the sink i gave it the benefit of the doubt and it was if the liquid had undergone a miracle transformation it had become sublime  when i initially bought this and cracked it to have a taste it seemed far too green and young i had purchased it on the promise of a slightly different peated whisky from the standard islay variety i have to say i was disappointed because i could hardly sense any peat but got only an overwhelming feeling that this had been bottled too early fortunately the ledaig 10 year improved by leaps and bounds after having been open for about a week i m no chemist but i m almost certain that the small amount of oxidation made a marked difference now tasting it i can agree much more wholeheartedly with the above tasting notes although the young green herbaceous taste persists it s now balanced with a delightful fruity complement something almost reminiscent of cognac the oak barrels also add a gentle mildly vanilla note to the whole affair and as one reviewer above as said an extra drop or two of water will draw out those sweet vanillins and the apple y fruity notes somewhat without destroying the flavour the peat is now also much more apparent much to my relief i have yet to try the tobermory 15 year but i suspect that this would make a good complement to it being a slightly younger more peated and rougher version buy with certainty that this will be a good whisky just don t expect it to be one the moment you open it i m giving it a four for the development of a rich and relatively complex palate but a few marks off for not having a particularly distinctive or lingering finish  i bought this to replace talisker 10 as my island malt i like to keep one from each region with no overlapping flavor profiles ledaig 10 is what talisker 10 wishes it could be 2 small drops of water and this really opens up oily seaside spicy peaty exactly what you d want from an island whisky i will definitely look at tobermory s other offerings once this bottle is finished  the bottle i have is definitely smokey and spicy the iodine is there and not just hinted and a bit of sweetness and fruit on top i am a bit surprised for the comparision with caolila above i don t agree it is a nice one but ledaig follow another philosophy but everyone is entitled to their opinion yet that recommendation of airing the bottle is a good one not just for this one mine tasted a lot better when about 1 3 had been consumed water definitely needed else one would go numb with the 46 alcohol even so my recommendation is no more than about a 20 25 water not to dilute the experience too much ledaig is completely outstanding for the price  lots of beautiful smoke there s a lovely gentle peat smoke on the palate which combines with a dark charred oak and coal smoke on the palate before both merge together for a delicious finish amongst this there is a deep rich complexity and warmth black pepper spice seaside air and iodine are the most prominent but give this time and you ll begin to get some great mellow fruity notes too fantastic complex tasty and un chillfiltered wonderful  ledaig 10 reminds me of isle of jura releases ledaig 10 is better than isle of jura superstition though worth checking out jason s scotch reviews i m struck by how similar the style is to caol ila 12 y o but at a younger age apple smoke generally with a few drops of water to allow it to open up and open the bottle for air a day or two before you sample it the day i brought it home it was slightly disappointing 2 days later i loved it as i said delicious  what a difference between this and the old style this is 46 and unchillfiltered which probably explains some of it but this has a good oily body much more peat and smoke some medicinal notes but finishing on pepper and salt water creates a bit more sweetness but doesn t really diminish the mouth feel 
2595.0, delightful 2021 batch amazing so complex and such a nice mix of flavours the oily campbeltown aspects mixed with almost speyside sherry notes awesome stuff  love this stuff add a good splash of water to let the fruit in spice burnt orange sea salt caramel bit of pine resin rosemary dipped in pineapple liqueur just kidding on the last one i think cheers  cut out all this pretentious crap this is unique a campbelltown malt clean taste not too sweet medicinal and magnificent all the advantages of islays bonded warehouse on seawall with look and hue of highlands nothing in the world better for the price these last 40yrs took me ages to get into this half a bottle but suddenly pow the toffee hit and fruit salad sweets finish hit me you can see why it s got a following delicious  bought this for christmas 2020 the rubbish one was undecided weather to open this or the dalmore cigar malt reserve i got licorice on the nose and dried grass its definately better for me with a few drops of water lots of oak and a slightly salty finish i don 39 t dislike but not sure if opened the correct bottle  recent standard bottlings have been variable in their quality and my last one was really disappointing would be careful before investing in one of these would maybe go for a independent bottling or a smaller batch springbank product my favourite whisky and one of the only bottles i couldn 39 t live without 2020 batch is very good  strong sulphur on the nose clears a little with aeration tasting viscous malt candied pineapple touch of rotten eggs the batch variance must be bad with the 15 they really should have been quality control my first springbank and perhaps last until they can get my trust back hazelburn 13 14 and kilkerrans are better buys over this yikes  this is absolutely not a beginner 39 s scotch it 39 s a little rough around the edges this whisky has a phenominal complexity bottled at the right proof 92 proudly not chill filtered and extra full bodied a real old time style whisky that makes you think about the wild west and rough guys getting in bar fights in the 19th century yeah it costs alot in the us if you can find it but this is kind of a unique product on the market and i am a retailer sitting on 4 bottles of this precious single malt and if no one buys it i will drink it all  a little disappointed with this one i had a bottle of this about 5 months ago and it was sublime this latest batch bottle isn t a patch on that first one shame as i d come to expect more from this distillery i d say it s a lot thinner than the one i had before less resinous which was a part of my original joy  the fragrance which develops around the palate immediately after swallowing the nectar is deep and complex and unforgettable  a true classic and exemplifies the campbeltown style this is really good stuff but might not be to everyone 39 s taste it 39 s complex smoky and has that campbeltown funk this is more to do with the way the stills are heated than a late cut slightly salty slightly creamy slightly fruity good balance of sherry and bourbon casks impressive  i see what the fuzz is about nosewise but the finish screams a very late cut lots of sulfur compounds wet dog metal and blood  i believe many 15yo out there are underappreciated and this is one of them love it the first time i tried it don 39 t know much about making flowery tasting notes but i like it  a distillery that do everything from malting to bottling onsite and it results in a whisky that is head and shoulders above any other 15 year old beautiful stuff  lacking in smell and flavor right after opening but i know that a week after opening it comes alive i let the first glass sit for hours then i add water and wait so least 15 mins when you know how to handle this one you will be rewarded this could explain the negative comments  after visiting the distillery last summer we tried 12 15 18 and 26 i think but 15 was by far best  among the best 15 y o ever and even better than many 18 y o whiskies creamy pears with a gentle sourness that unique springbank touch which makes me fall in love with the distillery develops here both vibrantly and mature simply don 39 t have any criticisms about the dram not a single one  simply exquisite  the reviews about this one are completely wrong i had a second opinion on it so it wasn 39 t just me out of all the description of the nose the only thing that was true was leather and old rope i know whisky can be a personal thing from nose to taste and this will be sure to be someone elses favourite dram i just think the description that sold this to me wasn 39 t true it 39 s a shame i was so excited to try this one the bottle could last a while  i like this run no sulfur and fairly complex for a springbank 15 ob at only 46 you 39 ve got to watch out with the 15 it can run into some obnoxious sulfur depending upon the run there 39 s no telling which run mom will get in next  this is such a fantastic whiskey it s complex and bold with notes of smoke minty pine candied fruit spices and sweet cream incredibly unique and very easy to drink too will always have a bottle on my shelf  i would sell my mother 39 s eyes for a bottle of this nectar please don 39 t tell my mother  this has blown my mind a little i love a well sherried whisky and don t dabble too much with peated whiskies what we have here however is a whisky that starts off with mellow smoke but finishes with sweet sherry absolutely delicious and will hopefully satisfy all tastes it 39 s a amazing 15yr need some time to open up but when it 39 s ready it 39 s all you need creamy fruity spices lovely my first springbank and it 39 s not the last first very similar taste profile to the 10 yo as a 15 yo whisky it is sweeter rounder with a very oily texture which actually reminds me the macallan sienna for a bit but the complexity is from another planet i just had a glass so far i will need time to fully enjoy it i guess i am looking forward having another glass tonight  an immense deep unique whiskey a 15 year old really at the top sip after sip a pleasure  a wonderful whisky that just deserves peace and time to enjoy it fully sweetness with a kick honey and caramel with a bite i always pour a glass after choir practice just the thing to sooth the vocal chords and reflect on a good sing goes well with a good book too  probably one of the best 15yo whiskies out totally different monster from the 10yo old friction burned ropes on an old ship with a touch of tcp this is a dram you really need time to sit down explore  needs a little time to open up full bodied quot chewy quot if that makes sense very complex delicious  great long lasting finish of sherry and spice a lovely drop christmas cake hints of maple sugar need to get another bottle excellent stuff  cinnamon spicy musky vegetal note light smoke sweet rich fruits just lovely  creamy salty spicy sweet nice subtle sherry influence well rounded and balanced the finish is a lovely dark chocolate and nuts  amazing product top of the line if you like sherry matured  make sure that it is aerated well before you taste and leave for 10 minutes in the glass it has great balance with a most complex nose mom price is expensive compared with my local supermarket where it retails for gbp 53 00 and is available elsewhere online at gbp51 00 refined and full of campbeltown character  trying to be positive about this one but it 39 s not great on the nose raisins some soapy notes and an acrid perfume bringing to mind vomit amp flowers yep vomit i 39 ve had this bottle about 2 weeks now and left it open hoping to clear this up but it 39 s persistent on the palate yeah a little bit of vomity acidic bite along with some sweetness complete dud of a bottle if you ever threw up in your mouth and thought quot that wasn 39 t so bad quot this could be the whisky for you so my advice would be to purchase it somewhere you can try before you buy maybe if you find a good taster the other bottle in the batch will be good  returned from uk yesterday with a 50ml taster was shocked that i smelled bowmore when i poured the glass thought it had been mislabeled tastes nothing like the springbank 12 to me if this one gets categorized as an islay from cambeltown it gets troubling to categorize at 100 bottle i won 39 t be returning to this misplaced dram  i have to agree with a reviewer who said that on blind tasting he could have mistaken it for an islay malt has that delicious sootiness mifune eg  can 39 t praise this dram enough slight soot complex finish and some sublime sweet notes tobacco and new leather mixed in  from a neat pour the nose was initially light and floral with a honeyed sweetness hints of oats and digestive vanilla and salted caramel as it opened up more notes came forth late harvest raisins tropical salad banana creme soft buttered pretzel and candied lemon zest the palate lacked something definitive it was surprisingly thin yet oily with a quick muddled taste of oak and spice shrouded in a sulphured maltiness that flashed into an extra long and minty finish i know batches can vary and this was honestly nothing like the last springbank 15 i liked several years ago the menthol on the finish was a new note that i don 39 t normally associate with springbank this sample was a tad bit heavy in the first fill sherried influences and lacked the core nuttiness and peat kissed characteristics i love undeniably springbank and always an enjoyable dram but this was a new experience altogether  thanks i 39 m sitting here writing this at a hotel where a 2 5 oz pour of this stuff is only 17 us i have been wanting to try this one for years but i haven 39 t been willing to pull the trigger on a 130 bottle without at least trying it once tonight i got my chance and let me tell you this is fantastic stuff to me it 39 s really barking up the same tree as a highland park 18 in that it 39 s got a delicious blend of rich sherry and mild peat smoke unlike highland park however this stuff is bottled at 46 and it 39 s non chill filtered which actually gives it a mouthfeel that is superior to highland park anyway if you like that sherry mild peat blended flavor do not be the least bit afraid to pick up a bottle of this like i was i regret that i didn 39 t try it sooner it 39 s top notch scotch and very classy  this is a delicious malt being relatively new to whisky this is probably the most complex whisky i 39 ve had so far it 39 s quite incredible how much you can get out of this bottle simply just by giving it some time in the glass and just a drop or two of water can 39 t wait to try out some more bottles from springbank  great tasting notes on this campbeltown gem chaps from a neat pour every note listed above is spot on sometimes i can find a few different nuances coming thru in a tasting but this springbank 15 is everything above in a buttery smooth well balanced package  buying this whiskey at a super price was the first suprise 38 gbp second was how acurate the tasting notes from m o m are spot on getting nose notes of the traditional fruit salad sweets of old tutti fruiti bubble gum pinapple is there although not so obvious tiny hint of lavender slight peat influence palate peat slight tar pear rhubarb and custard sweets really well balanced full flavour finish is smooth and rewarding recommedable  great cask influence i always come back to try and chase more flavors very complex but not too dense slightly peated good sherry notes take your time with this one very rewarding maybe not so for beginners  complex and traditional there s so much going on smoke peat ever so slightly sherried all the descriptions read below and more what is remarkable is the layers don t clash but kind of weave in and out you will pour a second glass to try and catch what s going on very good indeed a tad expensive but you certainly get what you pay for although the bottle wont last long  when you get a good batch for me a darker vatting this is top notch 90 points  you may have just found it the springbank has been a coveted distillery for whisky lovers for many years and this is the distillery s sweet spot the 15yr reaches that perfect balance on all fronts aroma mouthfeel palette and finish are never overpowering endlessly intriguing and not easily forgotten this is what great scotch is all about  i have never tasted a whisky that marries wonderful sweet and very rich flavors with darker flavors of peat mild though slight brine leather and tobacco smoke just mind blowing every time i love this whisky but i love complex whiskies this will not hit you like a traditional islay but it will be more challenging than your balvenie or macallan but that s what i like it a little from both sides of the world  certainly a lot of complexity to this one that much is true got lots of the leather and old ropes on the nose as well as a bit of fresh sawdust not so much on the fruits though there was hint of the caramel mentioned the main issue i had was that it was a little over board on the alcoholic smell i got to the subtleties eventually but it initially hit me like whiffing a bottle of rubbing alcohol the body was a bit light as well bit of sugary oatmeal in the taste as well overall a light bodied scotch with a wallop to it not to my taste but certainly not bad by any measure would be a good one for a summer evening  this is truly an excellent whisky as others have intimated it has the sweetness and purity of a good speyside and a good deal of the smoke from an islay bunahabhain for instance i have to say this is certainly one of the most approachable malts i ve tried in recent months and also one of the most enjoyable for the price this is a superb everyday within moderation lol or even gifting whisky any recipient would be pleased to get this excellent  i love the smooth sherried style whiskies like the macallan and i love the smokey islay style even more to me this whisky feels like the nearest one can get to a harmonious marriage between the two a fabulous dram at a reasonable price  for me this is the ultimate dram just the right amount of sherry ageing with a hint of brine and sam brown belts coats the mouth fully an absolute belter 
9459.0, i have not had a glass of this in a long long time but it is one of my all time favourites i used to buy it in duty free when it was available an outstanding whiskey but not easy to find  i had this a few years ago on holiday with my wife i had one sip and i was in heaven this is one of the best single malts you will find anywhere in the world there is so much flavour to explore you will get different tastes with every sip you take absolute perfection  beautiful smooth a classic  love it so much that i bought a bottle for my son in law 39 s christmas present my new years resolution is that my first bottle of whiskey i buy in 2021 will be bushmills 16year old  bought for me as a xmas present from my top irish friendsit s soooo gooood very smooth beautiful  outstanding presented to me on fathers day the nose is of honey and nougat with a sweet spice malty finish i love this i will nurse this bottle as long as i possibly can  i bought this on the back of all the reviews below and am very glad i did so it really is a terrific whisky i had the fortune of trying the 21 yo also excellent but think i actually prefer this one highly recommended  in terms of nose and taste the bushmills 16 year old is up there with the 21 year old but slightly less expensive taste is subjective but it 39 s hard to find fault with this expression or any one of the bushmills range  one of the best whiskey i ever had starting from the noise it impressed me completely the palate is a balanced mix of spices and fruits and finish is absolutely smooth and stunning a must try and i highly recommends it  this is a whiskey this is just a whiskey  the nose is pleasant but light and does not really cast a spell on you in anyway the palate improves matters as it has a jammy taste with a lot of those dark fruits coming to the fore the finish is decent but not particularly long lasting what affects this whisky for me and the reason why i won 39 t be back for a second bottle is mouthfeel it is really thin one of the thinnest i have ever experienced and gives the finish a watery complexion due to this it lets down what would be a really solid whisky well still is a solid whisky but it could be so much moreit if wasn 39 t for that mouthfeel  a delicious smooth whiskey filled with all the flavours i love on offer at 163 75 is a good deal although i wouldn 39 t pay the full 163 100

son loves this whiskey he says that only the 21 year old bushmills can beat it hope it comes back again especially as the 21 year old version is so pricey  don 39 t 39 arf get you drunk  being from a big producer i expected this whiskey to be all mouth and no trousers but i was wrong smooth mellow yet full of flavour this whiskey is infinitely sippable and fandangos on the palette the label lies though the finish is mango all day long  lovely full bodied whisky fills the mouth and smooth lingering finish still on sale in cyprus 2016 i got this from my for my birthday on the 28th i have heard of the all around great taste of this amazing 16year i can 39 t wait to try it as i have always been an avid bushmills drinker  apart from being a very good whiskey the company either by pure luck or a calculated effort has managed to provide a closure being cork in this case that actually fits the bottle perfectly as opposed to 95 of other manufacturers well done bushmills and take note you other quot shortcutters quot  for a 40 alc vol i would generally steer clear in this case the whisky has retained the necessary body and flavour that normally requires a higher strength all i can say is what a damn shame it is so hard to get as i grabbed the last 2 bottles that were available in a local melbourne liquor store in closing quot epic quot grab it if you can  for years i tried to understand the fuss over scotch whisky i have found heaven in a bottle the irish way my sister returned from ireland and presented me with the 12 reserve and the 16 year olds excellent from start to finish the 16 is flawless  blue cheese amp sultanas hit you as soon as you take this into your mouth its light bodied juicy amp sweet from the sherry casks with spicy wood notes which make your mouth tingle from the bourbon casks then you get chocolate tonka bean amp vanilla as you swallow it leaves your palate feeling slight dry amp your tongue with a warm sun kissed glow  the best i ever had  then this is it it 39 s absolutely delicious and just spooky smooth on the finish i 39 ve never had an irish whisky or any scotch bourbon canadian nothing with the quot what was that quot smooth factor and incredible achievement  this is the smoothest and cleanest sip i have ever experienced  i have tried bushmills in the past and i was left happy but not impressed in any significant way but after having this bottle i am to say the least amazed i came to me under high recommendations by a local distributer it was so complex smooth and i would say soothing it definitely reminded me of my first whiskey with my old man so many years ago maybe this was it and i plan on savoring the next bottle with him  one of my favorite irish whiskeys great flavors and very unique taste i started drinking 16 several years ago after years of working my way up from old bushmills through black bush and 10 here in the western us i find few irish drinkers scotch and american whiskey and bourbon are big when introducing others to 16 my come on is quot are you a scotch bourbon etc drinker quot when the answer is quot yes quot my reply is quot not anymore quot and i offer a glass of 16 when they try it their expression is pure pleasure i 39 ve converted so many over the years i think bushmills owes me a commission  as others have said this knocks spots of the 21 year old and it 39 s half the price no brainer best bushmills by far  tasted it on irish bar in dk expected a lot from bushmills 10y and 16y palate honey vanilla smooth creamy and then cat piss vanilla nothing death finish maybe irishmen should not tripple distilled there whiskey now i much more prefer whisky  for its price ok glad to see the end of the bottle bit of a harsh bite to her invest a little extra for some black bush  enjoyed 2 3 of a bottle with and at my neighbours last night having seen the price i 39 m feeling guilty that i helped to demolish what turned out was a present from his wife oops  this is amazing drink i can drink it every day wow this is real taste recommend  i didn 39 t find anything special here it 39 s somewhere between a glenlivet 18 and an aberlour tomatin 18 without being as good as any of them it 39 s got a bit of an antiseptic taste to it similar to glenlivet but not as spritely much darker like the latter two the 21 is one of my all time favorites but this one just didn 39 t do it for me it 39 s not bad it 39 s just not something i 39 d personally get again  this to me is the best in irish whiskey to date much smoother than 10 year old with a more full bodied tast nice colour too a must very smooth whiskey with a great color and nice sweet notes  i bought this as i just loved the beautiful colour in the bottle when i tasted it i couldn t believe just how delicious it was it may not suit all palates but is worth a try for the serious malt enthusiast who will try more than one brand  after visiting the distillery and being disappointed with the 10 and 12 the sales person knew i was interested in nose and palate together since the others only provided one or the other bingo this even provides a very nice finish and is affordable to boot i am enjoying it right now and and thrilled to have such a great new whiskey seriously very pleased  very smooth and balanced a little light on the palette not as creamy as i would like but the finish is exceptional i rate it extra star just because of the price quality ratio  smooth with vanilla honey and port notes very smooth finish best irish whiskey i ve tasted so far  perfecto en todos los sentidos una maravilla de olor sabor paladar etc was looking to get myself a bottle of this after such rave reviews but although i usually always order from mater of malt its a full 10 pound cheaper on the whiskey exchange website don t know why the price difference for the same product is so different shame i have to order from elsewhere best bushmills whiskey by a long way forget the 21yo buy two bottles of this instead i taste peach vanilla toffee dried fruits its just the port and sherry that blast it into space old enough and young enough to be in that perfect place this and lagavulin 16 the only two whiskies you ever need to drink again  i m not a fan of irish whiskey however this one is worth every cent amazing thick full bodied mouth feel and intense fruit tones  best value whiskey around love the flavor i just want to keep on sipping but i will make a fool of myself if i do  can t get much better a great great whiskey just a hair under the 21 year old in terms of taste but it s much much better value and my preferred drink eyoooo to the limivady crowd i m from carrickfergus really good stuff very smooth with a lot of flavour  what a stuff its unreal defo one of the best malts so so smooth u can even try add a bit of water for even more depth and flavour class came on here looking for some of you guys opinions before i bought and what did i stumble upon someone talking about my wee town of limavady above haha drunk it on hols in limavady been looking for it with out success back in scotland well worth the price  this whiskey is simply wonderful to try it s really hard to imagine from the tasting notes here but i assure you it is well worth giving a go it s packed full of flavour sweet and fruity with a wonderful warmth  wow didn t expect to enjoy this as much as i did superb tasting single malt irish whiskey that stands up to his scotch cousins easily creamy mouthfeel and bursting with flavor and a longish distinctive finish my current favorite whiskey  one of the best tasting and most enjoyable whiskies i ve ever drank highly recommende super smooth  my favourite
2525.0, smooth as glenlivet is with oak heavy finish but like the double oak 12y not big in depth certainly not a memorable dram extremely approachable and drinkable though  best i 39 ve ever had  this is one of the malts i keep going back to really enjoy the influence of the french oak casks color is a deep gold amber nose is fruity i get raisins and ripening apples oak is rich on the palate i can taste dried fruits cinnamon but not overpowering finish is where i think this one shines i thinks so anyway nice long dry finish peppery honey sweetness comes through a bit more oak at times some caramel leaves a long lasting satisfying flavor despite have a medium body feel only wish that abv was a bit higher  my favourite speyside sofar pure oak no sherry port or other winey nonsense let it sit in the glass for 15 minutes but take a smell every now and then and notice how it wakes up from the classic speyside fruity sherry smell it evolves to a lively explosion of wood vanilla toffee tobacco banana and so on  reminds me of cognacobviously the influence of the french oak casks reading the reviews it sounded like i wrote the one on the 31st august 2020 well if not absolutely an everyday go to cleanser that beats the 18 year per 163 only other 5 stars i can give is the glendranoch 18  poured and left in the glass for 15 minutes this stuff is absolutely lovely nothing to dislike the french oak is very nice i miss the smokiness of islay whisky however its a great everyday whisky  the glenlivet 15 year is my favorite single malt bar none i drank the glenlivet 21 year archive for a while several years ago but the 15 year beats it in taste and smoothness a real first class scotch whisky keep it coming  my absolute favorite an absolutely neat drink flavor is unique and delicious thank you glenlivet  my favourite whisky is the glenlivet 18 however value for money this beats it s great whisky at a great price  ahhhh yes  i am a huge fan of the glenlivets all of them this is my favorite quot everyday quot version it is very smooth and the quot oaky quot flavor comes through with the spices showing all through out the experience with a wonderful end just perfect  nose clear grapefruit very clear palate orange chocolate on the end which is leftover after a whirlwind of grapefruit after very light wood spice with a slight spur that blinks the whiskey out of its existence in your mouth  given thus as an xmas present just opened and really enjoying it very smooth last finish subtle fruit flavours and inner warmth excellent a bit too light for my pallet well structured and fruity though  as always you could spend more and in many cases much more but why wonderful use the xtra money for a great cigar took a taste with a water by loved the finish in the mouth was tingly and slightly fruity i am used to a peaty smokey scotch but i believe i have been smitten by the 15 year a thankyou to the master crafter i will buy the 15 year again  a wonderfully smooth spirit with a fruity body and a very pleasant sweet finish definitely a cut above southern comfort or jim beam and totally worth the additional cost roughly double  i enjoyed it very much beautifully smooth scotch one of my favorites  lot 39 s of lovely flavours in this and very smooth too almost tastes irish rather than scotch has had a big price hike recently though which is disappointing  if there 39 s anything better i can 39 t afford it instantly fell in love and would make it my go to scotch but i have to fall back on monkey shoulders yes it 39 s a blend but a damned good one when i 39 m feeling cheap  smooth worth for the price dont go with the negative comments here  the 15 is the sweet spot for glenlivet you could spend more but hard to think you could do much better in love with it for years amazing value this really is just outstanding so smooth and complex make mine a double  wrong is there not a slight note of honey  never met a glenlivet i did not like likely this one is the best bang for the buck on the market you 39 ll spend a lot to improve upon this fine single malt  at this price point don 39 t know if you can get anything better simply outstanding  one of smoothest whiskeys i have ever had don t listen to any of the negative comments and try for yourself you won 39 t be disappointed  very smoooth i m sipping it as i finish a building a dining room table for my wife perfect finish for the night  nice and smooth i was pleasantly surprised this was also my introduction to glenlivet  incredibly smooth one of the best in this price range  the person who said this tastes like elmer 39 s glue was obviously sniffing glue not drinking this fine scotch if there 39 s anything better i can 39 t afford it  i 39 ve been meaning to try this for years but never got around to it i get a nice heavy cherry and oak smell and the flavor is spiced with bitter cherry oak and butterscotch smooth as butter with a spicy peppery finish sweet but not too sweet bit harsh at the very end though sears the tongue  after reading the reviews i was excited for this one ended up tasting like paint and elmer 39 s glue  this is probably the nicest malt i have tried to date ive searched for many years to find a malt i can truly say i love taste amp price important well this it it well done glenlivet ticks all my boxes if anyone loves me out there well this is indeed my perfect christmas birthday present  glenlivets can be amazing or good none are bad 12 year is a nice affordable dram but add 3 years and you 39 re on to a winner this is a superb winter whisky with all the right notes for sharing with an old friend or converting a new one only down side its awfully morish very smooth with a nice taste on the pallet no peat and a pleasure to sip as well as drink in larger swallows first let me start by saying this is like nectar me amp the wife both had 2 glasses the night i opened it she s not a huge oak fan but she enjoyed it it s slightly sweet but still got enough bite amp spice to warm you up it was as smooth as i expected amp had a nice complexity to it without overdoing it at the same time definitely going to be in my home bar collection  like velvet smooth on the palate and not a hint of harshness in the finish delicate but rich taste with a pleasant mouth feel quite lovely but lacking the extraordinary sparkle for a 5 star so amazing one of the best i had the 12 and liked it got the 15 and loved it tried both the 18 and 21 y o and came back to the 15 simply pleasant  i have always loved the 12 year old version of the glenlivet however after tasting this 15 year old expression it has rapidly become my favourite very smooth with a lovely warming finish to it one to savour  probably the best dram for the money i have had the oak adds a pleasant but different flavor worthy dram  maybe the best single malt i 39 ve ever tasted a complex but still pleasing palate hints of caramel and some subtle fruit flavors just the right amount of smoke does not taste like an ashtray it is pleasantly smooth has no bitter aftertaste and is just a pure pleasure it 39 s why i drink whiskey and not gin taste better then whiskeys costing twice as much i wholeheartedly endorse this fine scotch  as a relative newby to the world of whisky i 39 ve settled on the glenlivet 15 as my favourite this is a delightful whisky sweet fruity nutty and a wee spicy kick at the finish worth every penny and even better as i picked it up at a reduced price in sainsburys 163 33 would happily pay full retail price the bottle isn 39 t going to last long  spices toasted oak brandied chocolates and oaky notes would expect a higher abv at 15 years a smooth dram in keeping with the glenlivet expressions  definitely one of the best scotch whiskies i 39 ve had i 39 ve paid much more for worse quality very smooth with a nice vanilla spice taste at the finish great price and very good quality  at nearly 5 stars i was not disappointed by the rating or the taste this is a fine balance of smoke fruit vanilla perhaps none overbearing or offensive this is one of the few scotch whiskies i 39 ve had that is worth what it costs and worth more than some i 39 ve had that cost twice the price  so so close to being great 40 abv hurts it a bit vanilla and banana at first with a good woody cinnamon finish adding a touch of water doesn 39 t really help aroma or taste  for whatever it 39 s worth i 39 m a long time lead guardian of the chapter of glenlivet guardians where i live really this just means i get to enjoy glenlivet on a regular basis gratis so i 39 m very well acquainted with not only their core range but some of their more uncommon bottlings too of all the expressions i 39 ve sampled i keep returning to the 15 again and again i have a large collection of whisky at home and the only glenlivet i have is the 15 two liter sized bottles this expression has a terrific balance of fruity sweetness a hint of spice nuttiness and a smooth round character that the 12 doesn 39 t quite achieve and the 18 frankly overshoots i like all the whiskies in the glenlivet core range with the possible exception of the nas founder 39 s reserve have tasted it several times will never buy that one but the 15 is the standout for me both for its taste and character and for its price to quality ratio much cheaper than the 18 and for me a more enjoyable scotch to drink too easy to sip neat or with a chip of ice it 39 s chill filtered as far as i know and just 40 abv so neither a need nor a benefit to add water imo rated 4 5 stars for the whisky in relation to the price i pay for it  i really like this scotch smooth and the finnish is long and great tasting  very good very smooth smooth if you love scotch  like many i 39 ve tried other glenlivets but not the 15 fifteen years is an awkward age for a malt halfway between the affordable quot honest quot 12 and the indulgent full bodied 18 for some perspective my affordable drams are singleton 12 royal lochnagar 12 or even dewar 39 s ancestor 39 s quot true scotch quot 12 which i heartily recommend after a couple of doubles in a proper glass i find the glenlivet 15 too sweet too one dimensional with no contrasting 39 bite 39 to tingle the cheeks it almost feels like an 18 with the heart ripped out or a deluxe whiskey  decent scotch doesn 39 t offer a great range of flavour  new to scotch have tried 3 different brands before this one i see no reason to search any longer very smooth really enjoyed it  smooth going down and has a nice after taste one of the best scotches i 39 ve ever had  i 39 ve had the glenlivet 18 which i felt was just okay the 15 is pretty good it 39 s great value paid half of what the 18 is priced at it 39 s very smooth and easy to drink initially it reminded a bit of a bourbon until i got into it lots of interesting flavors and sweet without being overly sweet  it 39 s a very good dram best for the price in the glenlivet series very tropical in the flavours but the nose doesn 39 t deliver that much though that 39 s why only 4 5 sweet on the nose with tobacco notes taste reminded me of a cigar but not the smoky taste the taste of the tobacco itself no alcohol burn very snooth my dad and brother swear by it and after a few good has a great taste from the beginning to the end  can 39 t beat the price for a 15 year old single malt but needs atleast 43 abv  n fresh and honey sweet floral notes and some lemon t vanilla oak malty but not to sweet f drying nicely with some spice more floral notes and some pepper verden good balance lacking some intensity due to low alcohol strenght my rating 91 100eyvind taraldsen thick with marzipan apple and cinnamon on the nose a big hit of toffee apple on the palate with overtures of raisins and christmas cake hardly any burn but peppery on the finish very nice dram  i normally drink glenlivet 12 yr old but bought this one last week i found this malt so beautifully smooth i shared it with my partner who normally drinks macallan but no more he has drank malt for 50 yrs and said this was his favourite now and thanked me for introducing him to it high praise indeed strong oak nose and taste when drunk neat sweet and complex flavor when diluted slightly with water  very nice flavour and taste  would rather have this 15 aged in oloroso sherry casks would bring out so much more in nose and flavor should also be bottled a 43 or better while we are at it non chilled filtered and no color added the oak just seems to prevent this from being so much better than it could be it smothers the style glenlivet has come to be known for this 750m will sit for some time until it oxidizes in the bottle for something a little more ideal hoping it happens  got my wife a bottle for her 50th birthday nice amp smooth  first time i had this was kinda disappointed and felt that the 12 year was much better but trying it again right now and i am liking it quite a bit similar apple flavor to the 12 year but with a bit more rich oak and cinnamon and very smooth i can imagine drinking many glasses of this stuff i honestly prefer glenfiddich 39 s 15 year more just a lot fruitierand a better finish but this is actually really good and very smooth worth the money for sure the sugarbear really smooth can t stand glenfiddich unable to find in duty free in miami or bermuda in bermuda retail has no 12 15 or 18 year old 18 have not seen yet  i 39 ve had older but for my money this is as good as it gets incredibly smooth not too fruity perfect amount of sweetness with a bit of spice love this single malt  i completely agree with the below review there is nothing wrong with it at all yet it needs something a bit more to make it great for me that extra something is a bit more kick only 40 and a better mouthfeel as it is a bit too thin on the palate for me but overall great value for the money fantastic taste and it is indeed very smooth and mellow probably aided by the low abv  this malt greets the nose with a cool spiced apple foreground with yule spices and woody notes dancing in the background on the pallet i find a mellow yet very present array of spices brought on with a pleasant oak note the finish is long pleasant overall a good dram yet it leaves me wishing for a bit more flavor  great taste best in this price range  probably my favourite single malt within this price range smooth good burn as it trickles down  might as well be 3 month bourbon great with dahl and rice very nice a lot of flavors involved  pretty good and smooth scotch  can 39 t believe the quality of this speyside it 39 s so smooth and so woody caramely it 39 s beautiful  i decided to venture out of the 12 39 s and bought the lagavulin 16 and glenlivet 15 out of the two enjoyed the glenlivet much more smoother and more caramelized flavor and a smokey taste the lagavilin was a bit smokier and not as smooth but tasty nonetheless  can 39 t believe the quality of this speyside it 39 s so smooth and so woody caramely it 39 s beautiful  the glenlivet 12 is a nice undemanding dram it 39 s simple smooth and well crafted all of which is true for the 15 there is a bit more wood and a touch of red fruits to both the nose and palate but that 39 s about all that sets the 15 apart from the 12 there really isn 39 t much added complexity or flavor profile for the extra money the 15 costs save your money and buy the 12 spend a bit more and get the 18 or try something more challenging from another distillery  i usually stick to macallan 18y quite pricey and glenmorangie lasanta and was giben the glenlivet 15y as a present thoroughly enjoyable very smooth but not boring at all highly recommended given the fair price well done glenlivet  i love its taste and enjoy drinking it isn 39 t that what one wants in a scotch an easy drinking sweet oaky malt with a medium long finish i prefer it to the 18 year old it 39 s really well priced too lovely all year round  cant say superb enough times well done glenlivet i drink this all the time quality  if you want to be sure that spending 50 on a bottle of whiskey is worth it buy this  love it it 39 s no lagavulin 16 but i definitely enjoy it amazing the description on the bottle is right on so worth the 50 better than the the belvanie 21 year  i love the flavor of this scotch it was a gift from a friend i 39 ll be buying more of this scotch in the future  best whisy in the world oak tannin amazingstyle of 12 years but much oakineas to flavourresinous gold colour with a nice finish of floralfinish is just like a nice sri lankan chutney with spiced cinnamon and cloves a delight for allfrom agnabagna ltdceylon sri lankajayanathan thimbananny one of my favorites if not my favorite i 39 m new to the whiskey world so not sure what i was going to get or what to expect i bought a bottle of glenlivet 15 and just find it so easy to sit and sip a lot smoother than i expected something about this whisky leaves me underwhelmed the 18 is fantastic and even the 12 is a lovely whisky but the 15 feels like it is missing a lot of flavour  it 39 s the only whisky my wife will drink and i love it too the only trouble is we spend so much of our time drinking this that i never get the chance to partake of my rarer more esoteric collection  hoping it to be good the best scoth whisky i 39 ve ever taste absolutely love it  my fave in my local bars absolutely a good acquaintance warm and gentle but still strong  one of the best malts goes well with my selection the oak makes all the deference love it from the first time i tasted it may 2015 it became my nr 1 whiskey the best so far this my favorite scotch in the price range i truly enjoy a glass of the glenlivet 15 after a long day just to sit and sip the full palate and creamy texture stays with a long time  for a 15 year i was hoping for more  this i tried and liked for me whisky is my occasional drink but looks nice in the glass and no harshness or bitterness you want a very nice and mellow tasting drink to warm you and with ref to james bond not shaken or stirred its just very smooooth i love my talisker 10 laphroaig 18 and macallan 18 and many others but not all whisky needs to blow you over the moon i was given a beautiful young arab horse once and was concerned i didn 39 t know enough to do him justice so i asked a friend with a lot of training experience what i should do he said quot it 39 s your horse just ride him quot it was great advice my review this is delightful and somewhat unique scotch for a fair price it 39 s your whisky just drink it and enjoy what it is  wonderful flavor greatest taste ever haven 39 t had 18 year or anything about the 15 year yet but the 15 is just most excellent damn good first glass however more delicious than the second by the time i got to the second i was so hammered i couldn 39 t appreciate it it was still great but the first taste wast the best i had the first one neat and the second one at the bartenders insistence quot opened up quot with water nope neat is better smooth and absolutely sumptuous too smooth it 39 s smooth and it 39 s oak and that 39 s about it if you don 39 t like the dry bitter oak taste don 39 t buy this i don 39 t dislike it it 39 s just not that engaging at 40 don 39 t expect it to open up a lot with water either a nice starter whisky to me not much else three stars nonetheless it 39 s still quality spirit at a reasonable price  a nice double shot and a good cigar is all that a real needs  this is my go to scotch for the end of the day it is also significantly better than its 12 year cousin enough to make the price difference worth it for daily sipping  every man worth his manhood should get a case today i had a great you know what  this 15 years waters my fearce appetite for a very unique cask i appreciate his sweetness with a hint of toffee and subtle peat i found it very balanced and refreshing  i prefer this one over glenlivet 18 very smooth rich taste tastes even better of left sit on a shelf for few weeks after opening if possible  this surprised me not overpriced in my opinion you 39 re getting a playful little scotch for just shy of 163 40 really love those oaken notes  an ordinary whisky that is slightly overpriced very surprised by richness a full bodied scotch that has many different notes of flavor  the 16 year is a very peaty scotch not for beginners of scotch but well adapt for those of us that enjoy a smoke flavor this scotch feature everything written above i enjoyed this bottle during the summer months because my 21st birthday was in august and usa drinking age is 21 even in summer i keep my ac high this scotch was so delightful warmed me up before going to bed and gave pleasant dreams it did remind me of apple crumb pie going from 12 year to this was a very different change but a positive one for me in specific i would recommend other to get this in the glenlivet tasting sample which includes a 12 15 amp 18 year 200ml each sample before buying the full 750ml bottle of the 15 i also enjoy very dark coffee with no cream and sugar and fell that my palette was more used to this pettiness than others liking enjoy your dram brandon niblett add me on facebook i would like more scotch loving friends  i ve given many of the family a try up to now the 15 french oak reserve is the quot all around best quot in the categories judged thank you i love every part of this whisky especially the finish last year i learned to drink and understand the tasting of whisky even went on a whiskytrip to the speyside and tried so many kinds but this is the one for me  i could take it or leave it i found it to be very single noted very smooth just not what i would expect from a single malt  some tasting notes leave me a bit cold apple crumble really there is definitely the influence of oak perhaps unsurprisingly but i don t get that much spice either not really its slightly peppery on the palate very smooth great with some ice or not and i think quite different but equally recommendable with either its very smooth and clean very different from an oily peaty laphroaig for example its reasonably straight forwards but its defining characteristic strangely enough is that of cognac id be surprised if cognac drinkers didn t find this an affable dram which should not really be any surprise either i have to say that it feels slightly processed 40 and not just simply a casks strength at 15 years with this provenance doesn t quite add up for me but what do i know its ok but i wouldn t rush out and pay this much again a great scotch for those who dislike peat and love brandy the two seem to go hand in hand in my experience  love it smooth rich and buttery velvety mouthfeel very balanced finally exactly what i had in my mind imagined as the perfect example of a non peated scotch  without a doubt this is one of my favs  one of my favourites an absolute cracker  tasted it fresh after twisting the cap and it compares to every bargain bin quot aged 3 year scotch quot i have ever had after snubbing my nose at it and pushing the glass far away i let it sit for about 4 hours before trying it again not bad at all but when i drink scotch i expect a flavor of some sort that i can distinguish especially a single malt and this has none there are definitely better choices out there but it is worth a taste for someone who like to try them all i do not recommend for beginners  smooth smooth smooth a couple cubes and you are set for a pleasurable sipping experience enjoy with a light cedary cigar or by itself i m sure the quot oak cask quot guy is messing around but his rating should be omitted consummers who are searching for their taste in scotch read reviews and look at ratings mostly so they don t spend money they don t have on something they won t like  i am new to scotch i am 24 and only have been drinking it about a year i have two favorites none the less aberlour abundah and glenlivet 15 they are both fantastic i agree with everyone else in the face that i cannot believe someone actually thought it would show up in a french oak cask that would be super badass but not going to happen most likely i guess you never know yes indeed i agree with the previous reviewers regarding the oak i opened the box to find a bog standard glass bottle of whisky rather than any sort of oak receptacle not a hint of wood here of any kind i have to say the whole oak thing did rather taint my whiskey and whilst i was drinking it my mind couldn t help but drift to the promised oak  beautiful dram which introduced me to the mighty glenlivet if this is your first bottle of malt you will not be sorry excellent i just received a bottle of the 15 year french oak expression for my 29th birthday how special a sip it is very elegant and perfect for any special moment to oneself  on the first night i tried this i wasn t as impressed but with my second dram the next evening i let it sit for about 5 minutes and it noticeably improved only wish it were a stronger proof but besides that it is a good drink if you re not in the mood for the peated stuff  to those that have been quot disappointed quot because this didn t come in an oak barrel the quot container quot is irrelevant it is what is inside that matters and glenlivet matters very much first this is an excellent dram but wait please pardon my sarcasm here the guy expect this whisky in a french oak not glass bottle my friend are you sure it s a scotch or maybe it s something else either way get lost and buy yourself a cheap beer or rum i love this guy french oak  i picked up a bottle of this to celebrate my grandfather s passing he wasn t a drinker but if he was i think he would have enjoyed this as it is just like him smooth and classy  started drinking whisky recently after my scottish grandfather passed away tried this as the glenlivet 12yr old was always a favourite i shan t be going back the 15yr old is much smoother with far more depth and complexity on the palate will stick with this as an everyday tipple  mhm  i ve never quite got on with the smith s glenlivet it s always been a tad disappointing but i suppose it is a good whisky which doesn t appeal to me it doesn t have any outstanding features the bouquet is ordinary and my palate can t find much to distinguish it perhaps it s just me whisky tasting like anything else involving judgement can be very subjective even so i d give it 3 stars  this is a very complex whisky a very good winter whisky lots of spice and subtle sweet flavors of english candies after dinner biscuits and fruits i don t know how the mongoloids got a hold a bottle i know they re joking about it coming in a barrel or hating the color of the box packaging is nothing to do with the quality of the whisky i rely on reputation and reviews i seldom walk in and grab something i ve never heard of before keep the trolling on facebook kiddies and the scotch drinking to real men  i like just about everything it has no peat more mellow as anything i have ever had great  i have had the joyous privilege of having the 15 year old half french half scott young lady attend thanksgivings christmases and new years parties as the brits would put it she is a social bird as a veteran oif and oef she helped the sea stories of a sailor just seem a little funnier and cherish the company of the closes friends and family she is a lady that should assist in the warmest celebrations my birthday is on 9 24 83 and she has been cordately invited to attend   quot as good as it gets without spending a fortune personally prefer islay but this 15 yr old from the 16 men of tain will do me until i die if needs be a hefty 92 on my richter scale quot having lived all my life 19 miles from the glenmorangie distillery where the 16 men of tain reside i was surprised to read the above review my ancestors are from the braes of glenlivet where the glenlivet 15yo is produced and this is a long way from tain as long as you enjoy the dram i don t suppose it matters if you have absolutely no clue as to where it comes from ps the name gives a very strong hint of its origins  i am a fairly young 50 i have been sneaking a wee dram since being a boy i have tried many fine and rare whiskys over the years and must admit this is a gem and a steal at the price i am sipping a glass and rolling the flavor around my mouth as i write simply superb my advice it treat yourself today the fun part is their are still so many to try  great whisky shame people have tarnished its ratings over a french oak cask which it is clearly not going to be bottled in  not specifically a complex whisky but it offers a decent experience lackluster for a 15 y o miles better than the 12 y o glenlivet light and floral a few drops of water go a long way here for a good speyside dram benromach 10 would be a better and cheaper alternative  one of the best single malts i have ever tasted great on the palate fruity and a beautiful finish   without spending a fortune personally prefer islay but this 15 yr old from the 16 men of tain will do me until i die if needs be a hefty 92 on my richter scale lmao at the quot didn t come in a french oak barrel quot oh crap i m out  the best single malt i have ever tasted i liked it better than some 18 y o extremely rare highland single malt super shall recomend it  a great citrusy and oaky experience great to get non scotch drinkers into single malts i have a hard time noticing any complexity when everythings this sweet but its truly a highly citrusy almost syrupy experience with just enough oak to remind you its a fine whisky and not a juice  took me a second tasting several days later to fully understand this malt it s delicious the finish slightly reminds me of lillet blanc i assume it s from the french oak very good scotch if you re looking for something without peat though i am a fan of peat  i enjoy a nice glass of glenlivet 15 every so often it s a good change up from my preferred drink i d recommend this malt to any scotch drinker  one step further i love how you described your experience with the single malt very descriptive made me go out and buy me a bottle at 163 31  i recently purchased a bottle of the glenlivet 12 it came with two dram bottles the 15 year old and the 18 year old i found that i preferred the 15 to the 18 it has a smoother finish in my opinion and the sweet buttery flavors of the wood come through for just a really pleasant overall experience this is relaxation in a bottle  tonight i as contemplating at my local store which aged spirit to partake in i thought quot single malt or single barrel quot i opted for for this one and at first took a deep breath and inhaled the sweetness of citrus cinnamon and smoked oak as i sipped the elixir i could taste the notes of resins nutmeg layered over a pure orange tangerine coating my tongue with a smooth oil which was in reminiscent of almond oil the finish lingered for a decent amount of time to hold me over between sips i will point out that i found greater satisfaction by placing my whiskey stoned in boiling water drying them and swirling them in the glass a light fog coated the interior of the glass bringing forth a more intense nose and a complexity to the pallet greater than before i recommend this to those who wish to have a decent experience at a decent price i got it for 45 usd it was going for 60 elsewhere but even at 60 its worth every penny i took half a star off because not only did it not come in a french oak barrel but they didn t even seem to reserve one for me the horror  great scotch but it did not come in french oak as it sounds like it does from the description  beyond excellent  please expedite the french oak whiskey a lot of stress here in the states i desperately need my old dependable friend  can the guy who found this at 17 34 a bottle please tell me where am on ma way wi the wheel barra noo having sampled this numerous times i also agree it s hard not to continue once you open the bottle a wee gem in a big industry  i did love the smoothness of this one great for dessert ps thumbs down on the botteling it did not come in an oak cask as stated p what the xd recommended  exquisite even if it didn t come in an oak cask d fools should stick to the cheap booze and leave the good stuff for those who can appreciate it  this is a winner some have compared this to jwb johnnie walker black and i made the sad same mistake glenivet 15 french resvere is far better smoother in taste this is very smooth to the palete a bit of smokiness a scotch for a muture man enjoy my friend  one of the nicest malts i have ever tasted so smooth no ice or water required phenomenal  ottimo gusto morbido al palato non alcolico alla gola prezzo ancora buono 34 euro in italiaaltri whisky molto superiori a 5000 sterline non sono così gradevoli read all the reviews and decided to treat myself to a birthday present went to my local store and found it at 17 34 yes 17 34 will be celebrating for 2 more birthdays keep yiur eyes peeled  i really enjoyed this spicy tobbaco taste once you open the bottle it will be hard to stop i give it a ten  had this a few months back and found it to be a great whiskey it is spicier then the 12 and 18 but a really good rich flavour this is one i ll keep in my collection and serve to impress though it does come in a glass bottle and not in a barrel it is very nice indeed he made my day when i read be ware does not come in oak barrel it came in glass bottle love this guy  for years a bourbon drinker recently appreciated single malt scotch was put off by the belnded ones all this time excellent dram it definately travells you to a world of relaxation after a long day  warm smooth oak fruity a real treat but beware sampling can easily lead to half the bottle great dessert whisky highly recomended for those who do not need peat smoke this is one for the special occasion i have just been reunited with an old friend what a treat to sit and sip a fine scotch and catch up on old times of course had i not of had my old friend here with me to share in this rather special little number my own company a wee dram would also be rather satisfactory he he  i would recommend you leave the fools comment but censor the star rating i almost didnt buy it because of 1 star review then i thought to myself is it possible not to like a 15 glenlivet jonnie warm smooth oak apple and cinnamon a real treat and a bargain be aware same idiot left a similar comment re the macallan fine oak 10yo we have a comedian in our midst  your site shouldn t even print such an absurd review did this idiot expect an oak cask in the box this is 4 5 star whisky all day long a classic big oak complex speyside bk from california  i too was greatly dissapointed when my 30 pound bottle of whisky did not arrive in a french oak barrel i was going to make a tidy profit selling the barrel later  loved the aroma wonderful flavour and smooth as silk highly recommend this malt  you should be careful when you buy this it does not come in french oak at all but in a glass bottle did not like the colour of the leather on the box at all 
64362.0, makes for a good mixer but isn t at all complex or smooth compared to many other single malts of a similar age a cask strength offering could be interesting but this feels like a liqueur too watery at 40 for the flavours to be meaningful enough  heavy on sulfur overpowers what could potentially be an interesting dram not recommended neat  simply an amazing everyday sipper  introduced to this by a friend who claims it is his favourite its very nice smooth easy drinking and i enjoy it with a wee bit of ice the chill the ice gives and the water as it melts opens this whisky with every sip a great nose of honey floral and oak slightly smoked the palate is spicy a little bit fruity and the aftertaste is decent length peaty and sweet a great whisky at a very affordable price  i agree with those who suggest this is best with water and for the money thats really what you 39 re buying for me it 39 s not going to be one that you 39 d serve as a dram but marry it with some ice and a good soda and you 39 ve got yourself something beautiful its almost like this whiskey needs the dilution to get the best from it i like whisky soda as an aperitif or just something to sip and watch the box with and for that it serves with distinction subtly malted a touch sweet and very very moreish  not too smoky but with enough richness of flavour to be well set off by a drop of water i used to be a speyside man and typically put off by overly strong peat and smoke flavours but lately forays with whiskeys like this have helped me appreciate the complexity of flavour it won 39 t be the finest whisky in the world but its definitely a cut above most really enjoyable and not so expensive you feel guilty splashing out a good measure whilst watching a favourite film  i have always been a peaty type of guy but this has totally changed my taste buds smooth and mellow whether over ice or on its own i cried when i finished the bottle  cheap and nasty sells for around 163 25 in the supermarkets and i still would not buy another bottle sweetish slight smoke cardboard new make spirit ultra short finish you get what you pay for but don 39 t imagine you are getting a 39 proper 39 12 y o malt for the same cash a bottle of jw black is a much better whisky or teachers  my daughter bought me bottle for my birthday would highly recommend lovely tasting one to note 5 star rating will buy again a very good and smooth tasting whisky very easy to drink  a great whisky a very smooth and drinkable whisky its worth buying just for the bottle and box  first glass of hp i ve not enjoyed pretty rough and tastes cheap save yourself a few quid a buy a bottle of famous grouse or some mouthwash not good  good stuff the people who dislike this probably can 39 t grow a beard  i was recently given a bottle of hp 12 yr old i have tried many whiskeys over the years and favour white horse bells famous grouse and jb hp 12 yr old is the smoothest yet with a lovely nose and slides pleasantly across the palate i will be choosing this brand wherever possible in future an exceedingly good whisky  i bought a bottle of this and it did not last long easy to drink slightly sweet and not too much fire lovely i don 39 t get those down rating this this is an amazing scotch with beautiful flavors my new go too with an encore or oliva cigar  i m a lover of islay whisky but to my surprise i am really enjoying hp viking 12 a excellent any time whisky bought for me by my son but i will definitely be buying the next bottle  well rounded easy drinker yet a nice balance of character fresh and floral on the nose some peat on the palate but i wouldn t say it s the main flavour might just my odd palate but i get a bit of neapolitan ice cream too  dont listen to the naysayers i think they are just trying to prove a point that they once drank the old hp12 and think they are too cool for school the new hp12 is simply delicious it is the go to whiskey if you looking to spend 50 bucks and be extremely happy with selection it almost tastes like a blend of the best non medicinal tasting peat fruit oak and heather honey its simply delicious a fantastic whiskey thank you highland park  what the hell is this supposed to be what an absolute mess this is i have drank flavoured water with more depth and flavour than this absolute dish water  nice clean whiskey that doesn 39 t give an immediate hangover like most others i 39 ve tried  good whiskey more peat honey and smoke would make it even better i purchased the 12 yr old viking honour and was extremely disappointed in it it gave a burning sensation to my throat and a bitter taste along with it i tried to find the usual pleasure one finds in a single malt scotch but to no avail after half the bottle was gone and my stomach burning with indigestion in the week or so i tried it i gave up and poured the remaining contents down the sink after avoiding any alcohol for a few days for the indigestion to clear up i went back to my regular the glenlivet 12 and enjoyment c e lawrence a decent whisky but unremarkable happy to drink it but wouldn 39 t go out of my way to find it  it 39 s good it 39 s very good infact short of excellent but very satisfying no complaints at all  listen to meno listen to me i know best they used the wrong wood this isn t land park vikings aren t real not as good as a mcdougle 14  when i tried this at a tasting i didn 39 t have huge hopes but those that i had were disappointed not really peaty sweet or that clean tastes much cheaper than it costs harsh and unrefined there are much better blends  great whisky and amazing value for the money looking forward to trying the 18 highland park is our sons favourite whiskey so nothing more need to be said  it is nice drink for me long time can not find it hopefully you bring it make me happy  i thought this was a lovely whisky for me an amateur when it comes to whisky it was a perfect drink beautiful  a wonderful addition to the highland park family  had a long day stressful journey home this is an ideal every day sipper to have in your collection or as a hip flask sip on those cold days walking on your well deserved day off  not enough depth in this whisky for me somebody else wrote that it was a bit thin and i agree not great  have drank the hp 12 year old for years this is not the same quality or taste seems a little thin rather like a young spirit and the smokiness seems like an afterthought however i like the honey and orange overtures and the pepper on the finish marketing is obviously for the gullible not a bad whisky but i ll only buy if it s heavily discounted  very smooth to drink neat leaves a really nice after taste  smell wise is absolutely gorgeous i could just smell this all day all honey and cream taste is peaty but higher more orange peel like than i usually go for peppery finish that 39 s mouth warm the spirt flavour is too much though in the taste it 39 s all bitter it 39 s okay 6 5 out of 10 wold drink it if offered again but wouldn 39 t buy it again i am going to drink this whole bottle though damn it smells so much better than it tastes i tell you what it reminds me of incense the heavy chapel kind you know what now i 39 ve placed it i think i like it better  the old 12 year old is what got me i to whisky easily discernible and pleasant honey taste with a lingering smoke finish i went on and tried other whiskies but still enjoyed the hp this version seems to have substituted taste for marketing blurb on the box its not bad but the key flavours now seem reduced and a spirit type flavour is more pronounced its ok but a real shame my reliable go to whisky is no more  never tried a highland park before and this was on offer i was expecting something a little smokier but the notes here are pretty accurate but it is quite subtle in every aspect quite drinkable but lacks any real depth very subtle sherry and fruit incredibly light pretty mediocre all round nice but can 39 t say anything more  im not an educated whisky taster i only recently started drinking whisky so still have a lot to try and learn at the moment i try a whisky i either like it or i dont this whisky i do like its easy to drink no harshness could easily sit and enjoy whilst relaxing not a special occasion whisky just a finished work had a long day feel like a dram great whisky for the price in reading many of these quot reviews quot all i can do is shake my head we all have our particular tastes and for many it is really great for some it tastes awful i like it it is a nice bottle for a low price is it as good as say a hp 18 or hp dark 17 year old no but it is also a fraction of the price if you want better spend more money if you are fine with a nice bottle of scotch that satisfies this is a good bottle for that  ignore the gold medals they mean nothing jw red also got a gold medal from the 39 judges 39 in fact all jw whiskies won medals so this hp viking honour is on the same level as jw red and that 39 s about right thin watery no way does it taste like a 12 y o ask yourself why it sells so cheaply amp supermarkets have to discount it to make a sale gotta laugh at people who pretend its good  tried one in an pub and decided never to buy a whole bottle and end it there fast forward a year or so and i have been gifted a bottle and found it more enjoyable as i get further through big blast of honey on the nose it has to be the most pungent orange ive had from a whisky and leads into peeper finishing with a pleasent sweetness sits very firmly at the 163 30 price tag but this price does have stiff competition for entry level supermarket drams maybe try it if you see it on offer  great whiskey gotta laugh at the people who swear it 39 s not what it was 20 years ago has nothing to do with your body slowing down lol don 39 t be ashamed happens to the best of us mildly dissatisfied at first it seemed to lack body of old and the honeyed heathery nose felt a bit contrived took a few drams from the bottle over a couple of weeks and then came back to it much much better rich and peppery with lovely caramelised orange fruit and a biscuit sweetness long on the palate too with oak peat and smoke  nice but seriously needs to be at 46 abv rich smokey flavour that isn 39 t overpowering delicious drank neat doesn 39 t need a mixer  what happened to this whisky it was always dependably good quality my last bottle was finished so i bought this one my initial reaction was that i 39 d been sold the wrong thing this just isn 39 t the excellent highland park i 39 ve been drinking for the last 20 years it tastes cheap had the 18 also tastes cheap i guess someone bought and ruined highland park  was one of my favourite malts and i could have said reduced to 40 it has watered down and killed it for me for what was once a wonderful malt but i 39 m convinced it 39 s just only the 40 that 39 s lost it for me it 39 s gone deeper than that it 39 s now entrenched in that group of companies that are killing scottish whisky 1 the vikings didnt drink whisky they died out in the 11c 200 years before the earliest date of spirits being distilled in the uk which is 700 years before hp even arrived in orkney so there is absolutely zero connection 2 the whisky viking honour is weak and lacks substance as if the stills were run too fast and maturation carried out in knackered casks uk supermarkets have to discount it to sell it this is why it has to be heavily marketed and branded because otherwise it wont sell  bought this at the local liquor store because i enjoyed reading the rich history on the packaging and loved the look of it brought it home and sipped on it neat it had a very smoky palate with a bit of spice on the lips long longer on the smoky taste it felt a little overdone on the smokiness won t be my go to but it wasn t a bad experience really nice fragrance  just love it i wasn 39 t really a whisky lover but a trip around the distillery changed that absolutely lovely experience cube of ice is all you need my husband bought this for my birthday as he does terrible things with whisky like putting coke in it 128580 so i have had it secreted and had just a dram now and again sadly the isolation got to me and it is no more 128549 i don 39 t know what wonders the low score reviews have access to but this is one of the best malts i have tasted that is in my budget and i will be having it again and again warm and smooth with a hint of fire at the back of the throat a delight on the tastedbuds and who cares if the vikings haven 39 t been on orkney for hundreds of years i can picture thor in valhalla as i am tasting this stuff 128521  great for the price will be buying again ye it s ok but rather go with the 18yr old much tastier  certainly seems to be one extreme to the other with this one i had a bottle and didn t notice anything amiss the bread the comments so bought another still tasted good compared it to other 12yr olds with better reviews and still more then holds its own i think it s partly people s dislike to the marketing and partly swayed by other reviews i don t think it s changed since the packaging changes and it s still a damn good dram for a very good price  solid whisky just love it  looks old fashioned and tired and cliched on the supermarket shelves always on offer really not the same whisky it used to be feels and tastes thin time for a new marketing team and a consolidation of the brand perhaps more focus on the core product instead of diluting the overall brand literally lost count of the different batches and gimmicky bottling and design  she offered her honourhe honoured her offerand all the night longit was honour and offerthe poem is better than the whisky and neither have anything to do with vikings who left orkney many hundreds of years before hp arrived  it is like a whipped whiskey most of the fight is gone and it speaks only when spoken to it has a creaminess that i don 39 t want in a whiskey and it is subtle enough for the blended scotch drinker or the non scotch drinker to feel welcome the price is deceptive it makes you think you are getting a premium single malt scotch but you are not  my first real peated whiskey subtle but nuanced i enjoyed this thoroughly picked it up cause of positive reviews and i thought the labeling was interesting p s lots of whiskey snobs here  love it i think there are a few odd misleading comments on here from the whiskey snobs but honestly there is nothing wrong with this dram and it is definitely worth the money  hate the new bottle but it did its job sales are up i had an unopened pre redesign bottle from 2016 and did a blind tasting with the new bottle and yep they 39 re the same so one of my favorite everyday scotches is still a favorite i just keep it in a brown paper wrapper  well balanced solid all rounder gets a bad rap from established online reviewers mainly because of the viking theme classic beautiful dram when you appreciate it for what it is sure it s easy drinking but it s not meant to be a 100 163 bottle  a pleasant whisky dark oranges with a hint of peat at the nose a mix of creamy fruity cake and spiciness at the palate a medium long finish spicy and quite bitter i would have preferred a final balvenie 12 like but this is a peated one i found pleasant to have a sip after lunch especially after some fruit oranges etc for a 12 year is quite complex perhaps some cannot like it anyway an interesting result  tastes like famous grouse  excited several years ago on discovering highland park while on a cruise in the caribbean and bought a liter labeled einar which was very much enjoyed on my next cruise i found a bottle labeled harald and discovered that there were six i believe in the series but they had been discontinued harald much like einar was very enjoyable and both received positive reviews from several friends all regular single malt drinkers i received a bottle of magnus for christmas of which i 39 ve only had a dram or two but anticipate sitting down with it in front of the fireplace this coming weekend visiting my eldest son this past weekend he opened a bottle of the viking honor 12 we both consider it as others have said a quot good evening dram quot and a quot great autumn dram quot smooth creamy and ideal for relaxing with your feet up in the recliner  not been a fan of highland park 39 s lower priced whisky but this is a revelation for the price it is superb  fell in love with design vikings lover highland park has its great whiskies for affordable price however this is not the case fall in love with design but not with flavour tastes like very low end whisky in beautiful bottle nothing special very short finish after sip you dont feel you 39 ve been drinking scotch watery light bodied texture with bit of fruits low smokiness almost none and all for 40 bucks in grocery shops coop switzerpand for that you rather get talisker or laphroaig perhaps even entry level of ardberg whiskies would be better disappointed mmm quite harsh for a 12 year old wouldn 39 t recommend not much better than a blended look elsewhere 3 5 and that 39 s generous wow so good  having persevered for half a bottle over a handful of sessions i can finally admit this is a keeper for guests that don t drink or are particularly well liked no depth no character there s some brine to it smoke afterthought is bang on almost non existent and an iodine bleachy ness to it don t fall for the marketing or the awards here tis utter crap  tastes like meths talisker rules used many years ago to be my favourite basic malt loved the dumpy bottle and sunrise label not a fan of the viking makeover of the packaging but that s by the by like others i really don t think this is as good as it used to be it s decent but no more and it s not as smokily complex as it was and that s a fact  delicious had the highland park 12 viking honour yesterday i have to say it 39 s one of the best in the 163 25 40 price bracket i 39 ve tried  beautiful bottle beautiful whisky as good as the spirit of the bear but half the price  very disappointing an incredibly short finish  mostly cinnamon oak and honey competing in the palate medium finish and the nose deceptively promises cherry oak and vanilla but thank god does not deliver those most reviewers here seem hung up on previous versions of hp reviewing the 12 yr old in my glass this is an incredibly consistent bottling i don 39 t get any real smoke or peat and the honey and spice are very well balanced if that s what you want game on judged on its own merits and not against some dimly remembered elixir it is not exactly worth the 70 cad in ontario but still quite lovely the drop off in intensity with the nas 39 magnus 39 expression was surprisingly intense curious what the 18 yr old or a cask strength offering would be like the viking lore and bottle design seem a bit ridiculous but i like the idea that i will get what i expect with the hp 12  light and sweet but also with a good punch of peppery flavour hint of smoke think the other reviews must have had a bad batch  this used to be a favourite of mine but when i spotted the redesign and started looking at the reviews became very apprehensive thought some of it was hyperbole and it couldn 39 t be that bad so picked up a bottle what a disappointment it really has turned into swill thin and watery with an awful paint stripper smell it was undrinkable believe the reviews and get yourself something else   of what it once was it now tastes like cheap young spirit heavy alcohol burn and without the subtlety or balance that once made this a great dram  this is a solid whiskey amp the third bottle i have bought of this in the last 4yrs there s some smoke on the pallet and a sweet honey finish a decent dram and very moreish i m surprised by all the negative comments  i don 39 t care for the bottle so i 39 m not giving it a bad rating from that i just can 39 t like how it tastes no matter how much i try tastes like vomit i guess it 39 s a straight upgrade from monkey shoulder which i also can 39 t like because it doesn 39 t taste young and unfinished sure but at same price point i 39 d pick eagle rare because it 39 s both higher proof and quasi single barrel with actual amazing flavours or just pick a laphroaig 10 you know because the smoke in this one just feels like an afterthought if a slightly smokey absolutely average scotch nothing bad about it but nothing remarkable either is exactly what you 39 re looking for this one is probably the one for you though i guess scotch just isn 39 t for me  for the price don t think twice  you know that putrid taste after you get a novacane shot in the mouth that 39 s what this tastes like the only reason to buy this is for a clearance isle cheap drink you hope not to remember don 39 t buy it save your money for something better i noticed a significant down grade in this entry level in 2016 it has dramatically gone down hill since then i want to like it as i have always adored hp but they need to give us a chance  all 40 abv whiskies are rubbish amazing how an extra 3 can make a big difference in flavour just too watery and lacking in flavours due to low abv puh why send stronger stuff to usa cause its the biggest market thats why  bought on a whim has a bit of bite to start with then mellows to my taste a nice finish im no expert but will buy again this used to be my go to 12 year single malt i thought my new bottle may be off but then i had some in a bar as others have noted it has changed and not for the better save your money it s a shadow of what it used to be and for this price point there are much better options my grandfathers favourite whisky used to be highland park and in his day they put out some good juice these days hp have screwed the pooch the edrington marketing machine have trashed one of the greatest reputations in single malt and let 39 s not even start on macallan looks good and now comes with a story alias like all those nas releases so if you believe in fairies  as a serious rum drinker would you buy a bottle with a stuffed parrot on its shoulder arrgh all this money spent on bottle and artwork designs likely by overpaid artists how about good old fashioned investment into the distillery you know stills casks warehouses etc  was given a bottle recently and to be totally honest was very underwhelmed there was nothing overtly offensive about the whisky its simply that it lacked any real character or interest there were some spicy notes to it some sweetness definitely some alcohol burn which i don 39 t often get with the whiskys i choose but overall just a lack of anything really special to set this apart i think there are many whiskys with the same age statements and completely lacking in age statements which are comfortably better than this a shame really as i 39 d heard big things about highland park wouldn 39 t buy again and after this experience unsure if i would purchase any other highland park stuff although there dark origins does look rather tempting worth noting the price is pretty cheap perhaps you do get what you pay for  i was brought back a tasting bottle of viking honour by a friend who had been on a scottish cruise the initial taste was good which led to greater flavours with a good depth that lingered on your palate i loved it can not understand all negative comments  i 39 m drinking as i 39 m writing it 39 s drinkable but doesn 39 t really wow very much it tastes far younger than the age statement but isn 39 t awful i would speculate the recipe is rowse squeezy honey mixed with orange peel and a few shots of laphroaig select aged in what smells like plywood and bottled there 39 s something gluey in the background as well it 39 s also somehow very thin more teenage girls from milton keynes with eating disorders than vikings fine for this price  i preferred the old 12 year with the simple marketing no need for anything about vikings on the label just concentrate on the whisky going in the wrong direction with this  not as good as it used to be  no way is this the same dram as the older bottlings tastes much more spirit driven lacks the complexity and roundness it had even just a few years ago it also has an initial acetone nose after pouring which it never had before and takes a long time to open up in the glass to be able to extract any kind of nose or taste i 39 m talking 15 20 minutes even after going through half a bottle long been a fan but most likely will not buy another bottle and i certainly will not pay insane prices for the new nas special editions  great dram for its category i cannot understand the negative reviews except for the possibility that there may be variance in the batches sweet honey mild smoke balanced prickle medium longish finish that evenly dissipates into pleasantness the intensity of the whole affair only reaches a moderate level but subtle complexity is present and it is always positive as an experience i 39 d like to see a high proof version of this 12 year old available that would be more intense rating is based on blends in this price range  such a monumental disappointment compared to what it used to be before the marketing took over avoid  hp 12 used to be so good such a singular statement peat but not in the smoky islay way in a truly unique differentiating orkney way the 12 used to be so good the 15 and 18 weren 39 t even necessary no need to further refine perfection the more recent expressions just do not capture that magick what a shame market with the magnus and the viking honour all you will fine just don 39 t bollocks up your core attractant your golden goose  fruity sweet honey a touch coastal not over complex but tasty could benefit from a higher abv say 46 no color added which is great not really into the viking thing so much but it s a cool bottle i guess good price point will buy again in the future but not something i have to have  i was given a bottle this past christmas it was a change from a islay malt i normally drink i have enjoyed every drop with cold highland water and occasionally with a good oatcake and a wee piece of 22 month mature cheddar  not a fan unfortunately have had lots of the old yellow and red stripe hp 12 and 18 the new 12 doesn 39 t taste very full to me seems very average and get too much smoke for me in comparison to other elements won 39 t be getting again or risking the 18  i would buy a bottle of 12 year old every year to 18 months in the knowledge that one could always rely on it to be lovely viking honour isn 39 t the same at all imo thin weak a bit harsh with that lovely highland park flavour lurking somewhere at the back and sadly a bit hard to get to these who drink it neat may not find a difference which i appreciate but i always drink with some still water to bring out the flavours and like some other contemporary expressions this kind of falls apart what a pity  the revamp is now looking very dated and as another review said what exactly was honourable about the viking s invasion of the island it all appears to have been smoke and mirrors getting really tired seeing the same black boxes on the supermarket shelves at the same time knowing the quality has been impaired and that the wider brand is being milked as much as it can be with high priced nas variants that really are pandering only to collectors and not people who actually drink it this 12 year old is on offer so often now in the supermarkets i can see why it s a shadow of its former self i wouldn t be surprised to see a complete rebranding very soon it needs it and it desperately needs a better quality product but it feels they are stretching everything too thinly laphroaig for me until things improve disappointing and not what it was a few years ago i have drunk highland park 12 year old for very many years many kind orcadians have given me 18 year old and older bottles over the years which have been hugely appreciated but i have always returned to the 12 year old as my favourite a few weeks ago when i reached 87 a kind neighbour gave me a bottle of 12 year old viking without a doubt this is the finest malt whisky that i have ever drunk well done the highland park team angus i was a big fan of the old hp12 and decided to get myself a bottle of the new viking honour all i can say is that it was a huge letdown the drink is nice on the nose but tastes both harsh and watery with none of the distinct flavors that i had come to enjoy the old hp12 was a lovely smooth drink with a wonderful lingering taste viking honour is more like moonshine i will not be buying highland park again any time soon  dreadfulreally strong smell of alcohol and then nothing derserves to be mentioned in the same breath as moonshine and rotgut  i wanted to love it i really wanted to i 39 ve always loved highland park the hp12 was a go to and the 18 was always a treat but this this was a terrible disappointment to a longtime devotee of the original highland park 12 expression which has in a grotesque act of unabashed villainy been replaced by this nasty characterless alcohol water no depth no character no more smoke just a lame sweet caramel combined with lackluster alcohol flavors i find myself wondering if they put a couple shots of caramel syrup in a bottle of everclear and diluted with water a travesty greater than which no distillery has heretofore had the gall to unveil and to think they re completely rebranding the distillery with these new flashy labels and bottles containing barely drinkable spirits ach ick yuck argh i find myself hoping i just got a bad bottle some of you seem to think the viking honour is still the same hp12 in a new bottle if only wishing made it so as for my bottle it might be better used as carburetor cleaner hyperbole aside while this expression is drinkable it 39 s totally lackluster i always considered the original hp12 my quot go to quot for non isaly malts i 39 m afraid however that i can 39 t recommend the viking honour 12 to anyone nor do i intend to buy it in the future  i like it don 39 t remember how much i paid for is as i recently expanded mt scotch collection so i can 39 t really say it was of value i have to tell you though i 39 ve read the tasting notes and comments i get neither a grilled orange or nsew tire rubber taste smell i smell and taste some sweetness with a hint of smoke sort of like i 39 m chewing orange rock candy in a cigar lounge  i simply cannot get beyond the odor of this whisky on the palette i discern the potential for a complex dram here slightly sweet smoky and without the alcohol so often associated with a young whisky the nose however is very similar to new automotive tire rubber sulphur with a hint of smoke beyond this 39 new tire smell 39 sticks with me and obscures any other more redeeming qualities i will not be finishing this 50 bottle what a shame  on first taste after opening the bottle the overwhelming flavour was smokey but after the third occasion the smokey taste had almost disappeared disappointingly so and the flavour took on a more subtle nature with honey to the fore would i purchase this whiskey again i certainly would one of the best single malts i have tried  lovely as smooth as a 12 year old malt can be this delicious malt will surprise for its subtle warmth and sweet flavors and will be snapped up at this price  i have enjoyed the occasional bottle of hp12 over the last 40 years recently i bought a bottle and was very disappointed i put it down to my ageing taste buds but it seems that others believe its not the dram it used to be  not much going on the nas ardmore legacy has more complexity in terms of going for a sweet smoky relationmild drinkable but not impressed this really has no legs and no body a sad decline drinkable but very humdrum save your money and buy one of aldi or lidl 39 s 39 highland 39 offerings instead as the flavour profile is very similar i 39 ve been lucky enough to try older versions of hp and believe me this had declined significantly  holy fuck its good my 39 problem 39 is that i remember the old hp12 the heather honey subtle smoke and sherry it was my father 39 s favourite and one of mine one i always had in my store this more recent version though just does not do it for me take off the hp12 label put it in another bottle and it 39 s drinkable enough but pretty unmemorable i don 39 t know what the distillers up there in orkney are thinking about perhaps they 39 re too busy churning out the plethora of nas versions with ridiculous names in fancy packaging to concentrate on reviving their previously excellent core 12 year old i will not be buying again even at the reduces price my taste buds deserve better  i haven 39 t tried the 39 original 39 it 39 s worth mentioning that horst luening from whisky com says this and the old version are exactly the same apart from the name and bottling he also rates it very highly if it 39 s good enough for horst it 39 s good enough for me anyway this is an absolutely delicious whisky the only problem is that it is far too easy to drink the taste is interesting but very accessible it 39 s the very definition of a good session whisky i wish i had the 43 version where i am it is bottled at 40 if it were a little thicker bodied and had a bit more kick it would be perfect as it stands it 39 s still a very good whisky  couldn 39 t believe all those reviews i had to buy it and taste it myself old one was much better all flavors are pulled down compared to the old one and where is peat smoke won 39 t buy this one anymore sorry highland park h p 12 from 2015 before the viking malarky spread through h p 39 s marketing strategy i picked up today november 2018 from my local co op for 163 28 nothing like the current viking dishonour being pedalled under the guise of whisky why 39 viking 39 in anyway they cleared off a good 800 years before the h gt p distillery was founded the old style h p in my glass has real oak on the nose is softer yet also has more character the peat smoke seems more integrated quite frankly its bloody good for the price if you see a bottle get it  i can honestly say that this is the worst single malt i 39 ve ever tasted absolute pish hp should be ashamed it 39 s watery no debth not finish at all it tastes like orange peel that 39 s it  being the philistine i am i quite enjoy hp 12 viking honor after reading the furor over the change in 2017 i bought an old bottle to do a side by side taste test and well i prefer the new stuff more honey less oddly oaky and something that keeps drawing me back perhaps i have simple tastes but i simply enjoy this dram  one of the worst malts i 39 ve had over the last years this was a huge let down if you liked the old hp12 you will hate this one i think it 39 s the worst possible option for the money and you 39 re better off buying a glenmoranjie or even a simple glen grant 10 the nose is nice palate is average and lacks complexity and the aftertaste well i decided to have a snickers bar afterwards to get rid of it it 39 s like dog pissed wood that is burnt together with old car tyres  first time in a while for hp for me but what i remember about it was smooth and that still applies came on offer too so an added advantage  a few of my customers recommended this one and i was surprised to see so many bad reviews after my first dram for a 50 12 yr chill filtered single malt this is good and very drinkable a bit sweet and a bit spicy not a whole lot of finish but complex enough for what it is goes down easy  many reviews here say the new 12 year old is not a patch on the old 12year old my taste buds must be shot because in a blind tasting comparison i couldn 39 t tell the difference between the two shop around and you will get it for 163 25 which is excellent value for what it is i do agree they are overselling the viking quot link quot and the bottle is very pretty but i don 39 t buy a whisky for its packaging  never tried the original hp but been drinking various whiskies over the last few months and highland park viking honour left me wanting got a nice peppery honey and wood nose but that s the best part taste is mediocre and the finish well i don t think their is one kinda just disappears no honey aftertaste or cream just nothing i like complex drama that change at various stages of tasting but this is as shallow as a puddle  i had never tried any highland park before i bought this version yesterday my foray into single malts started with a gift of laphroig 10 from my son a few years ago and i acquired the taste after a few shots however this year i have taken to exploring other brands and i really love talisker skye reading great reviews about highland park 12 recently aroused my interest so when i learnt that sainsbury 39 s were offering it for just 25 pounds i went and got one not realising that it was this viking stuff in short i found it bland and a let down come to think of it though the vikings were a bunch of pirates and plunderers so what is viking honour really worth not a lot  i used to love the old highland park 12 year old it was amongst my all time favourite whiskies however this expression is just nowhere nearly as good come on h p get it sorted before you ruin the once great reputation you once had  the taste of cheapness to put it simply this whiskey applies an approach of incremental economies in order to produce a harsh moonshine esque malt fast distillation to push the spirit out quicker then placed into planter quality barrels with a hope and a prayer that any flavour would be imbued utter dissatisfaction in a glass  this is not 12 y o highland park not even a literally paler imitation the nose is pleasant enough if a little simplistic but i recommend you stop there before the firewater taste hits your throat rough fiery and shallow no complexity of taste at all bring back maturing in sherry casks and cut the stupid hype viking honour viking horror more like  as an old admirer of highland park i bought this 12 yo viking honour recently i have enjoyed some very good highland parks since the late 1990 s especially the 18 yo now i m wondering if highland park is trying to destroy their reputation completely the latest 18 yo i bought was nothing near older bottlings in quality and this viking honour is so bad i will not drink it up what are they doing up there at the distillery maybe they attract new customer knowing nothing about whisky with this viking stuff but as a norwegian i think my ancestors the vikings would turn around in their graves if such a bad whisky had their name on the bottle the smell had a touch of smoke a touch of honey but in the mouth the taste and aftertaste it was horrific raw spirit taste and not the best spirit either the casks used must be of the lowest order used way to many times it is cheap but it is a reason for that goodbye to highland park from me i say this with sadness but you can t let quality suffer like this and sell such a bad whisky to paying customers i ve read that it is the same old 12 yo well if you belive in santa claus maybe the old 12 yo was a good 3 star whisky in my book this is undrinkable for enjoyment and deserves a zero  tis a saft drink this one grand nose though much less bright and subtle than the 39 tasting 39 39 notes 39 suggest more burnt than grilled orange green tea and jasmine very much absent white pepper and wood to the fore more aftertaste than taste orange fanta is much more satisfying and thirst quenching and just as easy to down a pint of save up 163 20 more and buy an ardbeg 10 and drinnk a maaaannnns drink arrrrr  just cracked open my bottle tonight and i find it very balanced and quite delicious don t know why so many bad reviews for the price you cannot go wrong i just tried this new viking edition side by side with the old non viking edition and i 39 m very sad to say the difference is like night and day this is the same flavor true but the old version has less caramel sweetness but much more smoke still not a bad whisky good for first timers and people who may get turned off by strong flavors but the viking version is just boring  great value and i personally love the new bottle design however the contents are not as good as they were before this 39 viking honour 39 marketing ploy i agree with comments of a rather rushed distillation and maturation in some pretty clapped out casks  balance is the word sweetness smoke and bitter this dram has everything  did nothing for me felt bland and uneventful this definitely didn t live up to the hype it gets  just tanned the last dram of this i am now sad hp 12 vh is one of my favs hint of smoke on the nose gives way to a lovely bittersweet taste that to me is distinctive and outstanding for a 163 30 bottle of malt you ll struggle to find better bottle this is one of my favourite whiskies very smooth hints of lavender citrus wood and honey haven t found another in a similar price range as good as this one perfect with a wee drop of water to open up the flavours only negative far too easy to drink  did not like stick with the regular 12 year offering if you can find it   i 39 m just done skipping loved the hp12 and grabbed a couple of extra bottles while i could despite the somewhat ugly bourbon style bottle but at least it looked rustic that didn 39 t bother me and the carton tube was great packaging and marketing that abuses my intelligence well i 39 d actually be embarrassed to own a bottle like that it screams quot i 39 m an ignoramus i buy packaging and hype not content quot remember when the rugged vikings sipped single malt in their victory halls no neither does anybody cuz it never happened they looted scotland centuries before distillation began so why bother with this tripe  nope this is far from the quality hp 12 used to be very short finish which suggests distilling as fast as possible then emptied into knackered casks with nothing to add to the spirit and this is why they can sell it cheaper than any other 12 y o malt don 39 t believe me try scapa glansa instead same island similar age much better oh and i guess they can claim viking heritage as well stop complaining indeed just buy something else  some people online are crazy about how the new bottling is completely different and worse is it different perhaps but slightly do i believe these people can identify it in a blind test absolutely not onto the whisky nose is floral with smoky background the palate does not let down peaty smoke that reveals orange honey and subtle spice good length finish that is peaty i 39 d highly recommend it one last rant about marketing if marketing disgusts you so much that it changes the taste of the whisky in your mouth then go hire a good marketer and let them change it back  nice balanced pricing very good don t listen to the haters at that price its a solid 4 stars  as far as i can tell this is pretty much the same pretty good stuff as before the marketing is complete bs however what nonsense sad in fact viking wtf dimnishes the brand silly imho  marketing style over substance i liked hp before the recent rebranding and underneath it all it s still a decent enough whisky but it s compromised as a result and in my view the insane marketing of the broader range including multiple hp variants and the endless variations on the viking theme is starting to look embarrassing i know that hp has a very strong fan base but it s starting to feel less like a mature traditional whisky with real heritage and respect all of which it used to have in spades and more like an exercise in clever marketing aimed only at collectors that s sad and it s damaging the reputation of a very fine whisky  on the nose butter like orchard fruits possibly rich dark chocolate on the pallet smokey honey and fresh fruit finish is sweet slightly smokey and not overly long a very nice anytime dram in my opinion  dissapointing somewhat weak and diluted nicely honey fruity and approachable but but but i thought vikings were men this is definitely a 39 quot metro quot version and more appropriately called quot snowflake 39 s honour quot i 39 m sorry but even jw black walks all over this with bare feet i want my 39 back  all that hype of quot entry level quot single malt it 39 s alright but nothing memorable yes it has a proper highland character of spicy finish but i dont understand why is so popular on many whiskey forums i genuinely have more joy from drinking blends like jw black than from this single malt buy old pultney 12 instead at least you 39 re going to get something with own character i tasted it few times and i am not going to buy a whole bottle i would give it 3 stars but because of all the hype around it i take 0 5 star home with me  really nice well balanced well worth the cost not the old hp12 at all side by side this one is weak and bland i 39 ll be looking out for old stock of the good stuff before it gets collectable  great whisky compared to its predecessor a true let down lacks both smoothness and richness of the older 12 i dare say i would rather buy the new 10 than this not much difference to be honest this one is definitely not worth its price  i was very disappointed to see the well loved hp 12 converted into 39 viking honour 39 an entirely bogus name which i suppose was cynically chosen by the marketing men to appeal to less sophisticated buyers a heavy pretentious bottle covered in gaelic swirls i was also disappointed with the whisky to drink it is not the same and has lost the smoothness of the real thing unlike all previous hp 39 s i wasn 39 t sorry to finish it  even though i drink single malt scotch more than any other liquor i am no expert so no comments from me on nose etc but i know what i like and this one i like not too peaty and a very reasonable price  as a newbie to scotch with only having 6 other bottles of moderately priced whisky under my belt i have to say that this is a close 2nd for me behind my favourite johnnie walker black i enjoy the long finish with the peppery spice on the nose i don 39 t find it overwhelming and am able to pick out a few characteristics yet still have trouble picking out individual flavours but i put that down to inexperience in tasting would definitely recommend any fellow newbies to give it a shot especially as i would say it 39 s a gentle introduction to peated whiskys especially if you can find it on special offer  honestly this is not the original highland park 12 what i bought is on a par with a cheap blend and is harsh for what i paid for it second the benromach ten much better for the same price even ballantines is better i bought mine a couple of years ago before the quot viking quot rebranding mine is the one that ralfy said is a quot bourbon bottle quot design it was on sale for a few bucks less i love it and savoring the now half bottle for special occasions i would give 4 5 stars and would give 5 if it was 46 without chill filtration and colorant ok so i didn 39 t like the old bottle but liked the malt now i 39 m hesitant to try the new hp12 despite the nicer bottle what i really don 39 t understand is the whole viking motiff didn 39 t vikings ravage the scottish shores looting the goods raping and pillaging shouldn 39 t scotch be about scotland instead of paying a viking designer maybe invest in casks i might try the new bottle if i see it reduced but i hope i don 39 t get disappointed say it ain 39 t so  search for an online review none except those bought and paid for by h p ask yourself why none of the usual bloggers vloggers reviewers will tough it  there s no manuka honey in it  really fresh creamy floral sweetness citrus honey fresh lawn maybe perhaps scorched fresh orange oil like when garnishing a cosmopolitan agave syrup maybe light smokiness with a lovely pepper and spice finish very nice island malt opens up lovely with a few drops of water  after the first few glasses i gave up on this bottle its rubbish as a single malt ended up using the rest in my home made blend as a filler with some decent peated islay caol isla for smokey top notes and older tomintoul to add depth and richness seriously h p how low can you get this in my opinion its barely worth using in a blend go knows how many times the casks had been re used  i think your tasting notes are spot on it has a wonderful nose and an interesting palate the finish is truly long and peppery without any overwhelming harshness  new to the world of scotch so far i 39 ve tried a bottle of chivas regal 12 year chivas regal 18 year and some glenlivet 12 year i didn 39 t think much of scotch until i tried to drink bourbon for the first time and found it absolutely disgusting now i just purchased this bottle of hp 12 year viking honor and it 39 s really freaking good sniffing the cork i could smell the honey and sipping on my first glass i 39 m loving every sip i 39 m not a seasoned scotch drinker but so far any scotch is better than a cheap corn infused bourbon i poured a glass on the rocks and it 39 s smooth mellow sweet but not too sweet and smells wonderful would buy again there may be better scotch 39 s out there but i haven 39 t gotten a chance to try them yet this is my first tasting of highland park scotch whiskey and i love it  there are two stables of my cupboard for whiskys that i just want to drink day after day and this is one of them along with the balvenie carribean cask an absolute awesome dram for the 163  bought this as i had always wanted to try the original hp not knowing that it had changed i never got around to trying the original hp so i cannot truly compare this to it but here goes the viking theme is a bit fake and naff although the bottle design is kinda cool in its own right this is not a terrible dram but for me it did not live up to the high expectations i had formed based on the reputation of the original first impression is good a mild burst of almost islay like smoke but then instead of the long mellow highland finish i might have expected there is a sharp burst of rye like peppery quality with rather long bitter citrus finish now i love smokey islays and i love peppery ryes but the 2 profiles do not sit comfortably together for me in combination clearly this is not swill but it does not feel as satisfying and well integrated as i had hoped it does not seem to know what it wants to be neither fish nor fowl the original highland park 12 is my favourite single malt by a long way this one lacks depth and complexity i hope we don 39 t have to wait too many years for a decent highland park again  i have been drinking hp 12 for nearly 15 years this is not only a horrible marketing re brand but don 39 t believe if when they say the formulation is the same it isn 39 t it 39 s weaker it flat out sucks switching to oban  my first contact with a single malt scotch whisky and it completely changed my world it 39 s so nice the peat is smooth but awesome  not what it used to be just plain dull very smooth and tasty really good for a 12 yr  yes there is hype but underlying this is the fact that this is a finely balanced dram that ticks most boxes  all style and no substance firstly i half expected a tiny viking to jump out of the box swinging a small axe that might have been preferable this is so dull hps standard offering has been on the decline for years and this is another rung down the ladder drinkable but drab   possible to give zero stars so half star it is an over packaged sulphured disappointment don 39 t believe the marketing hype  horrible new redesign and packaging and a whisky that tastes of sulphur don 39 t believe the hype marketing  used to be excellent isn 39 t any more  i agree with craig ferguson hp is the very finest spirit in the world  i take after my old man he liked s good single malt this one 39 s for you dad xxxx experience a very easy drinkable single malt brought by a friend now a real good friend loved it you gotta love the quot anti hype quot people have i 39 ve had it and it is the exact same stuff believe me hp ambassodor also assured me it is just new bottle to tie it together with the others and why not vikings where from there and lets face it branding matters enough of that it is a properly good whisky but light and delicate in comparison to the older stuff i know huge surprise right i was recently in a tasting and everybody liked the 12 valkyrie is much more a divider some like some don 39 t quot cause it doesn 39 t taste like hp quot so you want all of them to taste the same some whisky snobs  i don 39 t know if i got a bad bottle but to me this is pretty tasteless not at all that excellent the previous 12 yo that were one of my favorite  hate hate hate the branding marketing and packaging  lovely smooth smoky whisky a must in my whisky cabinet  very smooth i liked it rekomended poor especially compared to the usual hp gives me grouse vibes nasty lingering after taste often found with cheap blends  don 39 t be fooled by the fancy bottle its proper rubbish compared to the original its a nicely decorated bottle and nothing more why did they do this  ive liked highland park for a few too many years it 39 s very easy to drink and with good flavours and nose to it for the record i detect no sweaty socks i will in future be smelling my socks carefully incase i 39 m wrong sweet with a delicate smokey after taste which all in all is very agreeable would recommend this whisky  amazing taste goes down to easy  fresh and light on the nose i get the creamy undertones i find it rather light and uninspiring on the palate but a very nice spicy finish  lovely dram really nice clean dram for the price super value  the highland park 12 year old viking honour is very smooth and slightly peaty it holds 1st place in my 39 tour of scotland cabinet 39  this is a very nice malt one of the best i have had in a long time actually it goes down to easily and one is never enough the bottle shape and design are brilliant might have to re use it also price is just fantastic for a 12 year old screams of marketing overload for the duty free shelves quite frankly irrelevant 39 viking 39 bollox which i find tacky and somehow cartoon like add to that the caramel orange glow pennypinching 40 strength and chill filtering yes folks this is a full on commercial product trading on previous reputations shame because the previous packaging was quite classy 163 32 in morrisons in the glass its a differant story nose is like an aged grain whisky not a bad thing with tropical fruits amp some heather certainly no smoke taste is sharper amp typically h p dry yet quite rounded there 39 s a 39 tang 39 to it but it 39 s not peat finish is short except the tang turns into a youthful nip strangely in an empty glass the residual nose is really good in conclusion absolutely zero smoke or peat its quite drinkable as an alternative to chival regal 12 or similar but no way does this do credit to highland park as a single malt this goes to the back of the cupboard for flaming steaks in a viking style of course  lacking in complexity a bit but for the price it 39 s a steal and there is hardly anything more complex for this kind of money anyway sweet smooth and totally enjoyable also brilliant new design  horrible as soon as i took out the cork it smelled of sweaty socks i have never tasted quot sweaty socks quot but the taste was what i imagined they would taste not an improvement and a big disappointment i wont be buying this again back to laphroig  this is a crazy good whisky for 163 25 i normally choose an islay malt but this is such a drinkable approachable and in the best possible way relatively undemanding drink for me the strength lies in the smoky finish and i love it gotta say i also love the re branding  received a bottle for my birthday thoroughly enjoyed and enjoying it  what a bargain a great whisky at a great price a viking triumph 
1955.0, a new discovery and one i will definitely return to smooth and easy to drink with a great finish fantastic value  deanston was the first scotch i ever tried and after going on a journey of discovery tasting various different whiskies from all the regions it remains my number 1 deliciously malty resinous barley sugar and fresh wood with a finish that lingers long after your last sip overall an amazing dram and i would highly recommend to anyone whether you are experienced or not  one of the best value integrity malts on the market at the moment and one of the most pleasurable flavour profiles deanston has some of the characteristics of loch lomond linkwood fettercairn etc sweet malts but the honeyed nutty quality of the 12 in particular stands out for how relatively unacerbic the spirit element is and despite its sweetness isn 39 t as saccharine as a loch lomond the 12 is mature and balanced and the complimentary flavours do give it a rather 39 easy drinking 39 profile which some may find disappointing if looking for a challenge but there is complexity there too not quite the full bodied punch of an arran for example but dumpsters your average glenfiddich 12 in its delicate charms do try the worthy 18yo as well if you find it cheap it often is much like linkwood and fettercairn the combination of sweetness with bitter oak from higher vintages is compelling long may this distillery remain affordable and quot undiscovered quot  very ordinary and uninteresting as authentic as it comes oak galore here perhaps too much as it lingers slightly in the mouth but a pretty solid offering and good value  great price for a good whiskey it is also good with chocolate dale scotch crikey  i love the original deanston and hated the virgin oak issue glad to see the original returning  delicious definite orange on the nose with a lovely sweetness when first supped this is a lovely 12 year old wish i had bought more  very impressed with this apart from being unchillfiltered and without colouring aspects i really apreciate because a more natural product is a classic single malt ex bourbon cask malty with a spicy burst that spread all the mouth well done deanston i love it simple classic without the trend of finishing whisky in something else  starts honey sweet moves into a walnut character finishes with hints of smoke easy to drink clean  i 39 m surprised by the number of positive reviews i found this extremely ordinary nothing particularly unpleasant but most blends have more to them than this  a solid scotch for the price well rounded and smooth with a nice nose  one of the great 12 yr olds fabulous bargain this has pretty much everything bar sherry struth incredible whisky my guess is its aged in well fired casks which gives so much vanilla honey and sweetness on the palate absolute delight for the price  not being the type that takes my scotch neat i make myself a rob roy three shots of deanston a generous shaking of bitters and two shots of sweet vermouth drink this over the course of an hour or so left with a very nice mellow afterglow  nose beautifully balanced timber orange palate scented cloves but in a divinely balanced performance wonderous 160 after the after is medium in length and in its lacks particular characteristics but that said the palate is so sublime you dance to that tune  amazing value very complex and interesting for a 12 yo un chillfiltered 46 3 abv and natural colour thumbs up there are some bitter notes on the notes that i am not quite able to put my finger on i have had a bottle of the 15 yo organic and actually prefer this 12 yo as i find it much more accessible the 15 yo took a lot more effort and never got as enjoyable as this one imo  its tastes amazing its over 46 its non chilfilterd and its free of caramel colour plus its cheaper than many crap blends a must buy  honey vanilla cereal toffee water and time balance things very nicely a delicious dram easy going but interesting  my first impression on the nose was blackcurrant jeez i sound like a spoff i got a bit of laphroaig ian phenol too the taste is a curiously sweet one maybe tablet  i spent 2 3 hours reading and watching reviews of this one bought it recently and was disappointed i was looking forward to this one because it 39 s said to be one of the best 12 yr out there it is ralfy 39 s whisky of the year 2020 and he gave it 89 points in his review but well my bottle wasn 39 t near any heat source in the store but the batch could have been flawed though it 39 s not likely though i didn 39 t find the whisky to be smooth rich or even sweet i wanted to give this 4 5 stars as i expected but something went wrong it wasn 39 t like quot bad bad quot but it wasn 39 t either like all the reviewers said or maybe it was just too harsh for me  this new incarnation of deanston 12 is lovely kudos to deanston for upping the abv and dropping filtration this is a nice old school full and satisfying whiskey it 39 s pretty obvious why ralfy made this his whiskey of the year it 39 s a very fine dram at an affordable price  nastiest stuff i ever sipped forced down half a bottle poured the rest down the sewer  nose fresh and light with citruspalate smooth and seaside feel finish nigh on perfect end for me warm controlled and more orange and lemon beautiful light taste with lots of fruit and sweetness a lovely oily texture which masks the actual alcohol proof of the malt and as a result makes it far too easy to indulge a superb malt whisky after all this time and past experiences of lovely malts this is my favourite  i only drink taliskar and deanston 12 yo it s fresh light subtle and the antidote to peaty seaweedy heaven it 39 s been over a decade since i have had this and wow it is so much better malty nutty and zesty with a nice balance of sweetness and a long finish for a 12 year old i really can see why people are starting to talk about this distillery  fields of barley on a hot sunny day with a hint of farmer 39 s dust to the nose freshly cut bitter oak with some sweet vanilla to the palate the finish starts off slow and soft and then hits me with a quick but enjoyable tingling zing very nice fruity sweet and mildly spicy 12 year old good quality for the very reasonable price quite complex i prefer not to add water but that 39 s personal taste  i can get this for 50 bucks tax and all may be the best all around 12 year old i have tried  isn 39 t it odd the amount of comments saying that they don 39 t know what type cask this is and one even saying he thinks it 39 s matured in ex sherry in fact this is an absolute classic ex bourbon cask matured single malt anyone who has ever experienced kentucky bourbon matured in charred american white oak barrels would not fail to recognise the previous contents of the cask type which this scotch was matured in being that it is natural colour and a light golden straw hue is another dead give away  one of the best 12 y o core expressions out there this new version with the white label is apparently much better than the old brown one  excellent multi layered flavour our go to at all levels the 5 star rating is purely for the juice itself not in context of price value nor transparency would be nice to know the casks used just a comment so say that ralfy of ralfystuff on youtube the only reviews you 39 ll ever need ralfy is spot on as always in his review he mentions not adding too much water to this deanston a few days ago i poured a dram and added the typical amount of water i add to 46 malts perhaps 3 tea spoons it was too much last night i added about a teaspoon and the experience was totally different better add a drop at a time to see how much is right for you but with the right amount this is a lovely dessert malt with substance and body  i 39 m enjoying this it 39 s frustrating that their website talks about honesty yet fails to even tell you the casks used for maturing this 12 core expression but i enjoy them all i am no expert or snob or connoisseur but this one tastes to me like a sherry monster reminds me of aberlour 12 48 un chill filtered macallan gold glenmo lasanta it may not be exactly like those but it covers that side of the palette it also tastes good on the palate being un chill filtered and above 46 and presumably natural color it 39 s an honest offering  looking for something a bit less expensive i had bought a case of this one recently for the store and took one home tonight this certainly does not hold up to the last few bottles i had which were admittedly more expensive springbank 15 springbank 10 and macallan 12 sherry cask it was reminiscent of the macallan 12 on the entry a sweet highland single malt but a bit hot on the finish due to the proof flavors were typical highland caramel toffee with a touch of smoke all fine and good but the aftertaste and finish left a taste of cardboard in my mouth for quite a long time and i have to say it was disappointing i might use this for godfathers or something would not really recommend it although the lingering cardboard finish is the only negative i have it is a big one  smooth up front not harsh on the finnish a pleasant surprise given the price  50ml poured into a scotch glass nose prominent orange and zest with underlying cereal tones first taste salinity a bit nutty and saline tasting caramel flavor but not overly sweet i think the saline flavor off sets it the finish is quot soft quot with no burn does not linger 2nd taste more of the same but a little sweeter overall i like this not overly complicated and not smokey at all this is simply easy to sip on i prefer this over glen 12 doesn 39 t drink like a high abv scotch no burn on the nose or palate  have been drinking scotch whiskey for 35 years bought this one on a hunch didn 39 t want to spring for a bottle of oban and thought this deanston was fabulous and right up there with my favorite oban  i splurged on a bottle of this and now seriously regret it based on my experience i do not recommend this if you enjoy sipping whisky neat as i do i don 39 t know if i got a bad batch but it didn 39 t sit well at all and made me feel ill after i 39 d only had a shot 39 s worth and i 39 d call myself an experienced whisky drinker not sure whether to let friends try it after the experience i 39 d say the 46 is too noticeable and doesn 39 t go down smoothly flavour profile is on the spicy side not particularly delicious but not bad  absolutely gorgeous  a very good whisky and i don 39 t like whiskies but this one was good  first time ever i tasted deanston i was glad to see the scottish mist in the dram after adding a bit of water theunchill filtration is a wonderful thing certainly for the eye in the nose the barley and the fruity marmelade thefirst zip without water had a bit of a alcohol nip but went creamy adding a little water fresh brewed tea and the smell of a morning piece of toast a nutty finish completed the tasting finish is not very long or complex but a good dram for a decent price  excellent for the price orange peel raisins and caramel on the nose velvet on the palate with oak and a vanilla sweetness  a lovely smooth dram well worth the investment  took my husband on the tour in september for part has his birthday loved it i got him a bottle to take home to england didn 39 t last long was very nice will be ordering some more for the cupboard relatively new to the single malt scene i 39 ve come to love this sadly currently unavailable or so it seems in quebec and ontario i have been able however to acquire it from colleagues and relatives traveling in the us where it can be obtained for as little as 55usd 70cad at present exchange which i consider to be an absolute bargain  i live in a small town in ontario and although the liquor store expanded they have stocked the shelves with more facing of the same product the always had except for a few very expensive blends under lock and key i found myself in a store near toronto and was quite happy shopping for near an hour the reviews on this site game me want to try the deanston 12 i am not disappointed the flavour is easy to enjoy once past the sharp alcohol in the first sip this whiskey will be a staple on my shelf and it is way under priced for the complexity on the tongue and the abrupt finish it makes me want another one and is that a bad thing cheers came to scotland and the first sample of whisky i 180 ve got was the deanston 12 year old i 180 m not a whisky nerd but i must say that this one works out perfect a nice whisky for a nice price  total perfection for a 12 year malt sad to say bottle empty  shenanigans i don 39 t see that anyone has left a maliciously bad review for deanston 12 on this thread although everyone is entitled to their opinions both good and bad so let 39 s stick to the dram shall we from a neat pour the nose initially has a lot of alcohol the 46 3 isn 39 t hidden well but soon settles down not much on the nose it 39 s fairly hot and confused at first then blood orange zest and lots of barley come thru the palate is velvety with gorgeous oak flavor and lots of salt that transitions into a dry honey flavored finish not bad but not high marks either this un chill filtered deanston has some nice qualities including a coastal like salinity which is intriguing for a midlands distillery but it unfortunately lacks greatly in depth or layers of flavor and length of finish if you 39 re into light orange and oak and don 39 t mind a touch of smoke you 39 ll get a much better whisky from a clynelish 14 at the same price point  a bargain for the price on the nose there is malt nuts salt a touch of peat and smoke very smoky and nutty on the palate with a very decent finish needs time on the glass  pretty good scotch at a decent price light heather honey beautiful salty citrus tequila like finish would buy again don t forget it s 46 3 non chill filtered extra on that  the best to my taste of the light caramel vanilla lemmon peelno need to add watertastes like heaven this is what i call craft whisky lovely stuff rj  i ve never been a scotch drinker but this has won me over excellent  this is my goto recommendation at my bar to people looking for a lighter dram but also has complexity some of them are experienced scotch drinkers some are looking to replace their glenlivets without fail it s always a hit simply put this is a world class whisky that most people can really enjoy i ll try and be fair about this if you review a craft whisky and give it a one star you need to refrain from reviewing and get out there and educate yourself you re simply not there yet  jon bought me a bottle of this and we sipped through it quite quickly very smooth with bags of raisins on the nose and vanilla lasting sadly not much of it left fred thought is very nice smooth with pleasant taste would buy again  my title says it all as others have said the tone of the negative reviews here renders them highly suspect  i m buying some right now being in the u s and not in a major metropolitan area it is hard to acquire much beyond the quot usual suspects quot i was intrigued when i saw this in a store near rochester ny and have thoroughly enjoyed it  three bad reviews in a row and one from a guy who had not drunk it yet makes me wonder  i forgot to rate the economical price helped earn the extra half star  i recently tried the deanston 12 yr and wanted to see what others thought of it hence my visit to this site i too am confused by the overly negative reviews and agree with one poster s comments that they may have has ulterior motives for the bashing in my opinion this is a very nice scotch when you are in the mood for something lighter and sweeter and not in the mood for smoky or peaty offerings let me just state for the record that when i am in the mood for the later type several versions of laphroaig fit the bill perfectly it s certainly a matter of personal taste though i feel almost sorry for those who can only enjoy one narrow taste profile when the world of scotch offers so many to enjoy i am also slightly curious as to how those negative reviewers feel about macallans i was able to sample this at the weekend and found it light and sweet i am no stranger to a variety of different malts and blends so am highly confused by the inconsistency of reviews on this page i call on someone with the ability to investigate this inconsistency as it seems a shame for a lovely whisky to be tarnished by these bizarre claims  i see people giving this a good review and i think i must be drinking something else this stuff is foul both painful to the nose and pallet it s how i d imagine distilled marmite to taste like don t get me wrong whisky is by far and away my favorite spirit but this stuff is nasty by all means try it and see for your self but this one certainly isn t for me in fact most people trying it in the pub were under the same impression  i call shenanigans on all the bad reviews for both deanston and tobermory 10 i am a restauranteur bar owner and have stocked both over the course of many years after doing multiple blind tastings i am a fan of well balanced subtle complex slightly sweet non bitter and easy drinking smooth liquors i am not a fan of harsh alcohol tasting burn overly strong flavors heavily intense flavors i can understand why those who prefer a stronger bolder profile might not enjoy tobermory or deanston as much a i do but in no way can i understand some of the quot worst i ve ever had quot type criticisms from anyone unless they are drinking from a damaged abused or counterfeit bottle or the bad reviews might be from those with other motives i urge all to try for themselves taste blind if possible among a selection of good offerings and make up one s own mind deanston 12 and tobermory 10 are among my favorite scotch whiskies at any price and are truly great values with price considered ledaig also gets a nod from me as well  sweet and easy to drink most excellent for the price  just cannot understand the criticism this is a great malt with a distinctive biscuit flavour and some interesting spices it s also fantastic value and bottled at 46 highly recommended in its sharp lemon honey flavour the deanston 12 is really quite delightful almost refreshing the unpleasant alcohol burn and the over arching harshness of it make it much harder going than its flavour can carry sadly even with the addition of water  the worst single malt i ve tried so far 35 different distillers and worse than many blends badly made spirit aggresive and bitter awful  found it at joe canal s in princeton nj haven t tried it yet but the bottle is pretty i enjoy a range of quality malts but this isn t one of them been given e bottle of deanston 12 year old and it has to be the most awful whiskey i have tried to drink in 50 years  hard to find but a very decent malt for this cost complicated and very nice drinker  having explored a reasonable gamut of malts i find myself returning to this deanston 12yr over and over again i think i have now finished 6 bottles of this whisky and have just today bought another while this is not a particularly special single malt what it does have going for it is that spark of taste that keeps you coming back consistency is a large key here and each sip just feels like an old friend you ve known for years and will happily know for life it is very easy to drink and quite smooth both with and without a splash of water the tasting notes above are pretty accurate to my taste buds  just great and yes underrated  nothing to see here move along  the definition of a light refreshing whisky perfectly balanced mouth wateringly zesty not acidic sweet without becoming cloying and dangerously easy to drink wins you over with its subtle charms i keep coming back to this one  we live in the philadelphia area usa and can t find this anywhere it was truly the best overall single malt scotch light caramel and hint of honey the 12yr is the best
5989.0, absolutely delectable i love this slighlty unpopular gem found it at bevmo for 75 bucks wasnt sure so i checked on here and boy was i happy after the first sip tastes almsot like a light dessert liqueur pick this up asap hopefully you find it for less than 75 but i am still very happy with this selection  one of the truly great 12 year old drams beautifully smooth with pears and apricot coming through excellent value would highly recommend  i like a sherry cask whisky and you can end up having to spend a lot for a decent one this has everything for me spicy a good burn at the back of the throat and then the sweet richness of the sherry and bourbon casks plus it s a decent abv complex rich and delicious am no expert but of course i know what i like this is now my first equal favourite along with balvenie doublewood for a single malt under 163 50 not that i often try many over 163 50 of course one needs some different tastes in the cupboard to complement and suit different moods eg something peated and something light yet subtle like old pulteney as this is a pretty rich taste  stunning dram i get a lovely slightly sweet malty barley sugar flavour full bodied smooth as silk and burstng with flavour a great after dinner malt really bemefits from being bottled at 48 with no colouring or chill filtering  this is a truly phenomenal whisky that is underappreciated a truly great bang for your buck and more complex and unique than most whiskies on the market nose apples spices almost a warm apple pie or gingerbread vanilla with a little oak in the backgroundpalate extremely smooth and creamy chocolate a little woody finish long smooth fruit and honey with some spiced oakthis whisky in some ways is a hit or miss someone has to really appreciate it as glen garioch has a flavor profile like no other distillery would absolutely recommend to whisky lovers looking to expand their profile as well as seasoned veterans  this has been a fantastic find great quality well balanced flavors fruity and sweet almost like a gewurtz on the nose and fruity between sips fantastic value as the price here puts in competition with higher end local whiskeys if you like the fruitiness make the effort to track down the canadian lohin mckinnon which kicks up this aspect to 11  superior malt lots of heat sweetness tast and muscles easy to recognize value for money  i discovered this beauty about 3 years ago and it s still as amazing as it was then it takes about 1 3 of the bottle down and letting it sit at that level for a month or two to let the real surprises come out and a complexity that just keeps on giving sweet oaky and a little bit of cr 233 me brulee on the nose and finish a step below cloyingly sweet i can sip this with a dash of water alone or as a precursor to some peated islay s on a flight night slainth 233  nice and simple this stuff is great balananced full bodied glass  i 39 m new to whisky but happy with this bottle the 48 makes it a bit harsh but its smooth otherwise smells of jammy fruits and a touch of caramel i usually drink scotch straight but i found this one was improved by a few drops of water not the best value at it 39 s price of 70 cad though  nose with dark berries mint and a heavenly sherry fog but it 39 s also earthiness there the taste is a full delivery of a taste wave of a kind of metallic caramel and toasted oak and i love oakiness dried fruit hint of plums sherry spice quite long and sweet finish with a salty feeling on the lips 48 is a respectable level but you can drink it neat or with a little spoon of water overall a sweet and well balanced whisky and it has to be one of the very best 12 year old whiskies  i 39 ve had this whisky several times and it has never been a disappointment it 39 s a 12 year old non chillfiltered 48 which is great but it does have colouring added which is not quite so good but don 39 t let that stop you trying this great whisky frankly it should be better known and more popular but i suppose it does come from a highland distillery that 39 s a bit of the beaten whisky track even at 48 it 39 s smooth enough to drink without water but a drop does open it up a bit and lets the sweetness come through a bit more combining well with the toasty oak and dried fruit flavours with a finish that is long and satisfying  bought a 1 liter bottle of this and am glad i did on the nose was sherry and japanese ume shu plum liquor malt and very subtle notes of toffee vanilla and rum on the palate was bourbon cask liquor infused fruit and toffee i also detected of all things a taste like steamed spinach the finish was long and you can taste the cask after a few drops of water more maltiness and the fruit becomes more pronounced let it sit for a few minutes and the aromas really come out healthy 48 abv too  reminds me alot of glendronach especially the 8 yo hielan in comparison to the hielan the 4 yo age difference makes a huge difference in taste the sherry and the bourbon casks are clearly present and make a nice marriage glen garioch is a lot smoother than the hielan and smoother than most glendronach 39 s overall this 39 smoothness 39 does come with a price however gd to me has a bit more character nevertheless i highly reccomended this whisky to any gd fan  rather good this one and at 48 lots of bang for yer buck nice flavours and quite a long finish well worth a try has received 90 100 from ralfy so must be good 128526  each drinker has their own views on tastes smells and looks of each whisky they try some want to drink it some to savour it and others to just enjoy it for what it is all i can say is i was blown away by this as a single malt it was a real surprise i never expected such a taste sensation just sorry it wasn 39 t out of a cut glass tumbler my prefered drinking vessel crafted as carefully as its contents  fastastic whisky punchy fruity lovely long finish and beautifully smooth for a 12yr  my new breakfast scotch  it 39 s wonderful i 39 m thinking it might be my new favourite very flavourful for a highland malt  fantastic if you did a blind tasting you would say it was a lot older than a 12yr old highly recommended took a chance and wow like this alot spicy creamy smooth and lasts a long time i prefer as do my buds that adding a drop of water to it cuts the alcohol just a smidge to make it more enjoyable excellent  similar to an oban with the smoke i find oban is lacking not overly smoky nice spicy taste but very smooth for 48 great find for the price  like this one alot come friday i 39 ll likely get another or two  a perfect marriage between bourbon and whiskey  this is a very good well balanced whisky lovely feel in the mouth strong malt flavour vanilla honey citrus cinnamon and sherry i agree with most of the other reviewers that it represents good value but if you 39 re going to award 5 at this level what are you going to give a really good whisky  extremely good whisky non chill filtered and bottled at 48 no muddled or overpowering flavours just rich clean barley amp honey notes smooth amp creamy very mild sweetness from the bourbon amp sherry perfect for my liking needs just a touch of cold water to tame the 48 strength this is a down to earth whisky with well defined flavours outstanding  among the best 12 year old you can buy  if you like it well balanced fruity and nutty with a touch of vanilla you have found a very nice whisky with good value for money some of the ratings here seems to be made by people who are not familiar with the typical region of scotland and it 39 s products and a whisky without adding some whater will simply not reveal it 39 s real character keep up the good craftsmanship glen garioch  bananas and dried fruit on the nose needs water to open up rich mouth feel a bit oily some oaky spice on delivery clean finish  this little dram took a lot of patience to dissect it definitely needs water to bring out all of the qualities stored inside the 48 strength i noticed no one has presented tasting notes so for what it 39 s worth here is what i found neat nose difficult to find anything at first but after a few minutes there 39 s vanilla butter cream almond amaretto cake icing raisins and very ripe pear palate extremely smooth and creamy but un discernible and very one noted finish quick hot sharp with some spiced oak but quite numbing from the 48 strength with water nose butterscotch cocoa powder damp leather golden raisins gingerbread with honey and delicate florals lingering faintly in the background palate lightly sulphured chocolaty and oaked finish peppered woodiness becomes longer and slightly honeyed with a nip of dryness and quick whiff of smoke at the very very end if you love this great but the sulphured dry peppery notes were a bit much for me in this one  well priced high quality scotch i 39 m not sure that this beats out comparable 10 12 year old offerings from the likes of glenmorangie and others but it 39 s a little like the volvo to their vw if you get me  succulent impulse purchase discovery i m not a fan of the heavy smokey peaty malts so this was a delicious find unfortunately it didn t last long enough to measure the effect of opening and leaving it to stand  bought as a present for me but have to say there are several i d put before this if it helps i love laphroig  popped in distillery today and bought bottle just finished second dram wow just found new favorite very smooth honeylike definitely not typical for a highland whisky yet it has tons of character and it warms like a good scotch whisky should gets better after the bottle s been opened for a couple of days yes this is a treat  sorry forgot to mark it a resounding 10 stars brilliant this is an absolute cracker of a malt the high 48 abv locks in some fabulous rich flavours and tannins matured in quality bourbon and sherry casks it ticks all the boxes for me much better than the nas founders reserve and well worth the small premium my favorite single malt for the money  i got so many retirement gifts that i m not sure who gave me what i must find out who the discerning person was who bought me glen garioch i am careful with malts as i am not a great fan of peat glen garioch is so smooth and has what i would call the real flavour and taste of what i expect of scotch whisky i agree with another reviewer who says he doesn t share glen garioch it is too good to share unless it is with someone who might appreciate it secret pleasure  tried this at a blind tasting one night and was immediately impressed by the smooth rich taste the slow velvet slide as it went down the afterglow is smile inducing and yes please i will have another is ikpossible to stop saying value for money is an understatement have had 6 bottles in the last 18 months and no i dont share it with friends its mine for me to sit and be personally sated with 
2428.0, jw green is a blend but it is a blend of single malts it is what we old guys called a 39 vatted malt 39 meaning a blend of single malts even j w blue is a blend because although there are more expensive and older single malts in the blue there is also single grain spirits not so for the j w green i love the j w blue but for the price of many so so single malts the green hits the sweet spot for value in my opinion  salty finish i have to say this is a good blend i don 39 t like too much smoke but this just about gets it right if i 39 m honest i prefer a few of the single malts around this price range but i enjoyed this and was in no way disappointed  i 39 ve tried red gold black double black amp blue i keep coming back to green the main reason is the blend is well balanced not too anything not too smokey too earthy too much bite and not too smooth either it 39 s my quot baby bear quot of aged scotch whiskeys  for the price it is an honest and fair drink very drinkable definitely would buy it again  at it 39 s price point one of the better blended malts at 43 if it were 46 that would be interesting  a whiskey that welcomes allcomers unchallenging with little finish but this is a quality dram to be poured and enjoyed couple of ice cubes you really cant go wrong at this price point lovely bottle as well  first time tried it last night guess my palette must be different than others cause other than the not burning to bad going down the throat it really wasn 39 t all that i 39 d hoped for these notes that people keep talking about yeah i could smell the peat earthy smell but that 39 s really about it it just doesn 39 t taste that great guess i 39 m not a whiskey drinker oh and look i 39 m out sixty bucks to boot maybe it 39 ll be good for cooking  i 39 m a regular jw black fan and just decided to quot go for it quot one night and buy green look i 39 m not the demo i like bud light i hate bourbon this stuff is good and smooth prob better with ice even however it is a bit sweet you can taste the bit of honey taste i 39 m sorry i can 39 t drink sweet i will go back to jw black sometimes red i 39 m lucky i have pedestrian taste buds it 39 s easier on the wallet i tried business class flying once never again if i want to splurge premium economy i tried an expensive car once never again you see where this is going  really smooth one of the best blended scotches the best of the jw range without a doubt at the price if you can afford to spend a few more buy this instead of the black label it is far superior i pour a glass and ad just a drop or two of water  i got a bottle circa 2015 from someone in the internet probable a garage sale all four malts are clearly discernible now if you expect a peat bomb or shockwaves of smoke wrong place this is still a blend in all the house style and glory but leaning towards the complexity of skye and islay and less of that clogging sweetness that drowns the 18 that said this is very good stuff layered balanced and excellent for its price point at least in my market where there 39 s not a whole lot of options  very nice test i like very much best jw green is something i had some years back and honestly dont recall why i havnt picked it up in a long time i suppose its because black is my go to scotch and lets face it it always comes back to to black it just works for any occasion and mood that being said i recently picked up green again and after sipping said asked myself why havnt i maintained this stock in my cabinet its just simply pout scotch whiskey done really well for me this is the one to slowly sip and savor perhaps with a good cigar while with a backdrop of sinatra or dino 39 s vocals to join the mood without the price point of blue and yet in my opinion with every bit of worthiness more after taste than blue but thats what in my opinion makes it one to savor because the finish is welll what a good scotch whiskey should be unfortunately as others may have mentioned its not so easy to find and its price point while imo much more worthy than blue is still significantly more than black sometimes i wonder if its so hard to come by then how do they still produce and sell it but i hope they always do and will we can always ask our local retailer to order it for us and obtain it that way my recent find was in a store where i was buying other things and saw it on the shelf and also on sale im going back just to get a couple more at the price anyway this is imo probably the best of the bunch from the brand not something i can always replenish like the for always cant ever go wrong black but for the special occasions and moods green has that special place and im always going to be certain i have some in my cabinet  tasting notes from the label which states quot a rich amp robust blend of only single malts including talisker linkwood cragganmore amp caol ila quot this is from a 50ml miniature bottle bought tonight i am learning to test whiskies when i can as there is so much garbage out there their wonderful stalwart black label was changed had the heart ripped out of it then seemed to get it back by about 70 still worth buying just let 39 s hope jw are listening who am i kidding their mbas never think past the next quarterly report first impressions nice nose quite assertive and quite complex i am now certain that there is a quot mouthfeel consultant quot at jw as this is something which they seem to have concentrated on in the last couple of years this is often to disguise the lack of heart or quality in a blend as whisky makers all over scotland are told by ceos to cut costs no matter how it affects the final product quot don 39 t worry we 39 ve got a great marketing department quot however it is pleasant taste this is an upfront blend for a vatted dram at this price lots of outside of the teeth action a decent level of oil sweet but not overly so a little dry some peat overall this is perfectly decent it has its own taste and it stays with you for longer than you might suspect but then it drops of a cliff with nothing but a barley sugar residue somebody with real talent has been given a brief i am certain they resent it initially seems to be the real deal but there has been some cost cutting and not that much i 39 d estimate that jw have saved themselves about 11 of their costs and reduced the quality of this whisky by 8 not bad if all you care about is your next bonus right now it is enjoyable worth buying god knows what it will taste like in a few years i recommend stocking up  im a jw drinker a friend since my eary 20 39 slately of all the jws the green and the 18s are my lover drinks  when this was very briefly 25 quid at the shops i bought a bottle in terms of overall quality and value it is probably my fave jw product i m too much of a stingebag to shell out 40 notes on a regular basis for it though  i last had a bottle of this in 2014 and the briney iodine from talisker cereal from linkwood refined mouthfeel from cragganmore and oily smoke from caol ila were all evident it was sublime for a vatted malt got a bottle recently a little let down tbh still an excellent vat at this price point but where 39 s the smoke and salty iodine brine gone i was so excited to pull the cork on this but now feel a bit let down still a great skilled blend just not the quirkiness of old  i drank this in a side by side with wemyss 39 s hive and balvenie 39 s carribean cask as reference i can 39 t agree with the above description the nose is really quite thin and bland compared to the other two and the palate cheap and smoky and tastes like the blended scotches my parents used to buy not bad but nothing special quite drinkable but there are far better for very little extra cost  this is the best johnnie walker better than blue gold black hands down the nose palate and finish is just amazing superb dram  jw green is my favourite every day scotch and i definately prefer the new 2016 version over the old 2010 discontinued one my a mile cause the new is sweeter and a bit more fruity and has a much more dominant dark chocolate taste on my palate you could get 4 bottles of these for the price of one standard bottle of jw blue what i 39 ve tried as well but was deeply disappointed especially for it 39 s huge price tag  maybe it was a nice malt in 2010 but not good now harsh can 39 t find the flavors has some body not really bad but you can find much better ones for that price  delicious a decidedly pleasant vatted malt with just the right amount of peat rich coffee and malt flavors with a touch of chocolate and spice on the finish has always been a favorite among the johnnie walker whiskies  m of m kindly gifted me so one of this to try well here goes my first taste of jw green blend and 15years of aging nose rich complex a touch of burnt wood and some milky chocolate palate fairly oaky dry but more chocolate finish sweet and rich with plenty spice fairly long too overall not a bad dram at all and for the money a very nice find i would consider buying a bottle in future well done considering its a blend  great complex tasting whisky with an array of robust flavours best of all the johnny walker ranges much much better whisky than the over rated blue label  very nice for the price intense nose and flavors definitely worth a try the only thing that disappoints me a bit is the rather short finish especially compared to others in this price range e g dewar 39 s 15 or 18  spiced almond with hints of smoked carmel and toffee on the palate sweet mouth watering finish that lingers well after the final sip this expression closes in on the obiquitous and indelible blue label at a third of the price  smooth with not much peat and a nice smokey flavor the finish is a bit bitter but that is only the first sip the second sip is perfect i pour over some crushed ice and a bit of water it is a wonderful balance for a scotch the blend is always the same bottle to bottle no variation  this is my favourite whisky i a novice that thought that single malt always meant superior got a perfect rebuff by this complex deep and expertly put together blend if it stays like this i could drink this to my dying day  lovely stuff sweet oily complex and with a whif of pear smoke don t be a single snob and give it a try  the nose is rich with faint peat smoke and also bonfire smoke some coffee and black chocolate notes as well on the palate it is malty with nutty nuances very complex with bitter chocolate notes the finish is long sweet and spicy this 15 years vatted malt whisky is supposed to gain a great deal of recognition to my belief as it does not contain any grain whiskies opposed to the company 39 s other label whiskies  i love it but difficult to find the old green was fantastic wonderful complex whisky full of different flavours thoroughly recommend smooth on the palate green is a nice scotch  i was soooo unhappy that green label was discontinued happy to see it return however the old green label was very robust and smoky flavor sorry to say the new green label is lighter less smoky and sweeter to the taste i still have 2 bottles of the old green which i now cherish and will savor sparingly for as long as i can make them last if this new green is only a quot limited release quot i do hope they will bring back the original recipe as green label is the best  i really love this stuff it is perfect and complex it is sweet fruity smokey and has that lovely coffee and dark chocolate on the finish be careful this stuff is easy to drink  sweet fruit lots of spice mellow smoke oily with pepper on the finish opens up with water to sherry and toffie  submitted a review a couple of days ago i came back to reiterate how good this whisky is so well balanced some dried fruit sultanas on the nose with that sweet fruity pang of sherry trifle too nutty and syrupy too on the palate it 39 s a smorgasbord of fresh apple and pear lots of esters along with the smoke and nuts finish is nice very smooth i 39 d rather pay another few guid for this than jb black label  love this great balance if you 39 ve not tried a blend before then this should convince you of their worthiness  it 39 s funny most really like it and some don 39 t think it 39 s worth it it 39 s a nice scotch to drink while watching a game i can think of many better scotches to serve friends you can 39 t take money with you buy the best you can and what you like you deserve it i recommend 21 yr old littlemill if you can get it or a cheap bottle of a blend is okay too  to echo the last reviewer i will not be purchasing any more of green label i 39 ve had at least 3 bottles within the last 2 3 years my bottle of a recent batch with the new label is significantly poorer and harsher than previous bottles far less on the nose and palate a real shame  the box and the labels on the bottle are different and i 39 ll almost swear the quality of this jw green has dropped for me the latest batch is less peated and sweeter than the previous batch imo it 39 s got a lot less talisker in it and probably less caol ila it leaves a bitter aftertaste on the roof of my mouth and back of my throat that i do not like at all i will not buy any more of this latest batch and search out any older stock it simply is not worth it now  the best whisky i 39 ve ever drank it 39 s about 36 euros and something in the supermarket but better than any whisky under 50 euros like balvenie 12yo you don 39 t buy a 15yo pure malt elsewhere it uses 4 single malts and drinking it is like listening to beethoven 39 s string quartet  first of all be aware that i am not a blend drinker and i have usually about 30 to 40 single malt in my collection mostly peated islay whisky my favorites are laphroaig and lagavulin i like to try new stuff and i heard so many positive reviews on this green label well i had to buy a bottle men this is really good i mean considering the price it is almost perfect very well balance with a big and fresh honney taste spicy on the aftertaste and so easy me and my mates will have our yearly quot whisky night quot at xmas holiday and i will provide this one for the blind test i am quiet sure they will very very surprised jw knows is job that 39 s for sure  just opened up a bottle i got a gift and i feel like it s got potential if some air gets in the bottle over time i m comparing this to my two other johnnie bottles that i m most familiar with gold and black my initial thoughts are that while it doesn t have the smokiness of johnnie gold 18 it doesn t drown into saltiness with water like johnnie gold 18 does it seems to be a decent blend that doesn t burn the tongue like black does and also doesn t have the somewhat oily taste that black can have it s good but overall i feel like just seems to come up short and is missing something as my summary states maybe it needs to breathe a bit over time  distant smoke creamy sweet i dont get bitter finish that some report pretty delicate no burn chocolate and coffee dominates but nothing extraordinary oak on milder side definitelly deeply soaked oak if you know what i mean pleasant not aggressive a classical music rather than a rock song good solid sipper good for special occasions to share or to enjoy in privacy not far from his younger brother 12 black but less bite try to get it in 1l bottles in travel retail i paid 40e for mine at eu airport steal  this is my favourite blended scotch whisky by a long shot it 39 s easy to drown in the mentality that single malt whiskies are the only ones worth buying but i challenge you purists to venture into the realm of blends by starting with this one you 39 re in for a pleasant surprise with its bold yet smooth posture through vatting the four single malts marry really nicely and they are each a flagship on their own i 39 d much rather spend 150 on 3 on these bottles than on one bottle of blue lable  my quot house whisky quot best value for money and also in the top when it comes to absolute terms a whisky with an age statement all 15 yr all malt no grain 43 is the minimum i would accept for a whisky so its oki was lucky that during the time it was discontinued in eu it was still available in taiwan while i lived in china so i never dried out now that it is back it tastes for me a bit more intense in generalbut with the same character i like so much a more single malt scottish whisky light peaty sweet and full having its own personality with feelings kept in mind for endless time affordable price decent and pretty jwgl cheers  this comes across much like a single malt layered and complex just enough smoke for my tastes and a nice balance of sweetness and spice best jw for the money will always keep a bottle in my cabinet why buy the blue when you can get multiples of this for the same money  да смесь сильно отличается от johnnie walker pure malt quot vatet malt quot так как давно привратилась в quot blended malt quot тут люди пытаются писать что придедусчея версия зелёной этикетки сильно отличается от это ну ладна мол talisker много а caol ila мало качество в целом не то а как насчёт разных партий отвратительных в адной партии мне попалос только со вкусом cragganmore в общем и вцелом отвратителная продукция джони кроме blue label  couldn 39 t agree more with the review titled 39 green is johnny walker 39 s greatest blend 39 from may 2017 i started with the green line by chance while passing thru duty free picked up island green simply amazing i 39 ve been thru all the mainline jws as well as the blue label blue is well overpriced i prefer a single malt budget allowing but island green is their closest thing and best offering while green label remains a close second for me for those jw 39 anti blend haters 39 give the green labels a try you may be surprised  i ve recently bought a bottle of this one with the twist off cap batch 666769 date 08 12 16 04 02 06 it s a very good whisky indeed but it doesn t have the peat smokey note on the nose i could only get a very weak almost fading salt and sea notes certanly from talisker fruity and earthy grass notes even on the palate maybe the recently batches were added more caol ila to the mix to reveal a more peat smoke notes on the palate and on the nose my guess is that my bottle was from the old taiwan s exclusive batch before the revealing of it coming back to the global market because the shape of the bottle is a bit different and doesn t have a cork only a twist off cap maded from plastic even from the old batches it s an awesome whisky of course it lacks a bit of character and power from caol ila and talisker but it 39 s a very enjoyable bit complex and very drinkable one maybe if bottled at 46 abv it would be even more richer and complex  i didn 39 t realize this was back in play until my girlfriend messaged me on a snowboarding trip askin if i 39 d tried it i laughed and told it was discontinued and she told me she found one albeit the newest bottling this stuff is amazing every time amazing considering what you are getting in the blend and how much talisker has changed as of recent years what a bonus long story short i adore this whisky and i adore my now fi 225 nce cheers  this is a smooth very drinkable malt that has taken the number one place on my sideboard presently  this is my 39 house 39 scotch actually like it better then blue but when you 39 re culling whiskey  drinking it now omggg is soooo good and soooo smooth too straight no ice with this cold weather is just warming my whole body lol lol cheers and happy new year to everyone from ft hood tx 12 30 2017  other than gold label a beautiful whisky like all johnnie walker whisky the best  one of the smoothest whiskies i have tasted a great price for a great whisky i have tasted loads of whisky 39 s over the years and after my brother gave me this for my birthday i buy this for all my inlaws who like a dram not one of them has refused another smooth on the pallet great citrus tang and mellow afterglow a great find this will become very popular  това не е великия малц на койтоджим мъри награди с огромните 95т на този уви само етикета му остана  absolutely stunning blend but with quality notes received as gift but omg this dram is outstsnding not having tried the original green label blend i find this to be a smooth balanced and rewarding dram better than both black labels to my taste great mouthfeel and the lovely smoke comes through with a sweet dryness finish although short inspires the desire for another sip  a good malt blend with sweetness and smokiness and a great alternative to the more expensive single malts to me jwgl delivers plenty of bang for buck with a few drops of water this whisky has almost everything you need from a drink very enjoyable and i drink it when i want something special  i love smoke and peat and i wasn 39 t deceived you can definitely taste the highlands behind the islay flavors and it 39 s great highland and islay flavors are notable in a great blended with quality smoothness and complexity at an unbeatable price point well done  my fave perfect breakfast scotch  the original green label was my wife 39 s favourite scotch i loved it too for its smoothness balance and complexity and we were very disappointed when it was discontinued a few years ago luckily i 39 d kept about a third of a bottle of the old stuff and was able to compare it with the newer version we actually bought six bottles at 80 each when it was re released in australia as the retailer told us that it was a limited release and once it was gone it was gone you can now find it easily for 60 or less i still have five bottles left as the newer version is a touch harsher quite sharp and peppery on the initial taste and has a slightly bitter finish it 39 s great to see the original four malts still being used but the blend is different to me adding a small amount of water helps as does rolling it around in the mouth a little before swallowing will i sell the remaining four bottles or give them away as presents not likely as it 39 s still a good if not great whisky  i absolutely do not like the after taste of the green label black label is better to me out of all the johnnie walker line i think the platinum is the best not quite smoky or peaty it has a strong citrus orange cake smell imo one of the best  my favorite of all the jw range that i have tried those attainable without needing to take out a loan  i never expected johnnie walker whisky to taste so nice maybe because i start with the wrong foot my first taste of jw was the red label which i remember some 30 years was rather unpleasant it has the oaky note that doesn 39 t gel very well with the lightweight maltiness at least it doesn 39 t work for me being a vatted malt whisky the green label has complex notes and a decent dose of smoke very enjoyable and it restored my faith in jw i have also tasted the black label which sits between the red and green label i have not tried the blue label but my friends tell me not to bother given it 39 s price green label has become my quot go to quot sipping whisky because i find most single malts are over priced don 39 t get me wrong they are tasty especially the macallans and bowmore but a tad too expensive to be your daily dram during wintry nights i have a collection of single malts that i drink if i want something special people tell me the island green is even better i 39 ll get some when i next travel  when i opened the bottle i was very excited it smelt amazing sweet and smokey like a black label but more complex the initial taste was very good with fruity spice but the finish completely ruined it for me there 39 s a very unpleasant pepper aftertaste which is really bitter also after a few sips i began to find the mix of flavours also a bit nauseating not as good as black label in my opinion but each to their own  forget the overpriced blue label this is the jewel of the johnnie walker stable  pleasant nose nay exquisite nose complex palate woody a tad sweet  i don 39 t agree with the description above maybe it 39 s not the same whisky it was at 2010 specially at palate it taste a bit spice like pepper  if anyone is traveling internationally check out johnnie walker quot island quot green label a special duty free release which has a slightly different blend mixing in a little bit more of the smokey isla malts to give it an extra punch i bought a case of old green label prior to its discontinuation it was temporarily discontinued world wide because the recipe was starting to noticeably change as some ingredients were falling into short supply towards the end it was a bit less smokey than the original recipe after supplies were allowed to be replenished green label was relaunched returning to the original recipe in full measure personally i can sense very little difference between the old and the new i always tell me friends that if you were to have a theoretical scale of 1 10 for smokiness the last batch of old green was maybe a 4 new green is maybe a 5 and quot island quot green is about a 5 5 it 39 s an interesting exercise to taste all three back to back i honestly think that this is the greatest blend of all time being what was previously called a quot vatted quot malt this is a blend of 100 single malts and not a drop of the cheapo grain whisky this green label should inspire people to be adventurous and try mixing together 2 or 3 of their favorite single malts which they think might go well together get a nice 350ml decanter and fill it up with three or four single malts from different distilleries and let them get to know each other for a few months and then see what happens  for me this is decent considering it is a blended whisky smooth with hint of wood and sweet notes the finish is spicy and not as long as i like it to be this is a good choice if blue label is too pricey dont think it should be a 95 pointer though  nothing spectacular quite sweet good for beginners smooth finish  i 39 m giving this whisky such a high rating because of its value the age statement gives some intrinsic value and the price makes it incredible i 39 ve had the blue a few times but i doubt i 39 ll ever buy a bottle of it while the green 15 is as good as it is for nearly a quarter the price price aside it has amazing flavor especially for a blended it 39 s slightly delicate for a jw but it does not disappoint  the new green label tastes totally different to the previous version very disappointed  seriously the best of the jw coloured range not quite the amazing and flavourful beast that the green of old was but a welcome return of a favourite and still punching well above its price range certainly an excellent vatted malt and with single malts becoming rarer and more expensive stands to become a standard house tipple for those who appreciate good whisky  i was a long time fan of the jw black until i discovered green fell in love at the first sip and it 39 s been my go to ever since still can 39 t believe how cheap it is for the quality nice to see it sweep the board at the international whisky competition 2016 awards sweet and smoky complexity i 39 ve got 6 tucked away in storage just in case they discontinue it again  many people rated the previous incarnation of jw green in hallowed terms and some say that the new expression is inferior i can only comment on this new version which is a solid blended malt an oft underrated category in my opinion but hardly special there is a good dose of smoke on the nose and infused with the palate presumably by virtue of the talisker and caol ila influences there is also a healthy whiff of sulphur not the rank guff acquired from tainted sherry casks but the milder cordite influence that indicates less copper contact during the distillation process upon checking yes cragganmore distillery uses the old style wormtub condensers i understand this results in a robust full bodied whisky with a honey sweet edge and all those characteristics are certainly true of this expression the finish has good length too however the wood and spice are a bit of a bludgeon at 15 years of age i 39 d like a touch more maturity and subtlety  all the character is washed out to not disturb anyone a trick learned from coca cola this whisky is no different and not worth the price stick to real single malts and drink slower come to think of it this might be improved with a splash of coca cola  best whiskey for such price imo green is better than the overpriced and overrated blue not a big fan of jw in general but this one is different and really unique tasted it first time in 2013 got myself the new version now i think it even got better amazing whiskey recommended  solid dram for the price doesn 39 t touch most 15 year single malts but very enjoyable for the price and better than plenty 12 years in the same range basically like a really smooth version of talisker with a little extra brought a 1l back from barcelona in the duty free for the same price as this 70cl bottle bought it primarily due to the talisker and caol ila parts i 39 d never really drank cragganmore and certainly never had linkwood knowingly before i think i appreciate the speysides more in this blend the former two provide that peaty oaky whallop that i 39 d expect but the speysides provide a more floral sweeter note there is a definite chocolatey after taste i couldn 39 t really detect any walnut but the coffee espresso taste is quite prevalent all in a super smooth blend and one i 39 d definitely look for again  first tasted while i was in delhi in the year 2000 and instantly liked it and tried it again and again and derived pleasure of it pleasant surprise it 39 s again here  tried it again and again and it always delivers on flavour and experience remarkably complex for its price  at around 60 where i 39 m from it 39 s a bargain compared to the gold and as far as i 39 m concerned it 39 s every bit as good as the over priced blue which runs around 185 in my area as a matter of fact i believe i 39 ll invest in a dozen bottles this week incase they decide to stop making it again  smooth complex and mature and for this price you cant complain  this is a great 15 yo whisky for the money based on reviews i was expecting something a little bit unusual for jw but not if you like blue label and platinum you should like this green as well it has the same flavor profile but more intense you get the same kind of sweetness as the blue label but then instead of the soft peat flavor comes a pepperiness kick reminding you that there is no grain whisky and it 39 s 43 great in my opinion if you are a black label fan you can 39 t be sure about liking this but if you like me only like the bl or platinum you will definitely like this green especially useful to alternate between sherried single malts depending on your mood  loved this it 39 s a notch up from the gold label but i still preferred black label overall a sharper more traditional taste i enjoyed a bottle over a week the only way i think to get an overall impression of the taste is there a better whisky in the world for the price  i want to make it simple johnnie walker green label is one of the best vatted malt i ever had and master of malt is for me one of the greatest seller i live in the us but i am their client as well they do a such great service and i am very happy with my last purchase of 3 johnnie walker green label bottles fast shipping and professional package i encourage anyone to buy from them alysson osco real good  discovered this gem about four years ago after a long run of only single malts i only knew the johnnie walker brand with the red amp black label and of course big blue johnnie walker green label changed all that and i have become a big johnnie walker fan with double black being my poor man 39 s substitute for the vanishing green label over the past couple of years now that the green is back on the shelf hopefully not some sick joke i 39 m back in the saddle with this fine tasty drink and very happy go green i have found a liquor stores that is selling this ridiculously low priced at 49 99 usd plus tax i have 4 bottles hidden away and i pick up whenever they have them not going to say the store where i found them  the first time i sampled this grog was some years ago i sat there smelling it for about 10 minutes before i even tasted it that was the old pre 97 lot i still think that was better than the current offering though the new stuff in 70 cl bottles is still quite fine i like it as well as most single malts and better than any blend i also approve of the 43 alcohol rather than 40  always been a fan of the jw black got me into whisky that one but tried this for the first time have to say i am impressed the talisker and cragganmore really stand out for me very well balanced and the nose is malty prunes tobacco coffee and a smoky peaty tang i could spend a good while nosing this one always a bit dubious of paying so much for a 39 generic 39 blend but this is well worth it imo fine neat but a touch of water opens up the more floral notes and seems to bring out more of the smoke can 39 t compare to older bottling but this is a fine whisky and more rewarding 39 than some single malts i 39 ve tried  waited a while for this but it 39 s now wonderfully available again typical jw smoothness they are truly skilful blenders perfectly balanced between sweet cereal malt a spicy finish and a lovely warming hint of smoke i don 39 t know the malts that are blended here but i think i 39 m detecting caol ila in the mix it 39 s not as exciting or punchy as some other vatted malts spice tree for example but it 39 s certainly of a superior quality than the perfectly drinkable monkey shoulder or sheep dip jw as always feels and tastes professional but not clinical individuality on an industrial scale it 39 s quite a trick to pull but they do it with style here  i 39 ve been a long time jw black fan i love the deep smoky flavor and it is usually available at most establishments however jw green is unbelievable for a blended scotch smooth delicious and a fantastic finish i 39 m headed back to the store to buy up the rest of their stock never can have too much i 39 ve shelved my balvenie for this blend if you 39 ve never had it buy it and enjoy you will not be disappointed  i was so sad when they stopped production a couple of years ago and have jealously protected my last 2 bottles as soon as i learned it was back on the market i ordered a couple more and will now be a happy man for many nights to come  loved it lucky to get one really smooth  the best blended i drank really smooth with a sweet entry taste comparable with those much expensive single malt versions wonderful stuff can 39 t believed that it is a blended the other really good stuff is gold label from jw as well  magnificent drop the best of all johnnies without any doubt i was saving this bottle for xmas and it is worth every minute waiting even when to get a bottle of this heavenly scotch is almost impossible now and quite expensive go for it if you can this drop has everything spiciness fruitiness vanilla peat you name it there is no grain taste like in other walkers vatted mix so you can really enjoy the full malty flavor  and i grab bottles whenever available wish it would come back into north america distribution  i don 39 t like blended whiskeys i prefer old single malts or bourbon firewaters but this is something else so smooth and subtle it works as a sipper or a whackback if you like a potent peaty or smokey whisky you might find this a disappointing drink and you could feel cheated at nearly ninety quid for a bottle but if you want to drink the most skilfully blended silky smooth whisky ever made treat yourself to this  this is the best malt blend i ever tasted period  lo mejor de johnnie walker lastima que ya esta descontinuado un tesoro para quien tengas alguna botella celosamente guardada  best of the group gold label reserve is pretty good as well but cost much more was disappointed with the blue label and the platinum label if i can 39 t get green label i will stick with the red label which i find to be very interesting with a young spicy flavor and a hint of peat and a great price do not care for the black label some people may like the smoky flavor but i find it smoky to the point of almost charred johnny walker please please please bring back the green label for north america  i 39 d have to say that this is the nicest whisky i 39 ve ever tasted i refer to the newer release not the one in the photo above it has a smoky taste and a hazy appearance when water and ice are added i 39 ve recently had jw platinum double black and glenlivet 12 year old and i much prefer the green label over any of these i 39 ve now cleaned out 3 bottle shops in my town and if you 39 ve half a mind you 39 ll get down and pick up whatever you can in this limited release  all i can say is wow tried a new version of this the re release 2015 version wow wow wow i just had a dram of glenlivet 18 before this and i hate to admit it but i think the johnnie green is better in terms of flavour and delivery nose is quite full lots of sweet cereal notes palate is nice and creamy super smooth and then moves to a dry medium slighty smoky finish i can say that the 2015 version is very sweet like it is very sweet it dosen 39 t have much peat and smoke flavor just a bit it tastes like a really sweet speyside malt with lots of body and tad of smoke if you 39 re feeling for a sweet full flavoured rich dram this is for you good stuff  i feel that johnnie walker green is one of the best whiskies ever produced it has a lovely smooth taste and a great rich aroma it is best served on its own for maximum flavour and worth every penny of the price  i 39 m giving this a rating of 10 stars as there is no 9 5 rating and it really does deserve it this edition is just terrific i picked up a bottle and drank from it two nights in a row went back to get more and they had sold out on the day i bought it apparently now where do i get more it 39 s really great on the nose the flavor develops with just wonderful balance and everything you could expect from a whisky and it is so much cheaper than what i normally drink when i pick it up i thought what 39 s the harm it 39 s only a bottle of johnnie walker but it 39 s so much more how is something like this in a johnnie walker line up as to the guy that prefers black label which is just average staggers me this is no ordinary whisky and i love tasting whisky  i try but the black label taste better than the green label i live in florida and never tried the original green label i got into drinking scotch after got discontinued i was happy to see it coming back into u s market this year in 2015 it 39 s readily available in many places for around 60 but it 39 s the new version and i 39 m enjoying it very much also stock piling for future you never know well back to my main point after almost giving up on finding the original pre 2011 version even searching internet and international pages to my surprise there was one bottle left in a back storage overlooked in my local liquor store i was so excited i bought it right away for a normal price crappy thing is now i have to wait for a special occasion to taste it cheers many years ago found the green superb sad at its ending found it again just sampled the new release back came all of the great feelings of sipping a wonderful single blended malt i hope it continues  according to official jw facebook page they are going to re release the green label throughout australian selected retail shops in the next 2 3 coming weeks i 39 m a single malt guy personally but i 39 m aware enough to know that i needed to find this stuff after looking around it was nowhere to be found until i stumbled upon 6 bottles at a local liquor warehouse store i bought 2 bottles for 46 a piece which i think is a steal it 39 s very good scotch and i 39 m quite impressed with the full flavor and smoothness i think i 39 m going to go back and buy one or two more as an investment because i don 39 t see it listed on the jw website with their other labels so i believe it is discontinued and may be worth something in the future also it doesn 39 t hurt to have something this tasty lying around for desperate times  i recently found 4 bottles in vientiane lao and snatched them all up at a price about the same as black would cost here in thailand it seems not as fragrant as i recall from 5 years ago perhaps my nose has decayed yet it still rolls on my tongue like velvet tadpoles  i 39 m with you and your comments about is being a little different from the original green i like so much tastes a lot like black label although i think the double black is as good if not better than the new release of jonnie walker green i found this at costco probably won 39 t buy it again and just go for the double black for blended scotch my preference is for a single malt  yes i saw a few people are finding it in taiwan apparently they have a small operation still producing the original for taiwan only they just released it again for internationally though in the new bottle i got a bottle and tried it i 39 m not sure what to think though i have the feeling it is a new blend because i remember looooooving this scotch before it was discontinued and now meh it 39 s fine but i was missing that old warm balance and complexity that i remembered maybe my palet has changed but it tasted a lot more like the red and black labels to me so i 39 ll probably go back to my ballentines 18 year for the same price which is what i switched to when they discontinued after a little cry anyone else feel the same way or am i way off  i also found a bottle they had three in my local store i picked one up and yes the bottle does seem to be different from the original it 39 s basically the same bottle and label as the black just with a different top  i was surprised to find 6 new bottles at my local store the bottle was of a different shape and label slightly different that what i am used to is diageo re releasing it in the us market  i just found one in downtown saigon i know it is legit as i have been buying my scotches from this man for years he sold it at the original price of approximately 30usd very excited to keep this tucked away i have had it before and honestly prefer black label above all others my rating is based on prior experience  i am used to single malts so i was surprised to see this whilst on holiday in taiwan 10us and it sells for 400 on ebay in australia it 39 s a lovely sweet complex drink though will take some home  i got this one johnnie walker pure malt extra special pure highland malt whisky from kilmarnock scotland i don 39 t need it if you want you can buy it  there is still lots of gl in taiwan market it just like the abc whisky in tw found 4 on a dusty shelf opened one enjoyable but prefer double black myself will save the others to the collection  my local abc store has upwards of 10 bottals and so do many other stores im my area over the last few months a online supplier in nz has been sending pallets of the stuff to high end residents of australia paying upwards nearly double the price today i managed to import myself a case of now this rare scotch i ve seen it on ebay of 499 and upwards per bottle and ppl are saying it s a very good investment holiday at the black sea in small town pomorie and there it was jw gl dusty box but in perfect condition bought it and two makers mark at a total of us 110 o  never tasted it but since its discontinued i thought it would be an excellent investment opportunity 6 months ago it sold for zar 600 and now sells for zar1800 each in south africa lets see what happens in 5 10 yrs  recently got into scotch whisky and somehow was able to find one bottle at a local liquor store unfortunately there was only one so i will probably not be sampling it unless i can find another  well i have a few bottles and love drinking a bit each night and will be sorry when i can no longer purchases any at least there is jw swing not the same but i like it too thanks  bought a bottle yesterday for 163 32 is this still being produced i m thinking it is in reduced quantities  as a single malt fan i needed convincing it s good i bought six bottles only 163 35 here in london  just found 20 bottles in the duty free shop in the small airport kangerlussuaq in greenland if any of you should get through there 70 for a 1ltr bottle  i live in the south american country which is the largest importer of scotch whisky per capita in the world in downtown ciudad del este today just one of the many stores that stock johnnie walker had 75 bottles of green they are 75 a piece mind you  i reside in taiwan and its abundant at every store which sells alcohol at a price roughly abouve 30 us explination for the discontinued and why its still located here taiwan is the 6th largest scotch whiskey consuming country in the world despite its extremely small size the green label is still widely available here for two reasons 1 whiskey and cognac companies market the premium brands of their lines making the higher priced products here as an example hennessy vsop is the standard vs literally cant be found anywhere in this country the lowest quality is black and that actually costs more than vsop i ve looked and had to have regular vs imported as a result of this branding green label isn t viewed as a premium brand thus it hasn t been marketed very well it can be found at every 7 11 welcome family mart and carrefour everyone of them reason number 2 discontinuation of the green label was phased in it wasn t discontinued here when it was initially discontinued in the us thus there is still a significant surplus green label just as the original gold label have years stated on them 15 and 18 accordingly as the demand of jw whiskey has risen and the company didn t anticipate this demand long ago there is a shortage of the contents to create these blends as a strategic move the company is releasing lower quality whiskey gold label reserve no year on the bottle maintaining the same price as the original while its creating new brands at higher prices platinum which maintain the same year as its predecessors at a much higher cost recognizing the fact that both the original gold label not reserve and green label don t exist in america and will wont be here over the course of the next few years as well have started to seek avenues to export to the us however right now i am hitting road blocks and have a feeling that i will have to result to transporting them in my luggage during return trips  i should add that the buyer had not heard that green label had been discontinued and said she thought her supplier would have more soon since i bought them out i left my name and number and told her i would return to buy whatever she could get if she would hold it for me on the way out of town i checked two other large liquor stores and neither even had a facing for green label  everywhere i go i look for green label which has always been difficult to find yesterday in the back of the liquor section of a wal mart i found five bottles of johnnie walker green label for 59 per bottle and bought them all  not a regular of blended whiskey but have been inspired by the commentsmade will save them both for a special day  i got 4 bottle on march 4th 2014 when heard that it was discontinued this is by far the best jw label  it is a true shame this bottle is going away i wish i had discovered it long ago as it were nobody ever carried the green label let alone even knew about it yet when i finally ordered a bottle through my local store i found a bottle i could enjoy regularly unfortunately that first bottle was all i got before finding out it was discontinued luckily i found a case and snatched it up recently still i believe green would have done so much better if it were given as much press as the others especially gold the best in my opinion  was able to find a couple bottles here in the philippines being a remote country not many people know about green label and store owners don t realize it s discontinued they also don t price it as high as those who know that it s no longer produced so i grabbed the opportunity must say as a newbie to scotch whisky i see patterns about a whisky with a lot of hype that always gets shot down by critics not here all the reviews i see are positive meaning it must be that good i don t know if it s just the power of suggestion but i tried it with my limited palate and i loved it will be stocking up on this  haven t tried this for a long time but worth every penny i usually stick to a variety of malts especially islay but stray to a quality blend occasionally this qualifies as quality i was on a business trip to taiwan and saw the green label commonly available in convenient stores and groceries like carrefour bought a small sample bottle of 200ml to try out being a single malt lover and over on the peaty side i was surprised by it s aroma and richness especially long aftertaste i almost couldn t believe it s a johnny walker no offence by the way but the best part about this scotch is its price one of the best value out there  i found two bottles in my local tesco recently 28th dec 2013 very dusty boxes but i bought both for 163 30 each one to enjoy and one to put into my collection  i love a nice blue but this is almost as good at a terrific price i much prefer this over the gold highly recommended and friends who aren t yet ready for a single malt take to green straight away  i love this stuff late at night wife gone to bed and just the cat for company glad to see there are so many other fans of this great whisky a friend prefers double black which i also like a lot but this has the edge i think  certainly the best jw and one of the best whiskeys on malt with very good price i always miss you green you were great  good drop smooth jw style but more complex taste very good stuff perhaps the best of the jw range gold platinum ans blue also good and black is a standard for a cost effective blend shame it s been discontinued still some bottles out there asda milton keyes where i most recently found it 32 quid 7 bottles left so i have 3 of those as not sure how long it will be around for good drinkable scotch smoother than a lot of single malts at this price point and very drinkable only negative is slightly too sweet so me at a time is enough but good start to go onto a more complicated drop to finish off a night  picked up a bottle as the marketing states this will no longer be made and that this was a vatted whiskey from distillerys of single malts that i do like i m hoping that as it sits it improves the nose is the only thing going for it the taste is quot meh quot but the finish is faintly skunky very disappointed by the hype reviews may be the only amp last blend that i try for a vatted pure malt not a blend this whisky is just great full stop imho not to be compared to either the 4 main whiskies in this green label vatting or the best of the malts which are out there will be missed dearly i m lucky to have some bottles though  got a bottle yesterday excellent i found this to be technically wonderful a great aroma and complex taste and finish but for some reason it just makes me sick its got a nauseating blend of flavors that just dont seem like they were ever meant to meet i seem to be in the minority here but its not fantastic  why they would want to discontinue such a great whisky i ll never understand but i bought the last eight bottles my store had in stock  a vatted malt the best from the stable so far should have never been discontinued green is the way to go av rampersad trinidad west indies  just tried this whiskey for the first time i love the sweetness and spice very easy to drink stocked up with a few bottles before it becomes hard to find  one of the best pure malts has been discontinued a big loss for all malt maniacs  but this one is good best jw ever it is okay i prefer the double black for that extra smokeyness or the platinum for just a higher quality cheers  while i love all the blends some more than others green label is by far the best of them all even blue label specially for the price you cannot beat how great this tastes with just a couple ice cubes rough at first but after a few minutes of the ice melting becomes very smooth and satisfying  this is the kind of scotch you must have with a good cigar but if you re not a smoker it s still a great scotch but with the two together the taste and felling is amazing  good but could be better just found green label in my local supermarket 163 30 happy days jw changing bottle colour to green so will see it again soon  same price range and same points what do you think  i love jw and this is a stand alone from the others truely a great blend even better than the gold in my opinion i ll have to stock up if true  any suggestions since this is gonna be discontinued  there may be others you find more interesting there may be times you need a peat or smoke fix or want something really light but nothing out there is as complete and balanced as this  what a great blend this is what a great great whiskey  so sad that this great dram is being discontinued  it is really complex multidimensional nose is fresh with fruity smoke tropical oak and sweetness awsome palate round with a mix of tropical tree notes with apricot delicious finish perfectly ending this nice blend show  a brilliant blend of malts from the people who undisputedly for generations have crafted excellent whiskies unique in taste rich in flavour a pleasing all round palate great balance of peat sweetness oakiness and an exceptional finish a favourite and highly recommended whisky  my favourite johnnie 
1743.0, hmm nice i d have this again soft smooth and pleasant i asked for a not sweet clean tasting whisky and got this and it 39 s exactly that it 39 s quite low key but gets better as you drink it  it is in no way a bad scotch it is quite pleasing however it is underwhelming and not enough richness to stand out on the shelf or even be memorable it tastes a little bit like a middle of the road glenlivet 12 or glenfiddich 12 which is fine but it doesnt pop  this distillery and its associated flagship malt is getting a lot of traction due to a certain famous whisky youtuber selecting it as his 39 whisky of the year 2021 39 deservedly so in my opinion as there is a lot to like about arran and this bottle of 10 year old single malt great presentation in its re styled livery boldly proclaiming its natural colour and non chill filtered composition the nose is delightful all vanilla biscuit and warmth the taste is fairly unique along with the above you got this pronounced tropical coconut taste which might not appeal to everyone but its firmly there the finish adds a bit of ginger and spice from the oak whilst this is an 39 island 39 malt there is no peat used here and there is very little saline feel which characterises other island whiskies you have here a more hybrid highland spice oak vanilla lowland tropical fruit coconut style all in all you are getting a bargain at under 163 40 a real solid choice for your whisky cabinet i for one would like to see this in more pubs and bars instead of the usual suspects  possibly one of my favourite drams to date  this is a tasty scotch with a strong toasted burnt caramel nose and taste with just a hint of smoke it 39 s a little rough in the mouth if you let it sit too long  after my first sips i immediately stocked up this might replace glendronach 12 as my almost daily dram especially given glendronach 39 s dull chill filtered future non chill filtered natural color no playing around with all sorts of casks how refreshing you can taste the quality vanilla sweet still a bite and some distillery character for 30 euros a no brainer  an excellent bottle as recommended by ralfy the nose is just bursting with sweet apple and yes coconut this is the first tine i smelled coconut in whisky and i love it the palate is sweet with a small burst of sweet jasmine rose tea flavor very interesting finish is spicy with a bit of oak as would be expected with only 10 years of maturation overall a very good malt even if you are experienced definitely better than a lot that i tasted such as dalmore 12 auchentoshan 12 3 wood etc that are more mainstream can t wait to open my arran bothy batch 4 cask strength  a christmas gift from a supplier i wasn 39 t expecting much from this to be honest very pleasantly surprised even more so that it 39 s only 163 34 very smooth with great flavours and a slightly orangey aftertaste  big thumbs up to arran on this 1 look at what you 39 re getting here 46 non chill filtered natural colour and annage statement it 39 s well made tasty whisky only 33 quid too buy 1 it 39 s a no brainer we received the arran 10year old whiskey as a present from a colleague neither me or my wife drank much whiskey however we ve been introduced to a real life pleasure i can t discuss aroma oaky ness or running through hop fields with any education but i can tell you it s a beautifully smooth drink that we will purchase ourselves again and again  a nice consistent and reliable whisky at a fair price although my last bottle not from here did seem a little different i 39 ve not bought another one since to confirm if it was just a one off issue or perhaps a storage problem the best bottle was the one i bought in arran itself i 39 ve never bought it from here but it 39 s on the list  i didn 39 t know anything about the arran distillery when i saw this in my local bottle shop i mainly bought it because i used to go to arran on holiday as a kid but it turns out the whiskey is actually pretty awesome it has a more of an alcohol smell and a kick than the other scotches i 39 ve tried but it 39 s great with a little ice or water bonus points for the packaging as well some of arran 39 s newer packaging looks a bit tacky for my taste but i think the natural colour packaging and satisfyingly sturdy bottle you get with the 10 year old are spot on  a triumph have had several bottlings since the mid 2000 39 s and it has never failed better than the 14 yo and 18 yo in my opinion a modern classic  after a recent ralfy review this tipped me over the edge of a few times putting it in my basket and taking it out i started out on speysides i 39 ve turned to highlands but my love is islay 39 s thing is as much as i love peat it 39 s a subtle build up this dram is really nice i find it similar to dalwhinne but without the slight peat a simple whisky that oozes quality at a fair price won 39 t be the last bottle i buy of arran 10 having enjoyed the arran bodega cask and spotting a ralfy review on this one i thought id give it a spin and am not disappointed there 39 s a lot in there to explore and i found just a little bit of spring water helps expanding it even more this won 39 t be the only bottle i buy and the price is quite fair which makes a change for a quality 10yo scotch these days  easy to drink sweet but with a little bite nice coastal influence lovely flavours hard to dislike at this price and better tasting than arran 14 yo for me this could be my new everyday whisky personally i like the new branding the bottle feels nice in the hand too  this is a nice dram and a very affordable one too arran spirit is great and although only 10 yrs old this is still pretty smooth with a fair bit of complexity a staple for a lighter dram to sherried versions for vfm and quality combined its 4 5 for me struth for the price it s a delicious dram and a real bargain this is a great daily drink and much friendlier than the 50 abv amorone sauterne port cask expressions an easy decision  lovely dram 46 ucf natural colour 10yrs old 163 34  a beautiful whiskey i do like a speyside but was referred to the arran to try top mark 39 s as its a lovely easy drinking spirit  nothing special very fresh and has no unpleasant tastes very clean with some coastal feeling one of the best in the price range  probably my favourite sub 163 70 dram going better in my opinion than arran 39 s 14 and 18 year old expressions it 39 s their signature whisky for a reason because it 39 s bloody brilliant however the recent rebranding has definitely left me a little dispirited pardon the pun with the the arran malt there was just no need for it and it is visually a huge step backwards for me shame  interesting dram this quite fresh and summery with a heathery feel smooth on palate and a nice bit of fruit a bith of burn even with water on the finish but still holds its own probably could do with a little longer in barrel but very nice going to enjoy this bottle gb usually take my whisky straight tried this one with a drop of water as advised in a review excellent advice  well this whisky took me right back initially the nose a proper old fashioned type of dram it reminded me of imperial which i haven 39 t been able to afford for many a year the merest hint of water opens it out and as my wife said 39 this is quite complex 39 she takes it neat i 39 m not sophisticated enough to go into raptures of what flavours are similar to it to me it is a whisky that echoes a bygone era it is how whisky used to be a time traveller 39 s dram  a great whisky at a great price  very interesting and complex for 10 yr old and price range tasty citrus vanilla nutty cinnamon wasn t too keen on 14yr old but i like this natural non chill filtered 46 dram yummy  there are better whisky 39 s out there of course but i can 39 t think of a better one for the money a superb 39 standard 39 expression from a distillery that produces outstandingly good stuff it 39 s the kind of whisky you want to keep a secret because the price will inevitably start going up gt pause lt please forget you read this move along nothing to see here  it s gentle yet very specific and unique has a similar after taste feeling of pleasure in a throat to the 12yo whiskeys finished in a cherry cask totally worth a try  a first class smooth malt whisky easy to drink and a lovely after glow  i had never heard of arran malt until the early 21st century when we visited the distillery and purchased the 6 year old version the only vintage available at the time i have been an addict for malt whiskies since i first tasted the macallen in ardeer but as i have grown older i find the softer taste of arran malt much more to my taste it is to me a soft comfortable whisky now at 80 i still find it most enjoyable and have converted my children even though it has meant each bottle not lasting as long  the arran 10 is matured in a mix of bourbon casks and a small portion of refill sherry casks with the bourbon influence being dominant both in taste and color pineapple coconut vanilla a creamy nuttiness and citrus with a slight whiff of coastal heathery influence that pays tribute to its island roots arran 10 is a beautiful entry dram and offers a respectable quality for a fair price the previous quot look under the surface quot review is correct and this gentleman explains it very well that there are beginners malts and there are these such as arran 10 which are not overly complex but offer a bit more as an entry dram to seasoned scotch connoisseurs then your run off the mill 10 to 12 year old that are chill filtered thin and watered down to 40 abv would this is not glenfiddich 12 apple juice the arran 10 is a robust whisky and even slightly challenges you when you spend time with it there are not many other scotch that pack so much good flavor in only 30 40 bottled at 46 non chillfiltered and non colored arran did not cut any corners with the arran 10 and stays true to traditional craftsmanship which is impressive for such a young distillery a minimum of 43 and non chill filtered keeps the body flavors and aromas in tact much better not bothering to artificially color your product for sly marketing purposes but presenting an honest and pure distillery character and product as close to what comes out of the casks as possible shows you care about the substance and traditions not superficial marketing this is one of my favorite summer and session drams to start a tasting with or for a slightly uncomplicated fresh but rich and rounded sip arran shows that a young distillery established only in 1995 can give ancient giants a run for their money  isn 39 t it curious how all these reviewers who say how malt x is not so good and malt y is so much better if you look closer they only care about smoothness well if you want smooth try jameson or crown or dewar 39 s some people even say that comics are an easier read than crime and punishment dthere are beginner 39 s malts and then there are others that 39 s not to say that quot others quot are always better they are just more quot difficult quot less accessible and take a bit more experience to enjoy and i don 39 t mean that in a condescending way 3 years ago i would probably hate arran i love it now it 39 s like a person who doesn 39 t have the most agreeable personality yet once you get to know them you find they have a lot to offer an interesting person vs someone who is polite and easy going yet that 39 s about all you know mark twain vs ned flanders or something like that i still enjoy glenlivet and other similar mainstays but i derive a lot more interest and engagement from malts like arran 10 no it 39 s not my favorite i rarely think in terms of quot malt a is better than malt b quot instead i contrast their differences and pick a dram based on mood weather occasion company etc i have yet to find a bad single malt  i backed into this bottle since i loved their amarone cask finish offering i wanted to see what other expressions this distillery had to offer i find it to be a subtle but very tasty dram with a nice proof point at 92 at 10 years old i knew it was on the young side but for the price i find this to be enjoyable when i 39 m exploring malts beyond the sherry and the smoke  light fruity flavors sweet and a little thin tastes younger than 10 years very light gold color lacks depth or complexity but is a nice warm summer night dram rather than a beefy winter warmer had this when the first came out ten years ago and was given a litre bottle for christmas 2017 it was every bit as good as it was the first time great flavour neat and even better with a drop of spring water a bargain  i thought the reviews were accurate a little harsh to start once 1 cube melted it was smoother the big thing for me was the flavor profile was very thin no depth initial nose a little sharp in keeping with 46 strength first taste good but slightly harsh added about a teaspoon of water in a big double and it was transformed on the way to sweet but not at all cloying rich and round in the mouth and it kept improving yes  rich deep pears complex fruitiness malty toffee sherry wonderful dusty barrels 80 20 bourbon sherry i believe splash of water 25mins it 39 s chocolate heaven auntie mo one of the finest drams out there and that 39 s some price respect  the best whisky ever tasted bought on tour of distillery  bought a bottle after a distillery tour and tasting tried most of the range and really enjoyed light and herby on nosing with a green apple flavour i have ordered more  for the price and the nose favour which hits you with green apples and other sharp fruit it 39 s well worth it lovely  when i read these comments about arran 10 yo together with the fact that its unchillfiltered natural colour and 46 abv there was no thought in my mind that this whisky could be bad to be honest it 39 s not all bad but defenitly not good as well in my opinion it is pretty sharp in the palate and has not much not to day no depth i am really disappointed and worked my way through the bottle by using it for irish coffee which i never did with any whisky before no more arran stuff for me until a future tasting convinces me of the good taste of other bottlings of arran  had to order this one special from my local shop here in cali and it was worth the wait smells like straight caramel apples and tastes like honey flowers sweet oak vanilla caramel green apples and pears and just a hint of sea air this is gorgeous stuff really light and not smoky at all but a really pleasant dram nonetheless plus its 46 natural color and non chill filtered need i say more if i want something smoky i have all kinds of islay 39 s and other peated single malt whisky to choose from who needs johnnie walker anyways i 39 ll take an arran which is an independant distillery and is not in jw the sugarbear arran 10 is a sweet dominant component of johnnie walker black minus the smoke it 39 s really really good but i miss the smoke peat and johnnie black is 20 cheaper  this is a new single malt for me and it tastes great to me it has a fine sherry taste the only problem i see is that i can 39 t get it at my local pa state store  the arran 10 held its own and i thought complemented the ancnoc 12 i like to taste scotches side by side as i am new to this it helps me discern the differences in the regions and in the different flavor profiles i found the arran to be slightly sweet you can pick up the honey flavour but the best part was a little bit of bitterness on the back end taste like green apples i enjoyed the complexity of this scotch i wouldn 39 t necessarily recommend it for beginners or for people that don 39 t appreciate the subtle changes in taste but it would be a nice find for others to try great value i agree with last speaker but i don 39 t enjoy it as much as anon seems to do in fact this is not what i 39 m looking for at all the taste is boooring  from a neat pour there 39 s not too much on the nose some tart green apples green grass salt and a fresh baked yeast roll with butter and honey the palate is sweet and oily with a continuation of the green apple notes the finish is quick and somewhat dry however i found it quite enjoyable overall at first the aftertaste is somewhat 39 sterile 39 and tart but that quickly goes away with continued enjoyment wonderful little dram  this malt is impressive in its relative complexity for its age the nose is busy spicy honey green apples slight cinnamon taste wise a bit more simple than the nose butterscotch apples the barley comes through with an explicit mention of age no color added no chill filtration 46 abv a true craft whisky  first off this is of exeptional value wait and see aran malt jump in price once they get more established fruity nose kinda reminds me of a glenlivet but less generic this is a 10 year old so dont expect great complexity but this one is rather vibrant for a 10 year old gotta love the fact that there are no artificial colors and that it is un chillfiltered thus is where all scotch companys should invest in support the small giys not the mega distilleries these guys are doing it the right way  am not a big fan of isle whiskeys gave arran a chance and was pleasantly supprized not to smokey but does leave a taste very nice no match to the stronger peaty whiskeys like ardbeg and the likes but a nice soft drop  i find to to be quite spicy in a way although in a good way spicy a kick in the mouth and lingering sweet taste after you swallow it definitely has that malt taste and quite an enjoyable smell not really an expert but i enjoy this whisky  its really good i totally recommend it i m no expert but i do enjoy whisky and in that field i can say this is a very nice whisky for the price  my favorite whiskey so far i prefer to drink it with quot lots quot of water the taste is then mild and round  the best 10 year whisky in my opinion light nose but great taste a quot must taste quot  like this a lot light color nose does not tell all vanilla dry light honest whisky from a beutiful island will always come back to this 10 year old well done arran  could sense that this could be good with a few more years in the cask as the whisky was well balanced but a little rough around the edges and a little on the spirity side perhaps the 12 or 14 year old might be more to my liking i like this whiskey a lot delicate and aromatic i can see why another reviewer gave it low marks and said it doesn t have much to it because it is very soft and light i love it for contrast it is a whiskey i will start an evening with a long time before i hit the peated islay malts  i love this whisky very aromatic with lots of grape on the nose the flavour is rich and malty with fruit and licorice a bit sharp perhaps but excellent overall   fin kannattaa kokeilla  sorry forgot to rate it sweet character full character with what i can only say is an ultra dry finish definately a love it or hate it thing i like variety and this one is interestingly different yet not overly so think dry glengoyne or aberlour  it might be to some people s taste but it s not for me it doesn t have much to it but doesn t seem to cope with the alcohol very well in a sort of mouthwash type way there are better malts out there for the same money
2619.0, ncf so 1 tsp room temp water for a double  what is the best way to prepare drink it lovely dram quite sweet but with a nice lingering caramel taste get this whilst you can all future bottles will be aged 12 years the 10yo will be no more  a wonderful unpeated dram  i am only just realizing how unique this whisky is and i 39 m nearly at the bottom it is in one word fresh and light and a nice change from the normal it is an unpeated ledaig 10 as macallan gold is the unpeated springbank 15 slainthe  i have been marinading myself in sherry monsters for the past year and a half whether because all the best casks have been used up or because my taste buds are saturated i can 39 t say but they seem to be becoming a bit samey too many quot no age statement quot i e young whiskies on the market now long story short i decided to broaden out a bit more not the waistline though and this was taking up space on the shelf with about a dram and a half in the bottom wow light fruity airy sweet ginger i am smitten all over again now i 39 ve bought another bottle so i still don 39 t have space damn guess i 39 ll have to drink it then  i first tried this amazing single malt along with its peaty sister ledaig on the ferry trip from craignure on the isle of mull to oban and i knew i would need a bottle when i got back home wasn 39 t easy to find but now that i have it very happy i do this is an incredibly unique single malt only thing i can think of that tastes like this is loch lomond original in that it has the same buttery note but this is more herbal and coastal with a similar hint of peat as well incredibly complex for 10 years this really take me back to mull an incredibly remote and beautiful place only wish i could have visited this distillery cheers the sugarbear tasty smokey spicy haggis in a glass strong drink great value for money if you do not like booze best give it a miss  love this just slightly different from other islays but up there and if you hunt around a bottle can be found for 163 30 which is an absolute steal would recommend to anyone one of my favourites from a small lovely distillery i like it simple as that  not a bad dram however i feel that if you are looking for a smokier but yet fruity whiskey i would go for a cardhu 12 which is about the same price and has more flavour i find tobermory a bit too spicy and oaky which is not my preference however some people may find it enjoyable  fruity light floral with light highland under tones of complexity not much sweetness but a little a bit of white pepper on the tip of the tongue good stuff  presentation is nice taste isn 39 t bad but the after taste wasn 39 t so pleasant  i live in arizona and picked up a bottle of tobermory recently and have been pleasantly surprised had no idea what to expect but it 39 s a very tasty scotch at a good price  buon profumo molto gradevole al palato e persistente nel suo gusto shenanigans i don 39 t see that anyone has left a bad review for tobermory 10 on this thread athough everyone is entitled to their opinion both good and bad i 39 m not going to rave about how this is the best whisky on earth but i will give it an honest objective review it took a few minutes but this dram eventually opened nicely from a neat pour at first there was the salted butter red apple skins and other sweet notes on the nose but after a few minutes the sugary sweetness opened into a delightful hint of birthday cake very cool the palate is soft but a strong peppered finish quickly follows leaving a slightly grassy aftertaste hints of oak and smoke are there but hide quietly in the background overall sweet fresh and green but dry and slightly harsh in the end  has become my favourite scotch it has a great taste in and down the throat i am hooked others just don 39 t compare  my grandson drives in the mull rally and brings me a bottle of tobermory each time last time it was your 15 this time it is a 10 not as good but also the 70cc bottle of 10 seems smaller than the 15 how come  nice touch of peat with a good character pleasant aftertaste i still prefer laphroaig or bowmore but i would say that this drink certainly holds its own slainte  a superlative malt but vatted surely i rather thought it was barrelled in islay and bottled in glasgow  i ve been buying laphroaig 18yo and ardbeg uigeadail recently but this much cheaper dram is just as enjoyable very pleasant and full of character though i still just prefer talisker distiller s edition  introduced to tobermory in tombstone az and found it to be as smooth as the air there is dry with a nice finish a very good finish i m sold  someone said it lacked the charachter of the islay malts and being it is the only distillary on the isle of mull id disagree and say it has its own fantastic charachter brilliant single malt always loved this whiskey got to be my number one for winter great flavour with a few drops of water added really warms you up seen alot of people saying it was sweet i didnt get that myself i m by no means an expert but i am scottish and have had my share of whiskeys this is great value for money  a very good whiskey indeed lovely sweet slightly smokey aftertaste and flavoursome tones with an understated pale finish it is smooth on the palate and has a beautiful lingering taste a real gem a fine whiskey and an excellent choice thanks j im i call shenanigans on all the bad reviews for both deanston and tobermory 10 i am a restauranteur bar owner and have stocked both over the course of many years after doing multiple blind tastings i am a fan of well balanced subtle complex slightly sweet non bitter and easy drinking smooth liquors i am not a fan of harsh alcohol tasting burn overly strong flavors heavily intense flavors i can understand why those who prefer a stronger bolder profile might not enjoy tobermory or deanston as much a i do but in no way can i understand some of the quot worst i ve ever had quot type criticisms from anyone unless they are drinking from a damaged abused or counterfeit bottle or the bad reviews might be from those with other motives i urge all to try for themselves taste blind if possible among a selection of good offerings and make up one s own mind deanston 12 and tobermory 10 are among my favorite scotch whiskys at any price and are truly great values with price considered ledaig also gets a nod from me as well  definately not the smoothest 10 yr out there strong start light peat finish little boozey for my taste  has a good taste and for price point is good value lighter than some of the island malts and a good introduction good way to start your island journey overall a decent drop and more complex than most at this price point move to the 15 for better flavour and depth but also deeper pockets needed  never had the old one so cannot compare it not my first island foray but definitely different flavours were not over complex good for a new island sampler like me quite floral on the nose and almost grass like taste is short but peppery like talisker though with more smoke like jura islay malts a quite unique blend finish is pleasant and sea salty almost akin to oban all in all a very nice and surprisingly complex malt at this price  very enjoyable and reasonably prized whisky definitely a recommended one  so the night started well laddie 16 onto port charlotte 10 then octomore 2 1 absolutely fantastic a couple of hours later we had a hankering for something else too so with clean palates we opened the tobermory and we were really impressed it doesn t have the punch or full character of the islay malts but very nice very clean and fresh will be getting through the bottle before long  such a smooth dram just got it for my 21st and i couldn t be happier the little hint of smoke is gorgeous  apologies my review above was of the old 40 10yo bottling  this whisky gets a bit of a bad press in the whisky community but it drinks well albeit with a weak finish but it s not overly sweet and has a light smoky and saline quality i like more interesting that speysides at the same pricepoint for sure  a hugely drinkable dram delicious flavour a slight touch of smoke with a marvellous well balanced taste a wonderful easy drink perfect for sipping in the evening or charging the hip flask  the 10year old 40 is much smoother  to whisky what a burgundy is to a bordeaux or any romantic to beethoven charming rather than grandiose i d give it to my mother in hopes she d serve it back to me  not bad whisky gently peated and smokier not very complex is a good entry level whisky for who wants taste the great peated islay and islands whisky  a very drinkable dram could have been a breakfast tipple for sure a bit underestimated fresh fellow 
41309.0, not terribly exciting but enjoyable sweet in flavour pretty easy to drink with a light burn at the end a fine everyday dram  this fantastic whisky needs 10 15 minutes out of the bottle with 2 3 drops of water to open up nose strawberry raspberry blueberry buttered toast butterscotch vanilla aged wood palate with water tropical fruit skittles coconut butter scotch vanilla finish a mild bitterness with vanilla white pepper and maple syrup for what this whisky is which is a 10 yr old priced 55 60 its 5 stars all day  while not mind blowing a very pleasant dram indeed and for the price and age hard to fault sweet nose with syrup sponge and custard or sometimes panettone sweet gentle palate sultana and pear wisps of ginger and coconut  great value for money don 39 t expect to be blown away it 39 s not an expensive whisky for its price range it stands out as a really good whisky very malty with a touch of pear and lemongrass on the nose on the palate it 39 s peppery malty with a touch of vanilla covered fudge the finish is warm and peppery a great bourbon oak matured whisky i for one can 39 t pick up any notes from the sherry casks  i bought a bottle just because it was reduced by 163 5 and you were entered into a competition to visit the benriach distillery single malts never disappoint but i wasn 39 t expecting anything particularly special but i 39 m so glad i got it as it 39 s positively one of the nicest whiskies ever to pass my lips especially unusual for me as i normally prefer peated scotch a really lovely sweet banana and barley flavour delivery was fast too i also received a complementary 30ml measure of the peated curiositas this was my first time ordering from mom and i will certainly be ordering from here again in the not too distant future good job chaps at master of malt  not the taste expected with lingering after bite when swallowed many of my guests appreciated other qualities so not bad for quot first run out of the gate quot 129303  best 10yr speyside i have ever had would choose this over many a 12yr scotch  bought only the sample but will soon buy the bottle i am really surprised with this whisky has a nice complexity and wood notes for such a young one loved how spicy and yet refreshing it is kind of a long sweet finish that is my least favorite thing and yet i recommend this as an awesome cost benefit purchase note 87 100 for me  smooth and drinkable just a bit light and underwhelming nothing wrong with it nothing captivating either the distilling is well done and the booze is round and soft but is apparent on the nose some dry citrus and apple but no darker fruit hint of caramel toffee apple some new oak herbs dry dill no smoke young and lively mixes well for a single malt  i was given a bottle of the 10yr old benraich single malt and with out knowing it 39 s history felt that it was a likened to a very smooth kentucky bourbon although i like the peat flavor of some scotch i would recommend this fine whiskey touched my palate all the right ingredients with beautiful flavor  wow i really love everything i have had from benriach and this is no exception this is just classic speyside raisins apples cinnamon oak even a hint of peaches all work in harmony amazing for a 10 year better than a lot of 12 years olds i have had from speyside excellent dessert dram cheers the sugarbear i thought i bought the smoky expression but hey what a suprise for this price this is a really good speyside  nose green apples cirtus very malt subtle caramel taste strong spice fresh herbs ginger soft lemon amp lime blam oilfinish medium soft spicei prefer the 10 year to the 16 amp the 20 year it has abit more kick and body www facebook com maltmondays my whisky blog very nice fruit cake and dried fruits lovely fresh citrus finish really decent drop for the price this one recommended with a few drops of water obviously  i loved the 12 and was sad to see it go it might be two years younger but this is even better than it 39 s predecessor it 39 s a touch more spritely than the 12 but it 39 s somehow richer at the same time time and time again this distillery keeps coming up trumps  a decent everyday whisky  enjoyed this well enough especially at 43 and non chillfiltered certainly there was plenty of fruit green apples and pears and some spiciness too maybe just a touch too much of the green apples for me though  excellent for the price as much as i like benriach i wasn 39 t expecting much at this price point but boy was i wrong at present this is my dram of 2015 so tasty and drinkable  got a taste of this yesterday at casc musa whisky mash excellent amp possibly even better than the old 12 which was highly drinkable the future looks very promising for this distillery 
1808.0, extremely smooth for a 15 year old a lot of sherry to the taste but not to the degree that it becomes a bad influence provided you like sherry cask not very complex but at the price it 39 s a great value joakim at 46 it needs a drop of water at the price it 39 s hard to beat this fine malt and i agree with all the positive reviews also try the glenfarclas 15 year old another gem  sherry sherry and more sherry theirs heap loads of it it is a monster and their is possibly no whisky in their the only tasting notes are sherry lemon and honey the latter two both possibly coming from the sherry nice drink as a whisky can taste the spirit  magnificent period  quite simply one of the best whiskies ever  spot on tasting notes by the chaps at master of malt 92 in canada for a 700ml bottle px finish is enjoyable px and oloroso finish in the benriach 12 is better happy to see that benriach adds no coloring and that it s non chill filtered 
9455.0, perfect neat only nothing back  a very nice relaxing enjoyable whiskey after a lovely desert  very smooth finnish delightful after taste a single malt that completes a evening and allows you to drift off into a diffrent world wonderful  perfection this could be the best whisky i have ever tried it shouldn 39 t be it doesn 39 t fit the description of the whiskies i tend to love none of that matters however it is phenomenally smooth and complex it 39 s just incredible it might sound silly to say but it feels like a bargain at that price i have paid more for much less  definitely the best whisky i have tasted i thought i was in heaven i wanted to pinch myself 128516 128516 128516  great whisky but to have at cask strength or a higher proof would have been epic the dilution to 40 was very unfortunate indeed i hope they consider a cask strength release as i will be eager to buy a bottle  this is as good as it gets best whiskey i 39 ve ever tasted perfection  certainly my favourite from what ive tried over the years dreadful easily the best irish whiskey best whiskey i ve ever tried i had this many moons ago at a friends wedding and enjoyed it very much i usually go to the black bush for sipping this was a real treat excellent whisky i ve had many 21 years redbreast jameson 18 blue label walker this is one of the tops in my opinion  one of the finer more subtle whiskeys have ever tasted  one of the finest whiskeys in the world thick smooth rich oily and delicious a phenomenal sipping whiskey and an absolutely outstanding example of the widely admired single pot still whiskey style oloroso and madiera casks add a very unique character no other distillery does this as far as i can tell and i hope they never change this i smelled the wet uncorked inside of an old 21y oloroso aging barrel at the distillery in 2016 and it was the best whiskey nose i have ever experienced very much worth searching for and get it while the vintages are good  tasted at the distillery the smoothest whiskey ever honey vanilla chocolate long long long expensive 163 159 so for value the 12 yr old distillers reserve 163 39 is a must  a remarkable whisky fruity spicy the vintage feel of 19years in sherry amp bourbon casks mixed with the 2 ur finish in madeira casks makes this a subtle but complex whisky elegant craftily made superb i am new for whiskey so far was more into gin i need to go no further have found my drink for the next decade thank you  the most smooth and flavorful whisky i have ever had  super smooth with notes of burnt honey and fruits feels like having honey directly from a honeycomb sumptuous gloriously rich multi layered complexity the very best as you 39 d imagine  excellent was lucky enough to happen upon two of these at a local shop for a low price of 99 us each neat no water needed was that melon was that honeydew yes yes it was  absolute perfection  best single irish malt whiskey for it 39 s age far superior to jameson single malt  i bought a bottle of this for 84 it hard to find in stores in the usa but i managed it only the second time if found it in 10 years anyway certainly the best whiskey i 39 ve ever tasted and having attended college right on the doorsteps of the distillery its all the more satisfying my tasting skills are not quite where i 39 d like them but there was no ethanol on the nose with some spice evident fruity on the palete and some very mild spice on the finish not a long a finish as i 39 d have liked but hot damn this is a great whiskey and at 84 i 39 ll be buying many more bottles  off the charts great better than almost all of the midleton 39 s in the sub 400 range and that 39 s saying something i am a dedicated scotch single malt drinker primarily the islay 39 s but bushmills 21 open up a new portal for me amazing  drink of the gods one of the finest whiskeys in the world very much worth a try the aging with oloroso and madiera casks gives a rich and complex flavor bushmills 21 is so good i had to go track down all of the types of spirits whose barrels are used to age it to see what makes it so tasty highly recommended  loved it smooth from start to finish tasted pancakes and syrup hints of vanilla with a spicy finish  i 39 ve been a bushmills drinker for years had my first taste of 21 after a gift bottle for christmas this whiskey even impressed my friend who is a scotch snob have tried other irish wiskey but once i tried bushmill 21 none compared hard to find in us  let 39 s face it bushmills is the whiskey for true irish men nothing coats the palate better than the 21 year blend nothing  expensive but definitely worth it smooth rich juicy lip smacking irish goodness  absolutely beautiful taste soft and mellow with a hint of spice and honey the set to this quality is redbreast 12 and bushmills 16  just a stunner it caught me off guard it is so good i have backed up 2 un opened bottles in my liquor cabinet just in case it gets a cult following which it qualifies for i drink it neat from a bourbon glass and allow it to sit for say 5 minutes before my first sip it 39 s just difficult to find any fault with this whiskey on the nose it s beguiling on the palate it 39 s haunting on the finish it just keeps coming back to your palate and senses and tell you that i am not done with you yet kudos to bushmills for this one  absolute nectar smoothest irish whiskey i have tasted  awesome that you offer this  serial 26754 2014 39 worth every last penny so dang good i could go on with a bunch of clever words about smokey this and hints of that blah blah blah but really can 39 t imagine someone being disappointed with this selection unless your a total whisky snob out of touch with us commoners also i know their in different classes but as a comparison beats johnnie walker blue at less than half the price and i only use this comparison because johnnie blue is supposed to be sort of a water high mark for quality really just good marketing like one of the previous posters said wish it wasn 39 t so good its hard to stay away from the store i purchased from had only one other bottle of this on the shelf i 39 ll be heading back to get that one soon  well it is new years eve and came across this at the store here in sterling heights michigan i look forward letting the genie out of the bottle later as 2016 arrives only left a comment before tasting it just to say paid 104 00 but worth it  a true drop o 39 the pure smooth as silk stockings on lady 39 s leg dilute only with pure water to open the whiskey but at two hundred quid a bottle including duty and shipping drinks are far and few between  it costs 76 eur in other shops  very good whiskey not quite as good as the 16 year old but very close morons calling it a scotch and buddy boy that has way too many flavor notes it 39 s a good irish for a priddy and now that diageo sold it it might get the respect it deserves  a delicate nose of nutty praline ginger toffee toasted almonds greek honey amp madeira cake mellow oak with a real juicy grapey wine note this just melts on the mouth with succulent sultana amp raisin mocha gingerbread red cherry bakewells and aromatic spices the finish is more juicy grape with notes of nutty sherry honey in greek yoghurt amp rum truffles a malt to melt into and the age has made this even more mellowed than your normal bushmills the whisky flaneur i am also a sottish whisky drinker but this has an amazing amount of complexity without the weight of a scotch very easy drinking definitely strong chocolate notes it 39 s only downside is that it is so easy drinking that i drink it too quickly  not scotch or a scottish whiskey dumba es stands alone if you add more than a few drops of water to this whiskey you should give it to someone who will appreciate it  just to note the flavor is definitely not islay smoke which i love more of a dank tarry nicotine taste there 39 s no fresh peat or anything like it smoke to be found  this is very very thick and quite good with lots of great mostly quot dark quot flavors chocolate maple dates pecans coffee etc awesomely thick and delicious except one of the more prominent flavors is a pretty thick pipe tobacco resin as mentioned in the mom review for me this just negates everything else if only that wasn 39 t there this might be my favorite of all time five stars easy but i just can 39 t get over it so three stars ymmv  not a shade on scottish whisky to be totally honest in norway you can get this for 163 57 at the vinmonopolet what a bargain  i purchased it for a roll licking 89 00 the taste is unique and its very smooth i am on my way to get one more of these  i almost have a hard time believing this has alcohol in it very smooth and very viscous if you ve ever tried booker s bourbon it s the same feeling just a different flavor goes down like a melted chocolate bar with some mocha nut dried fruit and yes but in a good way i think a bit of tobacco i don t get the mint or mango or grapes mentioned in the mom review really it s a brilliant totally unique whiskey that i d whole heartedly recommend to anyone and even perchance call the best whiskey i ve tried in terms of complexity however just as with booker s bourbon to my taste it s a bit too smooth not quite enough kick i ll certainly always keep one in stock for entertaining and cold nights though  completely awesome even a novice such as myself can appreciate the subtleties of history and flavor resonating throughout this fine spirit dr johnny j stephens as an avid irish whiskey fan bushmills 21 is off the charts the complexity is unbelievable the enjoyment of this whiskey separates the amateur from the purist  like others have said i was able to purchase this for less than 100 that being said this is as smooth as advertised it is a clean tasting irish whisky as is usual with these triple distilled and kiln dried nectars with lighter floral and sugar notes that last from start to finish a splash of water opens the nose and makes the taste from start to finish pure enjoyment i spent extra to buy this whisky because of its consistent great reviews and standing in 2014 s jim murray s whisky bible as the quot irish best single malt of the year quot it lived up to the hype   but it s 110 retail  full marks from me love this can t beat it but its not 225 its around 110 in most places i ve seen  great dram but as been said above it s cheaper than advertised here i can get it for 95 99 at my local package store at that price it s the best irish and definitely one of the best whiskeys on the planet period  best single malt irish period  as far as whisky goes this one is an absolute delight  this is one of my favorite whiskeys and indeed one of the first 2 bottles i bought on my 21st birthday it s rather like candy on the tongue that being said have you chaps lost your minds this is a bottle that can be had for less than half that here in reputable bottle shops here in lower manhattan where everything is absurdly expensive 
2098.0, with heavy heart i have to agree with the previous posters this is not the same quality dram that it was a few years ago and to add insult to the injury the price jumped by a third last year so you 39 re paying substantially more for a lesser product that 39 s just not right there are better alternatives for better value out there  the current 21yo offering is a pale shadow of the 21yo of 5 years ago unfortunately literally not worth 163 128 compared to other sherry bombs way cheaper dreadful stuff the old bottlings were beautiful this is not it is dreadful all new wood dry and thin none of the richness and flavour of the previous bottlings buy it and be disappointed i 39 m warning you  it makes a good entry in the noise but lacks the finish very smooth in tasting but perhaps too smooth it s good but would have been great if the price tag was about one third lower  fabulously rich flavor flat finish when i first opened this i poured three drams one i sipped immediately the next i added a couple drops of water to and let sit 15 minutes and did the same with the last one and let it sit over 30 minutes while the flavors emerged and there was rich sherry on the palate the finish fell flat every time fairly disappointing  it was enjoyable but not worth the money sherrybomb and great mouthfeel there was something really good in there it tasted like there was some really good old casks in there and a few not so good casks some flavours had difficult presenting themselves too much going on something was off balance i think this one would be a lot better at higher strenght and with more care when creating blending the batch i felt ripped of with the 43 aswell greedy  this is a lovely whisky no doubt but i 39 m still haunted by that traumatic episode in my life when the price jumped by 163 30 overnight it also feels less punchy less substantive now then it did a few years ago is it still value for money arguably not are there better 21 year old sherried drams out there at this price possibly  a very good dram by any stretch of the imagination what didn 39 t quite work for me and not that it has to is that i felt that the spirit was lacking depth of flavor sure the strength was fine and the aroma was magnificent i think it comes down to the quality of the barley there was a distinct lack of quot maltiness quot that should be the defining character of this distillate i understand that agriculture changes and hence so do the by products but increase it to 46 un chill filtered please and then we can have another beast altogether to appraise  i was expecting a lot but unfortunately didn 39 t find it a bit too subtle for my liking pleasant and would definately enjoy again but if you 39 re looking for rich sherried i think i 39 ve been spoilt by glendronach 18 year old allardice now i 39 ve tried it everything else comes up short against to the allardice  i feel harsh giving this 2 5 stars only because i 39 m aware that it might not suit my palate so hard to tell whether it 39 s genuinely bad or i just don 39 t like it tried so hard to like it every time i poured another glass but every time i was dissapointed and left wanting more balvenie 17 is a far better whisky for a lot less money but i guess it depends what you like this is a very rich whisky which i usually like it has a strong vibe of christmas pudding and marzipan which i don 39 t like it also has a strong alcoholic nose and taste if this sounds like your thing then go for it you might just love it definitely not a boring whisky personally i 39 d go for oban 14 or balvenie 12 or 17 every time  too good for me i bought this on the basis of all the great reviews i 39 ve got to say it was different than i was expecting although i just think my palate isn 39 t advanced enough to detect all of the flavours it is quite strong out of the bottle add a drop of water and it brings out the flavours better very rich and chocolatey think of rich xmas cake and winter spices i wouldn 39 t buy again at the price of 163 150 but there is no doubt it 39 s one hell of a whiskey  to iterate i get barbecued fruits and vegetables in this pineapple figs bell peppers paprika powder spice garlic would you believe it very fruity and very floral dry cocoa powder potpourri yes hot apple cider yes ha lavish elegance  glengoyne 21 is the finest malt whisky i have ever tasted my sister gave me a bottle for christmas and i have just finished it a wee dram once in a while when i fancied it i shall buy another bottle for special occasions  interesting  this has to be one of the best smelling whiskys i ve ever had i spend as much time nosing the glass as i do sipping its contents outstanding whisky  cola molassis and dark fruits nearing the end of the bottle now and for sure i 39 ll miss it but will i go out and buy it again no because while it is interesting the notes are too subtle too quiet  stupidly good  i like it not my favourite 21 year old but it 39 s good  one of my favourite staples please notice that the newer glengoyne 21 is not matured in first fill sherry casks  just opened a bottle yesterday absolutely fabulous  great god it 39 s good noses of sherry and fig rich syrup transitioning to long cinnamon finish reminds me a lot of glendronach  great mouth feel punches above its weight similar to a 25 yr old whisky mouth feel is almost equal to chivas regal 25yr old maple syrup on the nose and would score higher except it leave s a espresso black coffee taste in your mouth next day  is just great it 39 s a fine highland malt toffee caramel smooth flavours are evident in this good 21yr whisky however coming from a regular islay malt drinker it holds its own well with the standard 10yr editions but fades alongside octomore 15yr darkest or 18yr bowmore 39 s uigeadail bunnahabhain 18yr and dark cove  simply delicious all the flavours work in perfect harmony with each other creamy and lovely mouthful if you liked the 18 yr old you 39 ll love this best 21 yr old out there 128526  a tough competition for any current 25yo in the market  the 1st fill sherry cask really does make this 21yo very special i had this on my 21st birthday and it was fantastic dchocolate the xmas cake coffee roast if only this is presented at 46 or higher and unchill filtered  mainly on the strength of all the positive reviews i bought a bottle of the glengoyne 21 having drunk about a quarter of it i find myself trying and failing to like it as much as i had hoped to me the nose is a pleasing combination of sweet sherry and a very promising spiciness that invites you into the first sip but there is a hint of astringency and i find this sharp alchoholic overtone to the nose is the flavour that dominates in the mouth over 163 100 is a lot to pay for a bottle of whisky and i think the buyer is justified in having high expectations at this price point there 39 s a lot to like about this whisky but i don 39 t think it delivers for the money comparing it with others on my shelf such as the delightfully smooth old poultney 21 for just under 163 100 and the gorgeous talisker 18 a smokier dram but with plenty of sherry and all for under 163 80 i 39 m afraid this one doesn 39 t make the grade on taste alone i 39 d give it three stars but i bumped it down to two for poor value for money  this whiskey is great and at a reasonable price but if you can afford it buy the 25 which in my opinion is 2nd only to macallan 25 which costs significantly more the 25 will in time go down as a great so snap it now before the prices goes up and up but as a every week treat the 21 year old as a pleasure to drink enjoy right now you can buy this at 125 00 usd in a lot of places and its 750ml this is better than the macallan 18 hands down i 39 ve got a meager collection of 32 bottles and this is by far the best whisky i 39 ve had to date i d recommend this as a gift i would recommend this to first time whisky drinkers i 39 d recommend this as something to stock up on what more could anyone possibly say at this time rating 94 100 this is one those elitistwhiskydrinkers on the nose you can expect the sourness of the red berries mixed with a hint of liquorice oak and a whole shelf of mixed dried fruits the palate is a mirror of the nose sweet rich thick and complex balance between all the notes above the finish is eternal and keep changing through the minutes maple syrup dried cranberries and dies on a note of warm christmas mince pie this scotch is elegant and well crafted with what it can offer there 39 s no point in bashing the chill filtration aspect of it if you see such bottle buy it it 39 s worth every damn pennies  for those who prefer the highland style of whisky you will find that this 21 yr old scotch is one terrific bargain i bought this 21 because most other 21 39 s are much more expensive or more difficult to find i also bought the glendronach 21 at the same time most of us are aware that everybody 39 s palate is different but nevertheless there are standards to go by and measure against the glengoyne 21 is a star no matter how you measure it it easily compares with other much more expensive brands the best i have ever tasted is a macallan 25 but this whisky satisfies most of us mortals the smooth yet intensely flavorful quality is beyond what most 21 39 s offer it is a serious well balanced slightly fruity whisky that can stand up to some 25 39 s it is quickly becoming my go to drink alongside the glenmorangie signet the glendronach 21 pales by comparison unless you prefer a smooth slightly sweet dram i like my chosen drink to have some soul and backbone like this one there are some who underwhelm and underdeliver this one over delivers  good but i like the 18 better  the first sip went into my mouth was completely heaven nothing further to ask for on such full sherry cask highland single malt whiskey no need to think further just grab one bottle please  i 39 ve tried several different malts from the glengoyne distillery amp decided to treat myself to the 21 year old for christmas wow i really don 39 t know what else to say beautifully smooth highly flavoured amp definitely one bottle that i would highly recommend anyone who really appreciates good whisky invest in you won 39 t be disappointed  the glengoyne 18 being our whisky club 39 s whisky of the year we splashed out on a 21 for xmas wonderful very smooth with depth to rival barry white 39 s bassitone with notes of just about everything quot possibly erring on the side of too much oak quot what 39 s wrong with you people  this is a smooth exceptional whisky and is a unique treat highly recommended  real good stuff for this money  smooth deep long and way too easy to drink a great alternative to a macallan 18 21 i 39 ll give it 96 100  the color is intense for being only 21 years and at natural color definitely has the hallmarks of a big sherry whisky with the dark fruits i will put this as a slight word of warning i am picking up very faint hints of sulphur in this release the whisky is very drinkable but for those sensitive to sulphured whiskies be a little cautious here  i ve just finished a bottle of this and i have to say that it is very close to the 25 year old it has the same intense depth and deep sherried flavour deep red fruits and spice the 25 year old is bigger better balanced and a more expansive taste the nose is fruitier but this is a very fine whisky i love glengoyne whiskies and the 25 is about the best i ve ever experienced but this 21 year old is firmly up there on the top shelf way above the 18 and 15 which are great but obviously much younger and less complex for the price the 21 is a bit of a bargain especially when you consider what other distilleries are charging for their nice but inferior malts sm tried a few new scotches last night first was the tomatin 12 then lismore 21 then this delightful dram while for the price i enjoyed the tomatin 32 it was a bit on the sweet side with the sherry being masked by an abundance of butterscotch and pear until i returned to it later the lismore was a complete letdown for my first 21 year lacking depth and complexity i so desired with more smokiness than i care for after letting the glengoyne breathe a bit my companion and i finally nosed it for about 15 minutes straight i had found what i craved a dram that invited my nose into the glass for deep breath after deep breath the barley notes come through very true attributed to their abandonment of peat and replacing it with dry warm air instead dark fruit plays in the nose changing from black cherry to plum to date with a hazelnut or walnut depending on the nosing to back it up nicely the sherry comes through with a perfect balance in my opinion not too strong but lets you know it s there after nosing quite some time the crystal was tilted back for the first taste many of the same characteristics as the nose the sherry touched my tongue lightly with a nice warmth but no burn with the fruits coming in on the finish that carried quite some time let this one sit it takes at least a minute for all the complexities of the finish to hit your palate with the dark fruits and slight nutty roundness at this point it comes back up giving a new warmth with a ever so subtle dash of cinnamon and the cherry returns a bit this is the dreamy dram i ve been searching for and as glengoynes motto states it was quot worth the wait quot if you don t like heavy peaty islay malts but prefer a masterfully crafted dram where each step is meticulously and slowly completed longest distillation process of any scotch and they take 5 6 years prepping the casks this dram should call for you refined complex and deep i shall be returning to this new friends again and again cheers  the glengoyne 21y o is by far the best scotch whisky available today for the price it is complex and tasty there just aren t enough quot o s quot in smooth to describe a dram of this treat knowing the lads that make this whisky treasure all their love and talent comes through in giant terms who needs loads of smoke and peat give me true malt done well highland cognac it is  a real sherry monster one of the best whisky s i ve ever tasted right up my street true single malt lovers will agree that glengoyne 21 will always stand as the special sipping single malt of this century  pitted fruits and gingery spices marvelously married smooth yet complex  not to my taste matured in sherry for all of it s life that s rare and delicious i read a review saying that the 17 year old was better and that i should ignore the 21 year old having tasted it i can only say that that review was wrong the 21 year old is too different to compare the 17 year old is smooth and easy to drink the 21 year old is a lot more warm and complex a bit too much oak and a bit dry but if you like that then it is perfect joakim  17y is good but this one is worth the extra money wonderful 
42272.0, spicy stone fruits honey slightly peary but not overpowering a truly delicious dram that will only get smoother with time  beautiful citrus and floral nose with a fantastic complex honeyed flavour that develops the longer you hold the whisky on the tongue long and satisfying finish with a pleasant taste of oak that sticks around for hours  a gooey everlasting slightly underbaked in the best possible way orange shortbread of a whisky that 39 s also been gently kissed with black pepper and vanilla just lovely  this was a fantastic surprise as never tried any benromach before the smell and flavour is very rich with smoked plum and dried fruits aromas a nicely balanced sweetness and smokey notes so much happening in the nose and on tongue that i can put it even above the balvenie  far too oaky my wife asked for an un paled speyside malt and was given this had to tell her it was a great present but frankly compared to other 15 yr malts it s rubbish unless you like something very strong and more talsker like  i refuse to belive this is a 15 year old its such a complex whisky with so much going on and it takes a dram or two to know what is going on the nose is fanatic with green apples and much more going on but once you try it its a complete suprise that is different from the nose but the best bit is the finish that is long dry and just sticks with you that you cant help but keep drinking must try  fans of the style will enjoy this complex with spice fruits herbs and a touch of well integrated peat smoke the leather 39 funky 39 notes do sing loudly but that 39 s what makes this one really stand out great value  a bit leathery but overall very nice  love this sweet to spice to smoke wonderful  who ever wrote the tasting notes for the product page should go back to school ginger and mint no maybe muted and muddied sherry with a flat finish the balance is off on this whisky and the quot big spices quot and quot touch of smoke quot well ok if you mean canned fruit cake and cheap cigars i wanted to love this bottle i was super excited when it arrived but next to even the 12 year old from glendronach this pales in comparison  brilliant just brilliant a new favourite  tasted this while we were in scotland and while we have never been whisky drinkers we fell in love will never drink another nothing else tastes like this you will not be disappointed  so smooth and full of flavour you can contemplte the nuances for hours we have tasted many single malts but this is our favourite if you want your single malt smoooooth benromach 15 is the one 
38424.0, a friend brought some back from a cruise and i loved it  excellent meant to be drunk by two good friends  a real shame that their is no supply of this on this side of the pond had the pleasure of tasting this before the purchase and did not hesitate the grab a bottle while i 39 m not technically a whisky drinker this ticks most of the boxes to my taste  absolutely stunning enjoying a dram on christmas eve and couldn t have opened a better bottle in my cabinet velvet smooth the nose is astonishing with hints of vanilla dried fruit and a oakines i highly recommend you grab this on your travels it will not disappoint i like balvenie whisky some a little more than others the tripple cast is one of the best a big shame i can 39 t replace the bottle  normally i have to settle for the 12 year old double wood sold in the high street supermarkets i have had the 17 year old double wood which was very nice but hard to get hold of this was was given as a birthday present now i got the 16 year old triple wood from gatwick airport duty free this suits my tastes extremely well just wish it was on the high street instead and more readily available than an airport duty free  bought in aruba amazing sorry it isn 39 t sold anywhere but duty free best single malt scotch i 39 ve ever had balvenie is one of my favorite distilleries their regular 12 year double wood is better than this it s drinkable but i certainly wouldn t blow a duty free purchase on it btw i just bought the highest end macallan fury free only macallan and the 18 is 10 times better i ve had about 6 duty free only bottlings and all have disappointed nted i m now convinced that duty free is simply a way for them to hock inferior juice unless someone can tell me otherwise  i just love it absolutely smooth and the best scotch i 39 ve had  not my usual whisky but just tried my first glass and i think i ve made a life altering change slightly sweet extremely aromatic amazing product  i loved the 12 yr old then i tried the 16 and it was fabulous stunning love it very much a let down i ve savored the ship of the line 12 year the 14 c c the 21 and now the 16 has left me broken hearted where is the fruit overpowering oak and no finish sad  quite delicious  avoid balvenie 12 is tripple times better than this travel retail market crap delicate light and smooth and utterly characterless i d not buy it again unless it was under 20 quid actually i still wouldn t but you re welcome to gift it to me  creamy amp really smooth it will be my scotch of choice from now on  easy to drink and thats about it oakey with minimal honts of other flavors and short to medium finish  an excellent whisky with an explosion of sensation on the palate and yet a very smooth malt to drink certainly one that will feature in my whisky stock from now on  i 39 m enjoying the hint of honey and smooth taste on this night before christmas  by far my favorite of all the whisky 39 s i 39 ve tried can 39 t be beat for the price to taste in my opinion very smooth easy to sip and drink i actually prefer this to the 21yr balvenie portwood i would also recommend the glenlivet 15 year special cask strength at 43 a very nice dram as well  i bought my first bottle of the triple cask 16 this week i am a fan of the 15 yr single cask but this is sweet and fruity easy to sip without adding water great find  i don 39 t really understand the other ratings this is not a horrible whisky but there really is nothing to write home here the oak is overpowering there is little else and there is practically no finish also i don 39 t think that 40 alcohol is the ideal dilution i much prefer the other balvenies  i brought this bottle to an old friends gathering not expecting any outcome surprisingly smooth and easy to drink needless to say i grabbed another bottle the next time i see it  easy to drink always the same pleasant fruity and smooth i like  like fine cognac a very smooth and subtle scotch that is both easy sipping and complex in nature  very fruity smooth honey lovely stuff good job balvenie  if you have both options available go with the 12 year  very nice i like triple cask i simply wish to advise that i have thoroughly enjoyed this malt and despite liz 39 s protestations about there being lurry loads of whisky in the house i have had to pick up a second bottle 
2568.0, best whiskey i have tasted 10 out of 10 very easy on the palate does not ask many questions of the drinker some might find it bland i don t my absolute favourite go to single malt  nose mild burn maybe butterscotch palate crumbly mouthfeel airy cup cakes lightest fruits after spice and soft canned sweets close this out nice  i 39 ve seriously been looking for this whisky for about 5 years here in northern california and only since the game of thrones release of it same whisky different labeling have i finally got my hands on some on the nose reminds me a lot of jw gold i wonder why hint of peat smoke with hay grass honey vanilla and subtle baking spices palate is about the same but i love the mouthfeel slightly creamy with the feint smokiness weaving it 39 s way through to a dry grassy finish i wish the proof was higher but even at 80 proof an impressive array of flavors and a substantially long finish are here indeed definitely worth the wait this is an excellent example of highland whisky cheers the sugarbear also check out whisk e y dixon reviews on youtube if you want to see me in action  had my first taste of this fine malt at windsor bowling green lovely smooth taste couldn 39 t resist buying a couple of bottles  got a bottle as a christmas present it 39 s ok for the price point i wouldnt buy another and it wont be hammered through in short order like others might but it will be happily consumed can get better more distinctive malts at this price in my humble opinion but to each their own never understand people who compare malts to blended whiskies blends and in particular the likes of quot find a hill put one foot in front of the other quot not to advertise are designed to be very drinkable mass produced and sold to the masses that usually dont know any better there isn 39 t anything wrong with quot blends quot as a whole just the bad ones malts are more expressionate of the distillery the area they come from their recipe and the distiller this has done an ok job of that nothing fancy drinkable some people will like it probably most wont but you get bad malts too again just an opinion  can 39 t understand the 2 reviews below it 39 s an excellent dram at this price point  tasted better blended whiskies i love malts but this one does nothing for me  i tried bottle 2 in 1998 wasn 39 t the least bit impressed fell way short of my expectations that 39 s why i won 39 t be buying this anymore sorry for the disappointment  still very decent for it 39 s price this whisky suffers from a noticeable concentration of color additive in it 39 s taste if only lochnagar would omit it  delightful smooth sweet spicy a very well mannered whisky a dram to share with both experienced and inexperienced whisky drinkers alternatively because i really enjoy it i might just keep it all to myself  nose fruity citrus and a touch of peat sweet peppery and oak spice citrus and peat on the finish i guess it 39 s ok for the price but i 39 d rather go for a glencadam 10yo or a craigellachie 13yo do not agree with the high average user rating here  a great gold bunting of steel smooth clean good as any i 39 ve had better than most and the price is great  it is a smooth tipple the only malt i will drink i went to the distillery whilst in scotland had a tipple and bought a bottle i have just opened it after 6 months and it was worth waiting for it is well worth the money and could form a good everyday tipple at the price much better than some of the industrial scale production varieties at about the same price  i discovered royal lochnagar while working in aberdeen many years ago it has been my favorite single malt since  this is the cleanest least pretentious single malt i think i have tried no sherry casks no rum undertones no quot hints of jasmine on a midsummer 39 s morning quot just whisky done right i think some people won 39 t understand this dram and mistake it for something dull or badly made it is not a quot statement quot bottle nothing to show off to your friends it is an everyday dram far better than most people have in their drinks cabinet perhaps i am giving it more credence than it deserves perhaps i am missing something but if you enjoy whisky i think you 39 ll enjoy this one and i believe that by the end of the bottle you will respect what the distillers decided to do even if you do not buy another  if you have a chance to come across one of this bottles do not hesitate to get it i think this is probably one of the best whiskies for the price range very very smooth yet flavourfull perfect to offer if you want to hook up into whisky a non whisky drinker i have offered a glass of this to many people and so far everyone has agreed this is one of the most pleasants drinks out there  for the price arguably one of the best its outstanding  i first tasted royal lochnagar at the distillery on a tour of scotland in 1990 and loved it but have found it difficult to obtain in the states since then i have bought it whenever in the uk a smooth and delicious whisky and worth the effort  i love my whiskey  my favourite whisky  i visited the distillery during a recent tour of speyside i was hooked and bought a bottle needless to say it was totally consumed shortly after returning home i 39 ve since ordered several more bottles  the best i have ever had have visited the royal lochnagar distillery on many occasions one of the best i have tasted being a scot i do like my whiskey i prefer this one choice of taste has a hint of the european oak but a very smooth finish  this is my all time favourite malt makes me feel like a king when i drink it god bless scotland been away to someother bottles but always come back to rl def my favourite for just a quiet evening watching the football smooth nice and worth the money will buy again and again i find rl to be mildly sweet with an ease on the throat and oesophagus no burn just smooth descent after a lovely bouquet and a sweet appeal to the taste buds  i 39 ve drank many whiskeys recently and i 39 ve found this to be the best i 39 ve ever tasted including some several times the price  i have been drinking this for many years and find it such a good taste you can keep the rest i will buy the best have visited the distillery on several occasions well worth a visit if you are on holiday  i was in one of those fashionable places with a couple of hundred whiskies to choose from this one was recommended by another bloke looking bemused at the choice never spoke to him again but remembered the whisky  totally random choice for me but it certainly was very easy to drink tasted to me quite like glenmorangie did many years ago very smooth and slight sweetness but not to much nice evening treat especially with a little cold mineral water and a couple of ice cubes  color golden amber nose herbal with a touch of honey palate honey and heather medium weight licorice and raisins finish medium length lots of barley and a touch of vanilla on the finish a nice 12 y o malt i ve never seen this in the us so i bought a bottle on a recent trip to the uk i am happy that i did  i m new to the world of malt whisky but after reading the reviews on here i decided to give this one a go and wasn t disappointed sweet and very smooth it s a beautiful mouthful  never heard of it till few months back my brother in law gifted it to me opened it recently must say quite smooth medium body appreciated it will definitely buy a review of whiskies i d read from 2005 firstly pointed me in the direction of a whisky i didn t like the review also highlighted the lochnagar as a good un so when i tried the lochnagar i was a bit wary no need to be this is an excellent drink the reviewers got this spot on  i am usually an islay drinker but my wifes new boss brought a bottle over from aberdeen and i may have to change smoothest single malt i have ever had definetly a must try for anyone still looking for quot their quot label  i haven t found royal lochnagar in the states so i bought some and had it shipped to me smoothest first impression i have had in a scotch better than jw blue  one of my favourite scotch whisky everyone must have it in their home whisky bar but 30 pounds 1200 rubles price in the shops 2900 rubles what can i say more  first tasted on a trip to oban distillery and wondered how i d avoided it so long it has what i d describe as an old fashioned taste slightly sweet smoky with a medium flavour three friends all tried it at the newcastle whisky festival and they all liked it one has bought a botlle since 
34014.0, great whisky from tomatin easy drinking with plenty of character very nice whisky definitely recommended  yommy nose raisin nutty licorice anise subtle dark bitter chocolate palate mostly raisin citrus and orange hints creamy buttery it 39 s a decent purchase i 39 m personally not a big fan of the raisin but not a bad dram at all  one of the great 12 yr old bourbon cask whiskies imo it has everything you want at a good price top dram thisstruth probably the best whisky one can buy at this price great tipple fast becoming one of my favorites very smooth with a plethora of flavours the subtle orange citrus just hinting in the background long smooth finish hard to equal in the price range and a bargain when on offer a lovely smooth and pleasant drink i 39 m not sure where those who don 39 t like it are coming from e g use it for stripping paint clearly they should stay off the alcohol and away from anything so good as this  not bad but there are better whiskys out there in this price range i definatly picked up the raisin on the nose and the oak on the palette but for me not a huge amount more the finish was slightly peppery and a little bitter but had a nice warmth coming through  received as a gift from capt fabio i took a long look until my taste buds longed for the taste it 39 s was a stardust of flavors that i shared with my son who has just graduated from college a good memory was made  one of the best whiskies i 39 ve tried recently grabbed a bottle the other day when it was on offer and turned out to be an absolute gem very gentle and sweet whisky with lots of good characteristics the bottle is perfectly suited for gifting so bought one for my friend too  this was on offer the other day so grabbed a bottle some darker fruits plenty spice but controlled apples also followed i think a little orange good longish finish rather good for the money i do like tomatincask type matured in a combination of bourbon barrels and sherry casksstrength 43 alc vol recent award medalsdouble gold 2019 san francisco wsca splash of water brings out its bourbon cask character very nice indeed a quality finish struth excellent scotch for the price light bodied smooth toffee nutty apricot taste no harsh alcohol front or finish  i like it but it 39 s a young angry dram well maybe not angry maybe just aggravated i 39 ve looked at a lot of tasting notes on this stuff but the thing about this that i notice most is a caramel and almond or walnut finish and that stays with me well after the glass is empty but it is a bit sting y i can get speyburn for less abs i recommend speyburn over this at this price  it 39 s a good whisky but doesn 39 t overwhelm i was hoping that it would have more notes of the cask strength version which is just spectacular this version really tames down the buttery notes to an almost imperceptible level what i was surprised by were the fruit notes lots of green apple it is also much smoother with zero bite on the palate it does warm up once it goes down however the cask strength version attacks the nose and the palate but the fight is worth it the 12yo has good body not as thick and oily as the cask strength but definitely enough to contribute to the smoothness judging by the varying reviews there may be a quality control issue but the bottle i tried was one of the good ones definitely worth the 40 i paid  been awhile since i finished this bottle but i remember dried apricot and nougat  so bad i couldn 39 t finish it i didn 39 t wanna waste the 40 that i spent on it so i forced myself to drink half the bottle but worst alcohol i ever smelled and tasted  a beautiful single malt whisky with plenty of sweet and subtle notes top quality whisky and good on any occasion with or without ice  one very good single malt whisky very smooth and gentle and hints of sweetness all around gave it as a gift to my husband and he loves it my new favourite from a very good distillery tomatin 12 all the way  one of the best whiskies i have tried in a very long time it is smooth pleasant and very approachable no hints of turpentine or hand sanitiser for sure as the whisky is not over powering on flavours or on abv i recommend this whisky without water or ice as it is delicious as it is at 43 i managed to get my hands on their 12yo gift pack which cam with 2 lovely glasses highly recommended whisky from a top class distillery  i think it 39 s damned good inexpensive scotch i don 39 t know where the one star turpentine people come from probably from the same place i tried it on a whim and found it delightful almost as good as the balvenie 12 but i can buy 2 bottles of tomatin for what one bottle of balvenie costs i was recommended this bottle while asking for a fruity whisky having previously enjoyed black bush and glenfiddich 15 solera i figured wrongly that the sherry finish of this tomatin was going to win i taste too much alcohol to the point of it seeming chemical another reviewer said 39 anbesol 39 and i couldn 39 t agree more turpentine is present among the flavours one usually expects vanilla fruit nuts wood it does possess an oily character there is some caramel butter but overall the harsh alcohol ruins it for me like drinking hand sanitizer i expected more for 60 cdn and i feel lied to by the salesman he called it complex and i suppose it is but in the wrong ways shame really he sounded convincing with all those adjectives won 39 t buy this again you can be sure  decent low cost scotch definitely improves with a few drops of water and being allowed to breathe for a few minutes it mellows it out and allows dried fruit and ginger to come through the otherwise rather strong fresh cut wood flavors and you can pick up on the figgy elements of other highland scotches the finish is a little on the hot side and is grassy and malty this is definitely not as refined as other highlands on offer but since it s forty or fifty dollars cheaper than most of them you probably won t care  one of the most underrated speysider to be honest i don 39 t want to tell about it 39 s particular flavor and aroma profile because everyone can feel and taste different but what i can tell for sure is tomatin 12 has it 39 s very own character easy to drink fruity and perfect go to whisky for everyone good solid single malt and one of the best for your buck  i am not anywhere near well versed in high end single malts i run the gamut frominver house which is brilliant to dewars to curry sark and ballantine s high end blends like monkey shoulder and chivas and maybe johnny walker that said i occasionally select a low end single malt and i would certainly recommend tomatin 12 year old smooth fruitiness and no harsh alcohol backwash make this a superb selection  normally drink speysides but this is something else entirely dont even know what to compare it to really smooth on the palate with some fruity notes coming in the finish is amazing really creamy and long with a oily aftertaste in short youll either love it or hate it refreshing 12 year old head and shoulders above any 12 year old that i have tasted  loved this finished the bottle in no time really was my cup of tea would but this over many others  not complex i agree with the gentleman below in that i find the nose unremarkable easy dram to drink perhaps some fruity vanilla on the palate and a fairly easy going finish simple  i recently tried the glenfiddich 14 bourbon cask and i must say this is very similar super  smooth and well balanced overall there is a hint of something leather that 39 s a bit unusual both on the palate and in the finish but not off putting to me at all it compares well with other malt and malt blends in this price range finally though no one else seems to sense peat or smoke i do a wee bit it 39 s not bowmore 10 or anything for peat flavor but i taste it  interesting the nose is nothing special just smells like alcohol comes on strong with tanginess and fruitiness with ambesol in the background ends pretty icky and burny as far as budget scotches go this is alright i suggest spending an extra 20 on something better  this is my quot go to quot whisky for home use either if i have guests or just looking to end the day with a drink this whisky is just perfect  i won t profess to being an expert or connoisseur of single malts i do however know my way around a bourbon shelf tomatin 12 doesn t resemble a bourbon except that they are both liquid in form i was in search of a scotch and something different and didn t wish to break the bank one can pay in excess of 85 us for a good bottle of scotch but you don t have to with tomatin 12 it has very good essence and if fulfilling at the price point  the alcohol overpowers the flavors adding some water helped a little  i have to agree with the others who felt that it had hints of turpentine and that it was quite astringent it was a gift gift personally i prefer the peatiness of the islay  somehow the legacy seemed smoother this had an astringency on the nose but the i could detect shortbread leather toffee and vanilla the palate was buttery with citrus and after a few drops of water it became sweeter and the vanilla notes became more pronounced the finish was a long malty finish with leather and pecan a minute later i could still taste the leather  wow great value in the sherry amp vanilla amp heather taste range not much smoke or spice but you won 39 t find a better 12 yr old single malt in the sweeter flavour profiles decent finish good oiliness and mouthfeel at 43 it can handle a few drops of water or a whisky stone not that i ever use one  decent single malt with some good maltiness but the 18 is much better for not that much more  not bad citrus and floral on the nose nutty first wave of flavor transitioning to leather and cinnamon and finishing with a slightly astringent qualities for a 12 year it is of a high quality but i am biased towards highlands interested in the 15 and 18 next  i quite like it lots of fruit for sure citrus on the nose others have said candied apple and i get that too it 39 s much more interesting than most things in this price range for about 35 i 39 m happy with it  pretty sharp finish not for the faint of heart  what a delicious whisky especially for that sort of money stewed apples dates figs and moistened christmas pudding very easy to drink and at the much more appreciated 43 what 39 s not to love at this price  just had my first taste of tomatin 12yrs old marvelous a real whisky for anyone full of flavour that lasts all the way will definitely be savouring again  not my kind of whisky tasted grass and leather to far from ardbeg 10 i do love smoky whisky should say that it was a gift they did obviously not now my kind of whisky so probably great for someone else  well i like it a lot rich and fruity do not recognise two of the critical reviews way off the mark notes of turpentine very slight vanilla and a hint of leather this scotch is what i imagine what gasoline would taste like if it were aged for 12 years for a highland it 39 s harsh and unforgiving though the copy on the box says it 39 s known for its balance and patience it tastes like they started with the cheapest of grains and just let it sit for awhile i 39 d hate to taste what they started with save your taste buds and spend another 30 on a macallan 12  if you like turpentine this is your drink i would rate it just below cheap cologne bottling something this bad should be illegal charging money for it definitely is calling it scotch disgraceful  great whiskey for the value you get what you pay for and this is what you should expect an easy all nighter like someone said eralier in the comments  fine for the price a whiff of sherry a hint of flowers but mostly tastes of oak and has a bourbon ish character fairly sweet light but not lightweight maybe some salt nothing special but a serviceable drink with a clean finish and nothing out of place  not bad at all i got this 39 on sale 39 for around 30 definitely worth the price it 39 s not as good as the other highland scothces in the 40 range but i guess that 39 s why it 39 s 30 i prefer the 39 glens 39 a bit more but it has a fruity taste and hardly any bite an overall decent scotch i 39 d buy again and keep it on hand as a change up  not bad at all got this 39 on sale 39 for just around 30 it 39 s worth the price but defenetly not up there with the other 40 45 highland scotches i prefer the 12 yr old glens much more i guess that 39 s why it 39 s 30 but it 39 s sweet and has that fruity taste with no alcohol bite decent overall i 39 d buy again for that price  neutral to the nose with some cedar like sweetness and light peat definitely no quot bite quot or much of an aftertaste if you want a price driven single malt that is completely inoffensive start here  value for money  got this for 27 and i am very impressed tastes just as good as things i 39 ve spent double that on nothing particularly special about it just a very smooth fruity dram nice and oaky too maybe just a slight hint of salt on the finish for the price probably my new favorite will be buying this again also my bottle looks very different from the one on here looks like the picture of the 18 year and i like it more wasn 39 t a fan of their presentation before so i never tried them but now i am a fan the sugarbear tomatin have got it spot on excellent whisky at fair affordable prices way too mutch elitism with many of the so called big boys of single malt  this is a sweet easy to like scotch whisky for a low price i didn 39 t find anything objectionable about it i saw it on sale for less than 32 00 per 750 and thought i 39 d give it a try glad i did add a few drops of talisker and stump your friends  fabulous no complaints here good flavor and interesting but easy to drink in any setting my more experienced friends agree this is one tasty dram regardless of the price  relatively new to clean scotch but this one is incredible even for me either on the rocks or neat or with a whiskey rock or two smooth and easy to drink and experienced tasters agree doesn 39 t get much better at this price point  this is a good 12 year old it has a nice malty flavor that fills the mouth cirrus and orange notes i drank it with ice a at 22 00 dollars which is rinsplash of water priced right too at 22  did a vertical tasting of the tomatin 12 15 and 18 in one evening and to my surprise i liked the 12 best will do a second tasting of them all independently though just to be sure took plenty of time between tastings and cleansed the palate as well to ensure one didn 39 t influence the other here 39 s what i got surprisingly minimal alcohol on the nose for a 43 abv i thought i got a marzipan ish dried fruit dates and sweet honey aroma with the palate yielding all the same finish was mild sweet and smooth and was medium in length tried again with a splash of distilled water as well as this was the first tasting and found that overall water didn 39 t do much to this dram so i will drink it neat fyi water did do more to open up the 15 amp 18 year olds at least for me  low priced 12 yo the nose is harsh and chemically it does make a good whiskey and soda for the price it would be a good everyday scotch and soda whiskey 
2439.0, great whisky got this for 163 27 in a local shop and was pleasantly surprised first from ancnoc but won t be the last  damn good whisky for hot summer days and cool sunset nights little bit simple and straightforward but who cares it 39 s good  smooth  i am far from an expert here but i find it very smooth a bit sweet finish lingers nicely so the taste remains with you will recommend and buy again  tasted neat vanilla citrus nose with perfume malt possibly horlicks and something reminiscent of spiced rum tropical fruit and shortbread hard to identify exactly but quite nice medium bodied spicy chewy and lingers with brandy like alcohol vapour on the tongue vanilla slight sweet liquorice singed mince pie filling nose is still immediately available after tasting quite long mildly astringent and slightly oak tannin follow through very good for the price complex and will not disappoint i 39 d actually lower the alcohol even more to 37 as i suspect it might highlight more of the stuff going on splash of water will change everything  one of my favorite oaked single malts kind of reminds me of macallan 15 year old oak barrel single malt for those who want a lighter alternative to sherry casked single malts this is a worthy alternative at a very reasonable price  a well balanced single malt fits to anytime i really like it is it only me get an aroma of sandalwood whatsoever i give 4 5 stars for this nice whisky  having paddled a canoe through the knockando rapids 2 years ago and not making time to visit the distillery i purchased a bottle to celebrate the trip lower down the river my preferred tipple is malt whiskey above anything else with ancnoc being a permanent fixture in my home i should drink it with a little more reserve than i do but  very smooth and flavourful it 39 s a cut above the standard malts available at this price i will be buying again  very good whiskey i bought it in ukraine in kiev several times the price is normal great taste  i 39 ve had this whisky in the past and i seem to remember had more 39 ooomph 39 it 39 s still pleasant enough and very easy drinking plenty of fruit i got pineapple vanilla and honey but not as good as i remember it it may have been 46 in the past i suppose for the price it 39 s fair enough but i think when this bottle 39 s finished there will be no more  to the two children who posted the previous comments you have my sympathy and i sincerely hope that in time you learn to appreciate single malt whisky this is clean elegant sophisticated the moment i tasted it the image appeared in my mind of a small gathering of native gaelic speakers sitting around an open fire the remains of a freshly caught salmon in the background with a clarsach gently playing in the background ancnoc is single malt whisky for grown ups for people who don t use an old fashioned to drink it or say on the rocks for those who have no idea what spring break is this is the first time i have ever given a 5 star rating to a whisky on this site  watery boring weak completely uninteresting all in all cheap garbage i suppose if thats your thing then this is the whisky for you but if you want flavour and body 100 avoid this one this is apparently overrated by many i dont understand it jim murray quot highly quot recommends this stuff which is why i do not take him serious he 39 s about as overrated as this whisky the only quot good quot thing about the ancnoc 12 is that every whisky you have after it will taste 10 times better than otherwise including cheap blends  watery in fact more so than highland park 12 utter rubbish total waste of 163 31 would rather drink cat p ss  so delicate and easy to drink like real highland honey  sweet on the nose with subtle hints of green apple looking slightly deeper i find a cinnamon barrel spice with hints of vanilla the initial taste is spicey and peppery which smoothly develops into a sweet honey the journey it takes after that is to a nice dry finish and settles with hints of tabacco great every day drinker  i thought the flavours and balance of this whisky were superb floral nose with sweetness and toasted notes on the palate finish is medium with lovely malt and spice developing a great whisky with excellent balance and subtlety of flavour and for the price easily five stars  fantastic dram with the oily texture so pleasing in spirits such as aberlour a bundach i have this on my bar next to several other fine 12 yr bottles such as highland park and i keep reaching for ancnoc  very good rastreamento almond fresh tobacco and little bit of honey  very smooth i find it nutty for the price this is excellent  love the kick a must for those who like a tingle in the throat  ideal for a beginner a must for an expert this is a great go to malt good for getting your palate in tune sweet touch of sour honey lemon vanilla green apple and malt richness for the money you cannot go wrong very pleasent indeed and a dribble of water really improves it  it 39 s too easy to drink no need to exhale any burn because there is none it just settles on your tongue enjoy the vapors the scent kind of mild not overly sweet bottle disappears too quickly i 39 m too much a novice in these matters to identify the subtleties and interplays noted above yet i think i can tell smoky from sweet and though i prefer sweeter when i want just a whisper of a scent smokier i prefer this ergo this is my second favorite scotch it 39 s usually marked up by about ten dollars though as i have yet to find it in a large chain grocery store  great bang for your buck smooth very enjoyable went down easily surprisingly gentle flavour which had to be followed by a second just to make sure  a very good whiskey very inoffensive but not at all dull nice subtle flavours that dance around both in the taste and finish at the price it 39 s excellent value  this is an excellent highland whisky and a good example of the style non chill filtered and natural color and bottled at 43 give this points before tasting but the flavor is fantastic as well hints of meadow flowers lemon peel honey sweet barley and vanilla with some nice mild oak in there too fantastic malt really good all around i have aberfeldy 12 right now as well but this is a little bit better in my opinion definitely worth buying again i like this one a lot cheers the sugarbear quite bold for a speyside loads of pleasant sweet notes and really easy to drink you can spend much more and get way worse  light silky smooth before you know it theres none left a great warning whisky with nice hints of spice and wood you 39 ll struggle to find better for the money smooth elegant soft yet warm absolute delight i got this as a birthday present and what a gift i can 39 t not wait for a cool new england night outside by the fire place to enjoy some more of this gem  i don 39 t usually drink whiskey but i love this one excellent warm weather whisky light tasting but still full of pleasant hints of honey lemon fruits and floral can 39 t wait for winter to experience it by the fireplace  lovely not getting the medicinal aftertaste others seem to get rather finding it floral with definite honey notes really easy drinking this could go quickly  this whisky has pretty much everything every time i taste it it 39 s a bit different sometimes more lemon y and grassy sometimes more creamy and nutty banana and vanilla in there as well even a bit of peat all that escorted by a malty cereal like taste that is ever present somehow it manages to be both complex and easy drinking all in all a jack of all trades at a price that 39 s hard to beat  ancnoc 12 is almost dreadfully easy to drink i 39 d recommend this to anyone who is new to scotch or wants to try it 39 s quite easy on the nose yet there 39 s a lovely pull of smokiness that intersects perfectly with the sweet honey and floral combo it 39 s really a remarkable bouquet with an incredibly fresh aroma it 39 s taste is also satisfactory for its woody smokiness that lingers on for a while it 39 s not hard to pick up on the softly bitter tartness that dances around with the honeysuckle flavoring which is quite a different taste from most honeys i 39 d say this is a great drink for relaxing it can be enjoyed in the spring and summers and in the winter it 39 ll remind you of blooms  just a fantastic 12 year old i am a big fan of the balvenie doublewood and have had true struggles finding another one that can match up to that though this is one is not in any way matching up to the doublewood it has certainly become my second best choice when it comes to 12 year olds just simply fantastic in every way  really impressed well balanced floral and sweet it 39 s disappeared already  this is a lovely whisky beautiful soft nose of honey and lemons exceedingly smooth and a tropical fruity finish it 39 s sweet even more so with water but if that 39 s what you fancy at the time there aren 39 t many better especially at this price i paired it with glasgow 39 s drygate ipa and it was just the business but beware it 39 s perilously easy to drink  we were three odd fellows who tested a bottle of ancnoc 12 year old to day and we enjoyed it very much it was mild and with an excellant taste of madeira spices and bread crumbs we had some water beside the whisky glasses the afternoon was very much appreciated  had a dram at a friends house and i thought i was drinking dalwhinnie 15 yr scotch for a 12 yr old this is very tasty stuff love to try the 16 yr old try this scotch you will not be upset and for the money you can 39 t go wrong stevie g boston ma scotch nut  nice for a summer drink out on the porch thanks to the fruity and floral notes for the price a few bucks more than glenlivet i felt like i made out like a bandit i might get their 16 next time for when i have people i like over i 39 ll also keep cutty for the people i don 39 t like  thoroughly impressed  probably the best scotch i have ever tasted smooth and full of flavour superb and can compete with bottles 3 times its pricecant go wrong with this whisky try it you wont regret it  this is a well balanced scotch with a smooth and slightly oily mouthfeel and a pleasant herbal oaky bouquet it is definitely light to medium in character so good for the warmer months it has a honeyed character with herbal and grassy overtones with an almost minty aftertaste that lingers and decays into an almost tea like taste overall a very pleasant whisky though not as rich or as satisfying as the glenmorangie 10 quot light but substantial quot sums up its character quite nicely i didn 39 t taste any medicinal quality whatsoever i add 1 small ice cube let it melt for a couple minutes and then swirl i would say this is a great quot starter quot whisky with its light body and most similar to the oban 14 but cheaper  this is a challenging one bitter herbal medicinal a bit of an odd contrast light but substantial there is a nice thickness to the mouthfeel and considerable complexity to the taste and aroma if you like your whisky straightforward this may not be the one for you if you like myself like a whisky to challenge you and deliver a natural quality and complexity this is one you will surely find interesting and enjoyable this natural complexity and quality is getting rare these days it seems to me like many popular single malt scotches seem to be somehow diluted thin and not as good as they used to be no such problems with this one  this to me is lika a three way between glenmorangie 10 dalwhinnie 15 and the great and sadly discontinued scapa 12 let me explain substance structure and complexity backbone from the 39 morangie 10 honeyed heathered delicacy and citrus fruit vibrancy form the 39 whinnie 15 and finally a touch of that wonderful now forever gone coal dusty smokiness from the scapa 12 mor 10 also provides the oak in this my free association mix all in all a superb malt an cnoc 12  to me this whisky is like what merging glenmorangie 10 and dalwhinnie 15 would be like the best of both worlds so to speak all the complexity and oak firmness of the 39 morangie 10 plus all the honeyed delicacy of the 39 whinnie 15 can you dig it i can  додаю бали прочитав відгук евгений из украины і прикупив бутилочку аромат мед 100 при чому гречаний на смак мякий з медовим присмаком післясмак короткий рекомендую за таку ціну один з кращих віскі з регіону хайланд i tend to gravitate toward islay scotches and was given a bottle of this as a gift haven t really enjoyed it neat with ice or with a splash of water to me it has the medicinal quality of an islay without the sea salt or smoke i enjoy i find it extremely sour on the palate and so astringent that it sucks all of the moisture out of my mouth the ancnoc has a very very oily mouthfeel in fairness to the malt there is a pleasant woodiness and an acceptable aftertaste but i really struggle at the beginning of every sip making it something of a chore to get through the sour grassiness of the spirit might sit well with lovers of ipas or lowland malts but i like neither and so the ancnoc will probably continue to sit on the shelf unloved  i get to purchase this for 35 38 dollars us on a regular basis this and monkey shoulder are the best one bottle a week scotch for the money old pulteney is second followed by auchentoshen i recommend this to the newbie in addition to oban 14 as a toe dip into singles try it and you won t be disappointed this is very smooth all the way through  although my flavor profile leans heavily toward peaty smoky salty island like lag 16 talisker 10 and ardbeg oogie this is a delicate and yet complex malt that is very underrated it s flavor profile is closest to the glenlivet nadurra with oak fruit vanilla and grass as predominant notes soft and smooth it it s complexity still offers it an air of mystery that leads to try to savor it to find what makes it work highly recommended first rate inexpensive drama  this is a good whisky very well balanced and flavourful however in this price range the old pulteney 12 is more robust but this is still lovely and a great summer time dram spice cocoa fruits and floral notes all seem to come through in time with water a good amount of lime lovely  flat that s my view on this malt not bad spirit but not great too cask problem tastewise not up to par i will not buy this again  toffee apple and flowers on the nose sweet with to taste with a medium finish of wood and light smoke very well balanced a must have  medical smokey notes should be included in the tasting notes if you don t like those don t buy that whisky there are subtle but definitely noticeable i made a mistake and thought that this whisky in it s own class i guess it s a good buy it feels refined and well made but only if you don t mind that medical aftertaste i do that s why only three stars from me  if you like the more subtle tones of glenlivet glenfiddich or glenmorangie which by the way are great single malts this might not be the scotch for you it s got a very hearty flavor that most might not appreciate but if you love a good strong oak flavor while still very smooth this is the scotch for you sitting in the hot tub now with a triple neat and loving it  this reminds me of jakemans honey and lemon menthol sweets and that s a good thing slightly medicinal a honey sweetness and a touch of citrus very nice indeed certainly a distillery i ll be taking a second look at  the first single malt i ever purchased it was recommended to me based on its balance and would say thats accurate after finishing the bottle i consider the finish to be very crisp and think there are apple notes in addition to those mentioned by mom  not the worst scotch i ever had but the slightly medicinal aftertaste was a big turn off based on the reviews perhaps i got a bad batch bottling  евгений из украины that s easy for you to say  прекрасный солод вкус мед чистый мед без каких либо нюансов где там люди видят задымленность и торф не знаю похож на dalwhinnie 15 но без хересной нотки присущей последнему один из моих самых любимых  the tasting note by the chaps at masters of malt is very accurate particularly the honeysuckle fresh flowers amp cereals it s one of the most floral whiskies i ve come across but one thing i would certainly add to that is citrus fruits like most people mention it certainly has complexity but i ve seen a few reviewers now mention smoke but i really don t how they can say that because i don t get the slightest bit of smokiness a very nicely balanced unique amp great tasting whisky at the right price top stuff   imagine what it could be minus caramel non chill filtered and bottled at 46 imagine x lovely aroma some deep notes quite woody but with a sweet rich undertone absolutely delicious taste similar to a macallan or even a richer nectar d or slight smokiness but no obvious peat v nice  nice sweetness upon entry good malt backbone here great smokiness toward the end almost like a sweeter smoky glenlivet 12 minus the burn  great complexity very rewarding dram there should be a peated version which could beat up ardbeg 
11229.0, absolutely awful on the nose almost akin to manure on the palate it is harsh and peppery any wood or smoke disappears almost immediately and if there is toffee it is well burn just as well it 39 s my old man 39 s bottle because at this price point it is absolutely unforgivable  i find 18 year old inferior to 15 year old in almost all terms up to day moreover the last 18 year old bottle was almost a disaster for the price highly unpleasant nose is ruining everything at once i find this very interesting since this is the third bottle over 3 years and this last one is the worst of all  as with all dalmores this is a beautiful dram however given the price if you are looking for value for money and better taste then the 12 and 15 year old are far superior  very strange not a whisky i liked or would buy again if it didn t cost so much i would have tipped it down the sink most excellent on the nose smooth and warming as it goes down  slight smell of toffee but otherwise a harsh yet bland whisky with zero flavour or longevity extremely disappointing at this price  first time with this can safely say it wont be the last superb  it is good great oak and smooth  well rounded i liked it simply delicious i 39 ve got to admit that it 39 s slightly more harsh than expected on the first draught but after that simply delicious a bit beyond my price bracket but worth saving for a treat  i prefer dalmore 12 over 15 other my favorites are balvenie 14 which i like better than 17 and glenfiddish 18 now i took a chance and paid a big buck for dalmore 18 with delivery to the us and it turned out just outstanding soft silky great chocolate or coffee nose and fruity at the end i can smell empty glass for hours very nice splendid totally worth it  bold and flavorful wonderful nose i tried it back to back with johnny gold 18 and johnny platinum 18 i will dalmore over johnny is to pricey like the others  one of my favorites from the dalmore distillery aged luxury indeed complex nose with hints of dried fruit and sherries oak the flavor is complex and layered with deep sherried oak and chocolate the finish is warm and layered as well warm and fruity and somewhat gently barley sweet to dry sherried oak  this my second bottle of the dalmore 18 yr this is an absolutely perfect whiskey smooth and flavorful  i have to agree with 39 antifreeze 39 the filtering and caramel color not to mention the price are ruining what is otherwise the best dark sweet scotch i 39 d say it 39 s my frequent go to but i haven 39 t bought a bottle in over 2 years i 39 m still searching for a substitute or improvement over this gentleman jack suffices  i am having this whisky for the for the first time i had a few pegs and can tell that it is good and on the stronger side but i enjoy laphroaig better  my desert island whisky smooth as a velvet snake with a depth that allows a new flavour with every drop of water you can disagree but then we must duel if you find you balk at the price the dalmore 12 offers a cheaper alternative  phenomenal there are some elements of wood that detract from the experience close to great but not quite there joakim i have had three x 3cl of this in the last 12 months 1 exquisite fruit cake and raisins a beautiful long lingering aftertaste 2 i later bought a 3cl for xmas and was very disappointed pleasant but nothing outstanding or any lingering flavour 3 again disappointing somewhat harsh had this 3cl not been supplied by master of malt i could have been tempted to query the contents tasted like a supermarket blended whisky all down to personal taste i suppose  i bought a bottle of dalmore valour in a duty free in paris it was apparently a quot travel exclusive quot my favourite dalmore by far found it much more smooth than the 18yr so sad i cannot buy it regularly  this was my introduction bottle to a highland region whisky and i must say it was a pleasant encounter this 18yr is not only is smooth and flavorful in which you shouldn 39 39 t underestimate its ability to smoother your palate it makes you really appreciate the time spent on making such a fine whisky especially aging it in 3 ways before bottled  this used to be one of the best whiskies in the world but after 2008 it turned into a cheap caramel colored alcoholic beverage which is good only for windscreen washing tank every illegal gypsy distillery in bulgaria produces better stuff so mister richard paterson go ahead continue embarrassing yourself acting clown in idiotic tv shows and expect somebody to buy your crap  don t get me wrong this is a quality whisky but there have been other whiskies i ve enjoyed more for less money like dalmore cigar malt bunnhabhain 18 ballantines 17 to name but a few  great presentation i keep the box on my bookshelf it looks like a book so it keeps the bar raiders aka friends away this whiskey really grew on me i didn t like it at first because with the sherry influence i was expecting the sweetness of a glendronach or the punch of a macallan 18 i didn t get that here it s a totally different beast all together at first i felt it was flat and didn t offer much however after i drank a few more drams i started to pick up on the nut notes like walnuts brazil nuts and peanuts and i fell in love it s definitely worth the money great dram something unexpected  i really love dalmore s whiskies but honestly have to say that 15 yrs is even better than this cigar malt lose in taste for both  very good a good winter dram with its chocolates notes and dark fruit but remove the chill filtering and colouring and it will be so much better i can only imagine those flavours with filtering  my son brought me a bottle back from scotland when he was there this is the nicest scotch i have ever had smooth tasting nice notes a good balance on the palate hope i get another bottle this year  wow i m very fond of this dalmore 18 yo one of my favourite for sure i would only imagine how it would taste the bottle i saw at the quot whisky experience quot in edimburg last year a dalmore distilled in 1966 and now aged 48 yo gp i don t normally do this at all but after having gone through tons of different scotches i simply must let the rest of the world know how great this malt actually is yes the price maybe near to or over 100 euro s but it is worth every cent of that pick it up now  this is an incredible spirit one of my favourites along with the smoky jura prophecy and the ardbeg  read the reviews and gave it a try beautiful the nicest whisky i have tasted the only problem was the wife wanted a taste and her eyes opened wide as she tasted it lovely she said dam we shared the bottle over the weekend got myself another one  smooth and delicious outstanding dram without doubt my favourite by a country mile if you like this try glenfarclas very decent but still no match for the dalmore even the 12yo is superior  a very good dalmore and good value for money if you can push your budget a bit higher try the king alexander iii i still believe that dalmore 18 and king alexander iii are the best whiskeys ever made  really enjoyed this whisky great smell of burnt butterscotch very enjoyable this is the nicest whisky i ve sampled so far the aroma is pleasing and the flavor is quite enjoyable it s not overly sweet just right given the price i can t see myself buying a bottle but the sample was well worth a try karl dalmore s 18 year is exactly as the notes state and exactly what you d expect want from this range a good dram  in your face warmth sweetness like i d never experienced before powerful sherry from start to finish i m in love with this hate watching the bottle slowly disappear 
1713.0, i am trying this for the first time and it is a very tasty scotch and i love the color i had some friends at work tell me about it and i 39 m glad they did i will continue to buy this scotch in the future i am a finicky scotch drinker but i have found my calling keep up the hard work and continue producing this fine scotch  i have never tasted a whisky that was so rich in flavor when this reached the back of my mouth it was like being in heaven too bad it 39 s been discontinued because this was my all time favorite  really good and smooth scotch  for many years my favorite single malt has been the glenrothes 1991 14yr it has just surpassed by the aberlour 16  forgot to rate i liked the 12 but now the 16 just blew me away i am on my way to the 18 looking forward to it but not a patch on the 12 year old double cask which was sublime  i m not an expert i don t know from nose all i know is when i like something i cannot get the singleton in my state any longer the guy at the store reco d this and it was on sale i like it and the empty bottle will be a nice home for my olive oil  has to be the bargain of the century  superb stuff first tried this a couple months ago and hadn t realized i had backup bottle will indulge a dram or two tonight nice enough though not keen on the whole aberlour range to be totally honest we went on a distillery tour and tasting when we visited scotland this was my favourite out of all the ones i tasted at aberlour and definitely the one i would get if i decided to get some aberlour  we opened the bottle and four of us tasted it with a small amount of ice to keep the alcohol effect on the moth to a min all four were so pleasantly surprised and the smoothness and the flavor great sipping whiskey to say the least 4 thumbs up it did lose a little in my book due to the cost but  nose nice i like this a bit vaporous from the alcohol but that tiny flaw is quickly forgiven when lovely floral nectar honey vanilla sweet malt and fresh fruits reveals itself taste floral nectar and honey sweet fresh fruits but also a touch of dried fruits a tiny bit of spice long sweet finish even though i can detect a few flaws here and there with this dram there is just something about it that grabs me it has that magic spark that makes you forgive its tiny imperfections  i m glad this was my first bottle of aberlour very nice with a hint of spice that made my tongue tingle i m now setting about trying more from this distillery  one of my colleagues gave me this today as a gift not a bad choice i need more friends like him  one of the best affordable aberlour ever complex generous perfectly balanced and matches really well with food from starter to dessert believe me 
1947.0, not going to bore you with recollections of quot front nose this and body taste that notes of blah blah pretentious exposition to make me sound sophisticated quot f ing yawn it 39 s a good scotch is you want something mild smooth and enjoyable definitely for those who prefer a scotch with little to no peat smokiness it 39 s also light on the bandage taste as well which is a bonus for me buy it try it don 39 t like it don 39 t buy it again not everything is for everyone everything is for everyone to try at least once bought mine for 60 in the us  big mouth feel very smooth but not sweet i prefer peated malts but i 39 d much rather serve this to guests who don 39 t i can 39 t see anyone disliking it  received as a present very smooth and lovely nose and flavour mild on the nose the taste is simple but outstanding absolutely full of sherry with subtle notes of other flavours like citrus and probably the smoothest whisky i 39 ve had so far goes down so easily it 39 s best to buy several bottles at once it is one of the best whisky that i ever had in my life its not crap its not great fancy packaging low abv honestly though if you like this style of sherried whisky naked grouse is better glendronach 12 is in another league  this is a special one it smells very different from what i have tasted so far with a very distinct butter caramel nose almost going to cheese then you get the fruity orange at the back the palate is subdued at first then orange marmalade opened up with a hint of lemon zest near the end the ending is spicy with lingering fruity taste overall i think it was good but not great still prefer my glenmorangies  nice single malt not sophisticated very pleasant with a sweet chocolate finish  bad expensive doesn 39 t smell anything and very light taste seems like a mix of water caramel and alcohol  i drink whisky that i love the taste of and this along with dalwhinnie 15 are my current favourites forget the snobbery from the experts if you want something smooth refreshing and very drinkable as an evening dram you won t go far wrong with this  people seem to care much about chill filtering and caramel colouring but if it tastes great who cares stop overthinking it whisky is made to be enjoyed i like the smokier stuff but if i 39 m in a mood for something more elegant dalmore is my go to  smoothest whisky by far orange from the start to finish it s like eating an orange concentrate cooked with vanilla and spices in an old wooden warehouse delicious and smooth but tendency to be boring  the smoothest whisky by far orange from the start to the finish it s like eating sweet orange concentrate cooked with vanilla extract and spices in a old damp wooden warehouse smooth delicious but tendency to be boring  very smooth but a little too much on the sweet side for my tastes  old musty wood dominated stay away  on the nose it has buttery nutty and complex fruity nuances with distinct orange zest notes very complex and beautiful on the palate it has some vanilla cinnamon caramel and white chocolate notes very rich and smooth finish medium to long with citrus nuances with distinctive orange notes  if you enjoy whisky stay away from dalmore there are much better malts out there that are not duping you out of 163 40  so smoooth amp rich  terrible overpriced whisky tastes like brown water sugar and chemicals  very light on the tongue smoooooth caramel and cocoa nose not a big finish consistently smooth from the start 3 5 stars  nice whiskey get some water add some brown sugar and caramel e150 and voila dalmore 12  stop buying overpriced caramel coloured bland brown liquid and buy the proper stuff that has been well made if you want a good highland malt try wolfburn it s young but it s honest good liquid not coloured like dalmore non chill filtered just a great dram unlike dalmore  this is the 1st time i have tried dalmore 12 as i sipped and l let it wet my mouth into my tongue it awakens my taste buds it 39 s smooth a hint of sweetness and alcohol content as you exhale i believe it depends on a person 39 s palate preference on how one enjoys their drinks i am no expert but i would add this to my collection line up with my hibiki harmony johnnie walker 18 and nikka coffee grain whisky for beginners would recommend dalmore 12 for a start  feels watered down could do with being a higher strength been drinking this for a couple of months and feel the quality declines over time might be due to oxidation but here 39 s the strange thing that happens whenever i 39 ve had a dalmore in the cupboard it always seems to go down too quickly i 39 d put this in an everyday dram category if you 39 re after more complexity try the 15yo the more seasoned whisky drinker should look past this but i 39 m definitely not disappointed either  i share the opinion of others that dalmore have done some of the most work to harm their brand 39 s standing with the informed drinker to even find versions not dyed bright orange or sewerage brown or with higher volumes for the more affordable lower vintages f eg in independent bottlings the premium tends to be ridiculous the malt itself might be good but what they do to it does not justify the expense and the pretentious marketing executive orientation of the brand i 39 ve never tasted a dalmore that is anything other than decent and when the luxury price is factored in it represents horrible value for money i hope one day for a correction in brand identity as at the moment it 39 s fully reliant on tricking people into paying more for less  on the nose it is amazingly elegant with sweet nutty nuances some caramel coffee orange and cereal nuances also can be noted on the palate the same nuences can also be noted together with milk vanilla and sweet chocolate notes finish is medium to long still sweet even lady drinkers may enjoy this beautiful whisky  watery with almost no finish skip this one  i suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion however to leave a review without trying the whisky is nothing short of outright stupidity and to compare it to a supermarkets own brand is ludicrous to those who have purchased and don t like it i respect that at least you gave it a go whisky s complex and diverse and one mans pleasure is another mans poison i like this one pleasant and easy to drink in my opinion 5 stars great value for money  the reviews for this are abysmal if you read them you wouldnt purchase it bottle looks stylish but the contents leave a lot to be desired wont be buying after reading the bad reviews i got it on a steep discount and hey that helped the nose has a mix of nice dried fruit plum is there and chocolate on the very edge very low viscosity for a 12 year taste is relatively tame and hollow there is a mild burn a slight fruity character a tiny bit of salty finish and a cooling mint at the very end but all in all it 39 s pretty one note  don 39 t bother if you hate raisins  a nice smooth whisky but for the price i prefer glenfiddich or glenmorangie i am generally reticent when it comes to opining about the positive or negative qualities of a product but i must be honest in saying this was a case of excellent marketing kudos as i was persuaded and unfortunately dreadful quality with due respect to the poetic apologists arguing in defense of this whisky i cannot justify my own mistake in buying this scotch it is style over substance an excellent 12yr old whisky richer and tastier than most 12yr olds i 39 ve tried and ive tried 40 i know a beginner in a lot of eyes 128514 i find it sits somewhere between a dalmour 12 and the 16 if your into sweet and non smoky or peated whiskies this is for you  velvety goodness smooth and leathery with a hint of smoke i 39 d prefer this over others in its range also since when is 12 years considered quot young quot fantastically balanced with a great finish  nice box bottle presentation the whiskey itself mediocre meh it is very much spirit driven as it is young also as you might have guessed it 39 s colored not complex nose orange dried plum amp apricot small hint of dark chocolate taste everything mentioned above slightly oily mouthfeel fast finish overall young nothing special as it is with bowmore dalmore and other quot paymore quot brands they normally go for about 20 30 more than other comparable brands truth be told if it was without e150 coloring agent and wasn 39 t chill filtered with more age it could make a decent drink but as is it is simply not worth it  love it  kind of malt brandy lovers will like a great 12 year old whisky of course it lacks a bit of character due to its age but great all the same fruity and round i still prefer some of the glens but many of the haters i have read in these reviews were probably expecting a 21yo for the money great whisky for the value i have not tried this but i have heard that it appears to be very similar to the coop own brand highland single malt 12yo which is usually about 163 22 and brilliant value for what it is maybe someone familiar with the dalmore should try this if they are so similar i wouldn 39 t pay 163 41 for the dalmore  it 39 s not better than black label or chivas and smells of poor quality spirit being the basic dalmore so i told myself dal less  my friends drank mine for me before i could get any of it so i 39 m out a awesome wiskey am can 39 t afford another bottle right now but i will try soon to get me some more love the bottle lovely nose and palate orangey caramel hint of fruitcake then it just dies and has practically zero finish very odd it is very smooth though there 39 s no burn or nasty aftertaste it just lacks any character go glendronach 12 yo for everything that dalmore lacks  although the delivery is quite silky and charming rest is just a sulfured mess under powered 40 caramel colored a very mediocre single malt  yeah put me in the ranks of those who are unimpressed don 39 t mind that it 39 s sweet or unpeated but it just doesn 39 t seem to have a lot going on may try to do some blending with a touch of ardbeg love the bottle the rest is nothing to write home about no spice no smoke no depth  terrible watered down no complexity just a horrible whisky dalmore you shoulf be ashamed to call this a whisky  i am just now finishing a bottle of the pre 2008 whisky which is superb but it obviously is not the same whisky as the new fangled dalmore 12 yr my old bottle is 43 abv and is not the dark amber color i e the pre 2008 whisky probably does not have caramel food coloring my next purchase will not be dalmore 12 yo because i have no need for a cheap cost reduced single malt  this is a lovely whiskey smooth and easy on the draw true not the most complex just lovely  was blown away by how good this is i 39 m typically a beer drinker so if i go to the liquor side of things i actually usually drink bourbon been hearing and reading good things about dalmore so bought a bottle of 12 year at my local liquor store 2 weeks ago and nearly killed the whole bottle with a friend of mine that night so damn good smooth as silk if i drink liquor i usually need ice but by glass 3 that night i was drinking it clean and loving it even more great scotch and drinking the remainder of the bottle as i 39 m writing this  slightly above average for me dark orange and chocolate notes missing a bit of heat  i think this it 39 s a great whisky  show me a whisky which isn 39 t improved by being cask strength and i 39 ll show you a poor whisky this is crying out for a few more points of abv but having said that it 39 s still a very decent scotch if you can afford it grab the king alexander mindblowingly good  smells nothing needs 5 more abv peppery and that 39 s all tastes nothing pure marketing just beautiful bottle i think the one problem with this is that it is only 40 abv i don 39 t recall every having another heavily sherried malt that was less than 43 glendronach 12 edradour 10 glenfarclas 12 and tamdhu 10 all come to mind they are all slightly better and about 10 cheaper in the nyc long island area this has a unique taste heavy on the orange marmalade would be great stuff at 43 with more body i should think the older expressions would be great but i 39 m really not into spending that much money after having this ok so right off the bat i have to say it 39 s not the masculine isley that punches you in the mouth at first swill but that 39 s not what i want when i just get home from work the sexiness is in its sweetness and it 39 s like the familiar kiss of a spouse after a hard day at the office and that 39 s exactly what some of us need  excellent a perfectly good dram that has some crepe and cappuccino in the nose a bit of peat on palate with some of the pastry from the nose then finishing with some spice to it a nice inoffensive entry level dram  not offensive but lacks conviction vigor strength seems to be a whiskey formulated to be pleasant for everyone but with no particular destination opposite of a whiskey that makes a statement and creates a lasting impression  i own already the cigar malt and the 15 year and now got to taste the 12 year in the mom advent calendar despite the not so enthusiastic reviews below i was pleasantly surprised it is true that it is not overly complex and doesn 39 t have too long of a finish well it 39 s a 12 year one but it has a nice rounded profile with a smooth creamy sweetness which makes it a good companion to your every day cigar  the nose is nice when you let it stand without swirling you can clearly smell the coffee otherwise it is a rather classic cherry smell but promising the beginning of the palate is nice without being crazy but i would say in line with you would expect from a 12 yo single malt but then the alcohol arises i don 39 t mind at all a strong drink i 39 m actually a fan of the cask strenght versions but here the alcohol doesn 39 t enhance or empower the taste but on the contrary clash with it it is what is dominant for the finish un untasty burn it 39 s far from being discussing but the finish is disappointing  tasted blind initially intense both on the nose and the palate but quickly falls apart in the short and almost lean finish heavy on the sherry with an orange heavy citrus character that reminded me of px that aside dark honey and some just perceptible floral notes no appreciable aftertaste conclusion totally forgettable but a good one to warm up the palate for something better to come  en ganska tjock oljig doft toffifee finns d 228 r margarin

orange zest espresso oils it 39 s not bad at all i like the color it smells really good smooth dram a tiny bit medicinal which is not for me however there is a lot of aroma and a neat combination of flavors i 39 d like to taste a more aged version of this to see if these flavors overpower the alcohol a bit more it 39 s not bad at all  can 39 t believe i actually bought it what a huge disappointment my friends did warn me about its poor quality and ridiculous price but i did not listen it tastes like sweetened ink with almost no finish i really wish they could refund my money  it 39 s a cheap tasting whisky with a premium visual presentation  over colored and lifeless this is by far the worst whisky i 39 ve ever tasted shame on you dalmore  thinking man 39 s whisky fading autumnal light in late november with duck and geese flying in formation old friends old memories thick persian rug under your feet and aged seasoned wood glowing in the fireplace flickering candles  in terms of 12 yrs this is one of the best and its taste is fabulous i specifically feels it has dark chocolate and bitter cocoa notes that i didn 39 t find in any 12 yrs and having a sherry cask finish makes it more subtle and medium to long finish value or money  this is quite mild for such a dark colored scotch of 12 years while not being a bad malt after nosing and initial taste the after taste it left me with was not pleasant this was after a visit to the distillery where it is made and that was a very strange place it is possibly the dingiest distillery i have visited but that maybe due to it location battling with the elements of the beautiful cromerty firth i always love the smell that hits your when you visit the storage warehouses but i was hit with nothing but mildew and damp with a wiff of seagull poop the delightful angels share was being wasted on sea birds only maybe that was the after taste i found  delightful nose uncomplicated palate citrus finish could use a bit more edge  i would give dalmore 12 a better note if it wasn 39 t 55 in france clearly overpriced by a fair margin consider buying it if you can have it for 35 max very classic sherry sherry nose sherry mouth with a huge note of peanut for me the finish is sherry too classic but nothing to write home about at the same time had it for more than the glendronach 12 the latter is infinitely superior to dalmore 12  very interesting scotch whisky allow it to set untouched for a few minutes and caramel notes with a hint of coffee take presidence afterwards swirl the dalmore 12 and notes of whiskey are superior a fun surprise  very promising presentation bottle is a nice blend of modern and rustic color is amazing artificially 1 star very light start almost as if i was drinking it with ice and they melted before my first sip i got hints of a maple syrup and bitter chocolate blend quite easy and nice on the palate a subtle but warm burn really not terrible but tastes very watered down 1 star if you are looking for a light shallow easy drinking scotch i think this qualifies but don 39 t expect too much character  with a bit more time and some oxidation this whisky has opened up with blood oranges being at the forefront of the nose and chocolate toffeee and deep down coffee the palate is still light with no flavors truly jumping out at me the barley is what sticks out the most to me all in all nothing too impressive it is a refreshing dram and one that would be a nice before dinner drink but not something that i would go out of my way to buy  monstrous coffee honey and butterscotch quickly evolves to an ever so brief grand marnier orange and then onto and ending with a malty woodsy note very nice indeed at 43  as far as scotches go this is not one for me very heavy with the sherry and leaves a not so good after taste in your mouth the nose is very orange great scotch for the price not as great as other dalmore or other options but a great nose and a great color orange finish is also very well liked  got this in the states and boy am i sorry i purchased it has a weird taste and smell of raw burnt wood along with nail polish put these things together and you have an overpriced bottle of crap in my opinion like one reviewer said save your money  but certainly not the best please dalmore you have the quality why continuing chill filter and caramel colouring your whisky deserves better sorry if my english wasn 39 t corect i 39 m from denmarkcheersthe danish clansman wasn 39 t too impressed the first time i tried it but then a day or two later you find yourself thinking about it really needs a few drops of water to open up in my opinion i 39 ve started noticing a bit of hot maple syrup to the nose on my last dram and it 39 s really quite enjoyable won 39 t hit you over the head take some time to really dive into it  in terms of value for money this is my number 1 i get bitter dark chocolate a touch of coffee and a touch of tangy orange with notes of vanilla and walnut smooth deep long and complex the dalmore 18 is my absolute favourite in fact i 39 m going to have one now but the 12 began my dalmore love in  not a better scotch for the price  got as a present enjoyed greatly lots of strong vanilla notes and enjoyed with a partagas 4  simply great for this price definitely not complex it is what it is an easy going warm sherry and nut hug of a dram slightly too expensive for a 12 but a welcome addition to my whiskey cupboard nevertheless would give it 3 5 stars but can 39 t so i 39 ll round up rather than down  my favourite 12yo by far great sherry cask and verry tasty for such a young one splendid i really wanted to like this malt and the rich amber plus 3 color of the whiskey advertises what should be a robust and complex flavor the tasting notes however were a major let down the dalmore at this age mark lacks the complexity and richness of flavor you would expect from a 12 year old and especially one at this price point i absolutely agree that this malt tastes a bit diluted and i feel certain there is a great deal of caramel e 150 additive in this spirit at this price point old pultney provides a much better and cheaper highland option  hard on palate its kind of expensive for this quot entry level quot standard i was expecting a bit more not too complex and slightly watered down lovely colour that 39 s completely fake its a totally decent mass produced industrial whisky i got this as a present nice bottle and dark colour creates expectations disappointment very dull with no depth agree it 39 s a bit the watery keep away from this one there are lot better ones in this price range  heavy on the sherry and not that complex  delightful with a cigar and a schubert serenade this whisky tasted quite watered down to me i 39 ve poured a few glasses neat and its remarkable how it really does taste like at least 2 tsp of water was added the nose is pretty nice with chocolate and marshmallow very prominent the taste is somewhat bland with much more to be desired i agree that this has been over processed and could definitely use less coloring its darker at 12 years old than most whisky that 39 s 25 years old i bought this about a year ago and it 39 s still sitting around about 2 3 full i don 39 t really desire drinking it but i may in the future who knows this malt is amazing i can tell that it is despite it 39 s presentation i appreciate the concept of a fancy bottle and all but it 39 s so weirdly brown and weirdly thin to my palette i would happily pay the same amount of money for it with a less dramatic bottle i have no idea if this affects the price point in their defense no chill filtering higher percentage and a bit less of the brown coloring maybe a brown bottle that 39 s how good it is  nothing to make this one stand out for me  i have tried a variety of single malt scotches the dalmore 12 is by far the most complex and overall great whisky at this age and at this price range strongly recommend this whisky to anyone looking to try other single malts  chill filtered to oblivion and chock full of caramel coloring not offensive but very little complexity due to the heavy processing this would probably be great if whyte and mackay kicked up the proof and did away with the coloring and chill filtering same with jura good malt for the beginner or causual malt drinker who prefers whisky on ice boring for the experienced malt enthusiast  ive gad drams from here to scotland and this is as close as youll get to a 25 year anyday for this price the nose smells of a warm book leather and has tastes of leather and candied fruit finishes just as stated coffee and chocolate sad part the finish is short but wow smooth and wonderfull your not going to find better at this price color deep ambernose dried fruit raisins a small drop of water allows it to open up with a bit more fruitinesspalate gentle delivery soft sherry and vanilla notes finish clean gentle sherry a nice after dinner dram this is good but might be outstanding at a higher abv  amazing great go to digestif subtle flavors and a smooth finish don 39 t bother with the rocks if you are looking to impress someone by drinking your scotch neat this one is for you  tried it with a flight of single malts mccallan 18yr and glenlivet 18 yr the dalmore 15 year was far better went to total wine and purchased 12 year as they were out of 15 don 39 t know about all the flavors you mention above but it 39 s my quot go to quot scotch now  i was disappointed in this i felt like it lacked a ton of complexity and is simple a scotch that is wasted on the experience drinker there are better bottles at cheaper price points do yourself a favor and don 39 t buy it after a 20 minutes of resting and a great cigar just lit i took my first sip smooth with a sweet finish a gentle warmth and i was hooked in to say the least i enjoyed this dram very much although not my favorite but a second buy absolutely a must try  received as christmas gift amp am throughly enjoying it  сильно переоценен виски хороший но никаких индивидуальных особенностей нет my favourite whisky in this price range good solid flavours pleasing on the pallet a very soft whisky fantastic the raisins kept coming through for me on the nose as someone mentioned before the promise of sweetness didn 39 t come through on the palate as the nose had promised prefer a little more warmth in the finish but the aftertaste of fruits and black coffee is quite pleasant definitely needs no water  for an entry level whisky this isn 39 t bad it doesn 39 t quite live up to the entry level lagavulin or ardberg but overall it 39 s not something you 39 d get sick of drinking after a few drams but likewise it won 39 t redefine your view of whiskey for 38 quid it isn 39 t a waste of money and if you pick it up in duty free definetly worth the while my personal view it 39 s of a similar standard not sayin they taste similar to that of a glenfiddich 15 year beautiful nose and taste to match gourmet orange chocolate and rich espresso so rich and decadent i almost forget there 39 s alcohol in this stuff until my chest warms as if being wrapped in a nice warm blanket next to a cozy fire dalmore 12 is my kind of experience  this used to be one of the best whiskies in the world but after 2008 it turned into a cheap caramel colored alcoholic beverage which is good only for windscreen washing tank every illegal gypsy distillery in bulgaria produces better stuff so mister richard paterson go ahead continue embarrassing yourself acting clown in idiotic tv shows and expect somebody to buy your crap  one of my favorite 12 year old schotches like the bottling note says very rich for a 12 year old   where has the rich dark round and fullness gone dalmore 12 used to be one of the greats and now seems to the more mature palate like just many another sherried malt of which there are still others to be found or is this another gone to be hidden in the sales and marketing jungle of fancy packaging to disguise less complexity in the bottle possibly or appear as a fancy expensive expression further up the range disappointing to a longtime consumer or could just be that owner maltman s taste ha changed in my opinion in the wrong direction why mess with success  this whisky tastes nothing like the description of the tasting note by the chaps at master of malt i tend to agree with the chap who title his review quot mildew and wet ashtrays quot oily bland and simple no complexity to find here the blend black grouse has more going for it than the dalmore 12 year old  nose like being in a warm and comforting kitchen with an open hearth malt and grains figure prominently at the first yeasty fresh baked bread and cinnamon buns becoming floral and sweeter as it sits and eventually exposing pineapple upside down cake and bitter citrus palate not as sweet as the nose promised but it enters clean fresh and not syrupy bright chalk and minerals evolving into a subtle darkness sweet pipe tobacco and cigars rum raisin cake croissants new leather and spanish cedar smooth and silky finish like the palate quick and very clean from someone who prefers a lingering finish i really like how this one does it i went looking for the dalmore 15 but i decided to give the 12 a try when it was out of stock i was not disappointed this is a very nice whisky i didn t get as much orange as some have described and the finish ended too quickly but i m very satisfied at the price point summary i am enjoying this dram immensely and am now much more looking forward to the 15 which should concentrate and draw out the finish nicely  sour apple pear and citrus aromas along with butter and sea breeze peppery flavor floral leather with a nice punch of nuttiness during the finish caramel syrupy mouthfeel be very judicious with water but a drop or two brings out lots of nut flavor and smooths out the finish  tonight i made a manhattan from the last of a dalmore 12 year old scotch that was given to my husband prior to 2008 he passed away in september 2008 he loved manhattans and i decided to remember him tonight by having one in his memory i enjoyed it immensely  that soaked wood taste stands out for me not a top pick but a nice change  if whiskey could go off this is what it would taste like whilst there are some floral and nutty aromas in the background the smell of mildew is overpowering and the after taste instantly reminded me of a time when i was about 12 and had a swig of my dads near empty can of vb only to discover he d been using it as an ashtray tastes nothing like a 70 bottle of highland malt should taste don t waste your money on this one the whiskey had very complex flavors it started of smooth and tasted almost like butter but had a nice kick to the end after having a bite of a pear tart and then tasting the whiskey i enjoyed it a lot more in the end i would say that it s not revolting  heart warming sweet and sort of a curvy feminine sensation really enjoyable and special  i m now having trouble enjoying the drinking of other 12 year old scotches after this the scent and taste combine to make drinking this dalmore nothing but a celebration no ice no mixer no unnecessary additions nothing but straight from the bottle into a glass and flowed into the senses the bottle was over too quickly i ve had as good and even better but not at this price and or years  you guys can all suck my balls this dram is the best for its price the sweetness can be smelled on this lovely dram almost too sweet but the feeling of fullness in the mouth makes up for it finish is way too short though still can t help but think of this as a favorite in my young scotch trying life  can t get the fresh honeycomb off the brain orange peel plays second fiddle to the bees wax simply devine frist bottle of scotch i bought tasteless to me maybe it was just the bottle i bought very disapointed the nicest smoothest most flavoursome whiskey in scotland unmatched my world whiskey awards under 163 45 in joint first we have a scotsman irishman and japanese man mr dalmore mr green spot and mr yamazaki jason breen just perfect delicious somewhat disappointed i tried this is a hotel bar the smell and the taste were imo generally not the greatest and a bit off putting some of the reviews i d read were very positive on this whisky and included blind tasting from people entrenched in the whisky industry i note the review i d read was dated from 2005 so maybe this latest release isn t as good this was on my list of bottles to buy no longer off all the whiskies i ve tried recently this was the least enjoyable  i just had a couple drams glendronach 12 and then tried this next i went right back to the dronach and didnt even think of having another dram of dal 12 and the dronachs 10 bucks cheaper o o my first ever whisky and i loved it the nutty coffee taste with the lovely finish is perfect a great introduction to whisky  dalmore 12 to me is very smooth i get a nutty vanilla coffee i highly recommend trying it with some good quality dark chocolate it s beautiful  really enjoyed this one with cuban cigar with coffee flavour an this really good combination  the taste just like a very simple malt whisky without surprise always feel bitter when swallowing  it blows my mind why the reviews are so low this is one of the best i have tried it s smooth yet still a lasting taste top notch scotch with several aromas and a nice sweet chocolatey finish will always keep one on the shelf for a celebratory occasion  stop chill filtering adding hideous brown dye and bottle at a slightly higher strength and i ll definitely buy a bottle until then dalmore wallow in your own self conscious pretentiousness most expensive malt indeed x as a great malt drinker i thought i had had the best but this is excellent malt and i am happy to share this one is my old time favorite whisky tried many different kinds  got given my first dalmore 12 as a present wonderful citrus and sherry nose beautifully smooth on the palate again with citrus and malt notes and that wonderful sherry finish wow like an old friend to spend the evening with leigh h as stated it is ok  a beautiful smooth dram gives a kick without burning out the roof of your mouth a great present for someone who is a bit nervy about trying a single malt  i was reading my tasting notes and just read theirs it s dead on i had coffee with cream orange zest and christmas pudding written down they basically nailed it in one fell swoop fantastically smooth and the nose matches the taste almost identically nothing to hide in this one what you see is what you get and what you get is a pretty damned good dram  nb my bottle says 43 but can t find any info on that particular bottle first impression rich warm smooth and full definite sherry notes roasted coffee for sure and underlying caramel added some water which i felt made it lose it s body but enhanced the coffee note overall this has a truly great flavour this evening we ve also tasted tullamore dew and ballentine s finest and the dalmore is another world  it s a good not too extravagant whisky but not super duper smart drinkers buy this from easily the smoothest and tastiest single malt i ve been fortunate to taste  i thought it was rather bland maybe i m just used to laphroig but i didn t find it to be interesting or complex  seattle pastry counter fruit bowl while that might be evocative it is just not right tone it down guys this is a chill filtered and coloured dram i have that from the distillers but with character it starts sweet and rolls to bitter before coming back to sweet loads of interest and flavours along the way worth the money i think so now but i did not at first taste  this was my first bottle of scotch after drinking only jack eagle rare etc i am now converted the mix of flavours in this scotch stand out so well and mix beautifully on the pallet  smoothest scotch tasted so far even my gf thinks that and she s not drinker at all  i tried it after reading the reviews and article in whisky magazine very tasty and mellow an easy drink not overly complex but for a 30 whisky its a nice smooth unobtrusive dram i have better whiskies in my cupboard for sure but maybe not for this price  hmmmmm don t quite know what all the fuss is about old pultney is soooooo much better but hey still good enjoy great tasting whisky hmmm excellent whiskey definite notes of marmalade and a touch of sweetness one of my favourites the rating for the scotch should be higher on previous statement love the scotch it does have a orange taste on the finish but the sherry and vanilla notes are also prominate a beautiful blend  james bruce recommended this to me and im forever grateful wonderful after kick rounds of the night perfectly broomhead really dissapointed read great reviews but massive let down what you want well what i want in a daily dram is something that is easy to enjoy this whisky is definately easy to enjoy very smooth semi sweeet my wife can even enjoy it with an added cube of ice she is not a whisky person at all a great scotch for someone wanting to get into the next level beyond the standards  a great whisky i really like the orange and the looooooooooong finish  actually i don t like orange taste but i think it s a glorious whisky this newer expression of the 12 yo changed from the previous one the original 12 yo was good but obviously topped up with caramel this one is much better without the artificial flavouring superb mix of orange fruit and cocoa slightly expensive for a distillery s basic expression but worth it  tastes like chocolate oranges also nutty peels some sherry love it 
2810.0, it 39 s fine not exceptional  as with all talisker the nose is exactly what you expect with the volume turned up someone who didn t spend time with this liquid could definitely be underwhelmed but it s so not those 18 years in sherry bourbon almost give me distillery edition vibes of that pure sherry but there is much more underneath to be discovered a must for tally fans  i must say i am not a talisker fan boy i had couple bottles before this one the 10 yo which was very average the 57 north which i did not like much thanks to this earthy peat and strong chili note and the talisker de that i actually really enjoyed i bought this bottle with no particulare expectations it is by far the best talisker i ever had and simply one of my favorite whisky a bit like the sprinbank 10yo this whisky has everything so many aroma and sooooo well balanced the peat is obvious but do not takes over and it still has this particular salinity that makes this talisker one of a kind i am very suprised and happy to finaly find out what great job talisker can do a must have on his shelf  i like a whisky that is smoky peaty with a subtle sweetness and a touch of spice talisker 18y o blends those characteristics to the point of pure perfection with a complexity of taste nose and finish that really makes you think it certainly isn t cheap that s for sure and whether it is worth almost treble the price of the 10y o talisker is open to debate but for me it ticks every box and is the perfect drop to put in a decanter and savour when you fancy something a bit special  i had 2 3 glasses of this one earlier this year the way it delivers comes in smooth and matured i say it 39 s one of the greats but i didn 39 t really like it too much the flavour profile didn 39 t match 100 to my taste buds but it 39 s really smooth and tasty you don 39 t notice the burn  wonderful dram very complex and very restrained the saltiness and peat are not at the forefront but linger in the background whilst the peppery malty fruitiness take over this isn 39 t sherry bombed fruit though this is stone fruit with some stewed apple notes it 39 s really good but once left go open up for a few weeks fantastic 100 recommend  considering this is talisker famed for it 39 s peat saltiness this is a surprising delicate dram which is really well rounded and very different from the classic 10 which i love the first nosing after opening the bottle is heavily phenolic metallic and intense and not unlike the 10 in some ways after a few days open this typical harshness melts away and it is all sweetness and fruit and very little of that typical character the saltiness is always there and it 39 s what makes it stand out as a really exceptional dram but it is delicate and understated i like this a lot and think it is a really good sophisticated dram but i could understand someone who was a passionate 10 yr old fan a peat head lets say being somewhat underwhelmed as it does not have that in your face character i really like it but would i buy this or the 10 next time honestly the 10 is so good for it 39 s price i 39 d probably opt for it but this is worth your time and worth trying  this is a truly astonishing whisky compress the taste of seaside toffee and smoke add a massive dose of delicious and you have it the 10yo is good this is different gravy  this is the best whisky i have ever tasted and that is far too many the combination of oak smoke and sweetness is just astonishing the bouquet is an enticing hint of what is to come but the flavour whilst quite peaty is just fill of toffee its smooth deep complex and dangerously moorish  given that usually i can buy the talisker 10 locally for 163 30 i have to ask is this 18yo worth the extra 163 46 and the answer is yes and no i certainly prefer it to the 10yo it 39 s got a bit more of everything the peat the smoke the pepper fruit and oak but more rounded and balanced and without the sourness in the finish which doesn 39 t agree with me however i was reading recently in charles maclean 39 s book 39 spirit of place 39 that the vast majority of the spirit distilled at carbost is tankered down to the central belt to be casked and stored before being chill filtered and colour added compare that to the 163 63 springbank 15 which is produced entirely in campbeltown start to finish and bottled at 46 non chillfilered with no artificial colouring so did i enjoy my drams of talisker 18 yes i did but when my springbank and talisker bottles are empty guess which one i 39 ll be replacing  i clearly had a different experience than others here i tried this tonight for the first time and was actually quite disappointed i found it to be primarily malt forward with any notes of peat or oak influence nearly completely muted it felt flat i expected more depth from an 18 year especially from talisker this may be due to me trying it at an establishment that i got the impression doesn 39 t move it frequently so perhaps it has oxidised a bit or maybe i 39 m just searching for a reason either way i expected more i 39 ll try it again at a more trusted establishment but until i revisit this whiskey my assessment will remain  brilliant the only reason i don 39 t give this 5 is because the f19 distiller 39 s edition aged in amoroso sherry casks probably outdoes this believe it or not but this is a glorious balance between island type flavors of peat and smoke and highland type flavors of honey and toffee great whisky the talisker 18 is to the 10 year old like beethoven is to john phillip sousa it is the goldilocks of whiskeys perfectly balanced savory the perfect blend of spice smokiness pepper and floral it along with highland park 18 spoils you into scotch dreamland caressing you and making the hundred and a half you spill from your pocket seem like a pittence  i really wanted to love this but the fact is i like the 10 year and nas storm much better the 18 year has a medicinal or iodine finish and the brash smokiness of the 10 year and storm is too subdued in the 18 save your money and get the 10 year  one of my favourite whiskies and lives up to the hype has all the right balance of sweetness smokiness complexity and length probably shouldn 39 t be surprised that it 39 s becoming increasingly hard to come by hopefully just a temporary shortage rather than a discontinued line  it 39 s awful can people please stop buying it  this is a really lovely whisky which surges in the mouth and is beautifully balanced in flavour it packs a good kick but in a sweet and really pleasurable way my partner who i share whisky notes with agreed it is a very enjoyable malt whisky  i really like the 10 yo and dislike the talisker skye the 18 is just wonderful  very very excellent  totally agree with 39 flavour explosion 39 amazing dram this one totally delicious in every way never disappoints 128526  in rating any whisky there is an immense subjective factor we all have different tastes those of you like me that thoroughly enjoy oban 18 highland park 18 macallan 18 and bunnahabhain 18 and glenmorangie signet there is a new contender in town having been at the distillery in 2017 and tasted the distiller 39 s edition skye and 57 deg i was aware that i enjoyed their flavor profile but nothing prepared me for the exquisite taste of the 18 the experience begins in the proper glencairn glass the color is a deep amber which seems to coat the sides of the glass the nose is splendid and it is a portend of what is to come the first sip is a flavor explosion which overwhelms the senses the usual hints of peat are expertly blended into a masterful concerto of other incredibly satisfying flavors black cherry salted caramel and plums are discernible but muted some citrus emerges but unlike glenmorangie it is not the overriding flavor by the second sip the reinforcements arrive with even more elements of this indelible expression taking time between sips allows for the lingering and more subtle flavors of spices to emerge finishing this whisky will leave you almost exhausted and exhilarated and comforted by the fact that you have the rest of the bottle to enjoy i will enjoy all my other usuals but talisker 18 has blasted its way to the front of the line i now need to taste the 25 keep tuned in  fabulous bottling one definately to savor the classic talisker profile is there although subdued as you would expect yummy worth the asking price  as we are visiting scotland talisker could be tried 128514 128514 128514  i love whisky i love laphroig lagavulin glenfarclas kilchoman and many more but talisker 18 is what i had always imagined the perfect whisky to be every whisky lover should get to try this at least once delicious manages to be smoky sweet and spicy all at once more subtle than laga 16 very good dram this one voted quot best whisky int world quot in 2007 overall just superb  one of my favorites smoke and spice with a touch of sweetness would love to try a cask strength  my favourite peated whisky smoke doesn 39 t overpower a beautiful whisky full of complexity deliciously oily palate  i tried many whiskies but talisker 18 is arguably one of the best whisky ever made  my family favorite when will it come again  excellent dram more smoke than peat unlike ardberg or lagavulan several flavors including some sea salt brine and what a long finish i got it for 80 in the states and worth every penny and then some  talisker 18 year old on the nose immediately recognisable talisker some pepper colour amber the taste and the true body of this drink comes in waves three or four in conjunctive after that the peppery finish draws in slowly but steady prevailing on the lateral parts of the tongue it leaves the drinker in respectful awe talisker 10 is maybe just staring at the sea but this product is the sea itself splashing on the rugged face of a fisherman  sensational this is the scotch my father would drink if i shared it warms my heart and makes my think of a seaside castle oh and hang on because the flavor evolves for some time the folks that created this highland vacation in a bottle have earned my respect  every winter solstice the mariners hockey club gathers on the end of the warrnambool breakwater to pay homage the mariners who have lost their lives at sea warren day a legend of the club would read poetry in his booming voice take his 18 year old talisker and brazenly hold it to the stormy sky to toast the seafaring ghosts and warm the cockles of his heart this is a legendary whisky a legendary taste for legendary men  couldn 39 t find a better balanced peated whisky if you tried well spiced ginger well salted sea salt brine and the slightest touch of sweetness too salted toffee i recently featured this whisky for a tasting and it didn 39 t last long at all  bought at talisker my 18 year old is gone fruits oak und at least i can smell the salt of the sea the wind does his work at the warehouse so you to buy the next ones enjoy this is worse than 10yo storm or dare i say it skye unpleasant aftertaste and nothing much to offer on the palate i will definitely not buy this ever again  immense and rich fruits oak and peat perfectly balanced pleasant and long can 39 t get enough  tried this at the distillary last week grabbed a bottle and run straight to the till beautiful whisky  i deleted some of my best work last night unrecoverable i used this to toast the fallen soldier it was excellent katie best i 39 ve had this scotch is bomb  this is how a whisky should be it takes a man to drink it sorry ladies if you love it too call me you may be my kind of girl it is earthy smokey sour and smouldering like a destroyed village on an eastern island after a raiding party ardbeg and laphroiag may be smokier but they assault your senses toast peaches black pepper nutmeg aaaah i could go on all night this is the best whisky money can buy  wonderful refreshing whisky with a lovely warm spicy finish  i don 39 t drink it i buy it for my son  very good although i tasted one of these a couple of years ago and that one was legendary good not sure which year that one was from though joakim fabulous mouth feel really chewy in a good way peppery and floral with a long lingering sunset of pepper vanilla ginger and liquorice i hope my friends never spot it at the back of the cabinet  i recently received this bottle as a gift i had just seen ralfy 39 s recent review praising this expression so i was thrilled to try it let me tell you i can 39 t imagine a better expression of a talisker than this if you are a fan on the talisker 10 year old i assure you that you will be blown away by this bottle it 39 s basically everything the 10 year old is trying to be perfected while it 39 s very pricey near me it 39 s worth it for the odd special occasion 95 100 stuff and a must try for any talisker fan  this 18yr old has a fair hint of iodine and a light smokiness that does not hinder the palate when explorer the butter caramel notes enjoyable to say the least and has me interested in trying other drams within the same age bracket a nice teenage bottle that definitely makes me want to expand my horizon with the 25yr old 2005 which i have waiting for me cheers  rich viscous fruity spicy and then peppery a great value for a high scoring 18 year old  if you re read the review it says the lagavulin was disappointing compared to other islays meaning that there are other islays that they enjoy amp that this t18 was was disappointing as was the lag to their taste amp not that the t18 was an islay as was the lag it was the disappointment that was compared  this is not an islay malt  i m comparing this to the lagavulin 16 which was disappointing to my tastes compared to other islays and this was similar but even less interesting sorry  a very fine whiskey to be sure all the flavour of the 10yr old with a nice mellowness it s a little overpriced compared to say the lagavulin 16 and even the excellent talisker 10 though  one of the best whisky i ve ever tasted and i ve tried a few  truly sensational like a boat that wasn t there a second ago  gotta get myself one of these talisker is fantastic one of the few to compete with islay offerings i have the 10 and a 20cl bottle of this 18 give the 18 time and space a tiny drop of water and it will explode beautiful  this is one of the best whiskies around more austere and less aggressive than the 10 year old all the typical talisker flavours are there in a subtler whole a truly great dram  to the gents who complained of the medicinal i have noticed a peculiarity of the t18 which upon receipt i was somewhat disappointed i have noticed that it takes a good 15 20 minutes to open up and it is easy to tell when the strong iodine smell has dissipated there should be left just a moderate sweet smell which is exactly the palate you should experience ok that is my two cents and maybe will allow you to enjoy your bottle of t18 as much as i am enjoying mine which is substantially  i love it one word smoooth and long lasting on your palletthe problem i cant get it it canada tooooo baaad the best whisky i ve tasted just perfectly balanced with sweet salt and peat flavours and a lovely long finish a few of us did a blind test on a few whiskies and this was everyone s favourite now to save up for a whole bottle can t wait  i m a big fan of the 10 year old but the 18 year old has a more mellow taste as is now my favourite malt  i think the description of medicinal was brilliant but to me it just didn t develop much from there maybe i m a harsh critic but i just expect a bit more from an 18 year old  having just returned from a trip to skye and being unable to purhase a bottle of the 18 at the distillery yes you read correctly i managed to get a bottle of it in a delicattessen in the byres road in glasgow being a massive fan of islay malts and all of the islands malts i really do like this 18 year old it seems slightly more subtle than the excellent 10 and for me seems to have a slightly more complex nose and finish i can understand why talisker 18 has won awards its beatiful  i have to agree mbw it s slightly medicinal on the nose get past that to really knock your socks off the talisker 18 y o imho is one of the best drams you can buy for less than 100 sitting here in the far and rather cold bit of northern canada was with great pleasure a bottle of said t arived must have been away too long as first impresion was of tcp sorry nanny but upto temp and away with all that god created a walk though the woods on an crisp novenber day were my thoughts this is really a seriously good way to enjoy an evening far better than most hate to bring the value for money thing up but my humble opinion rather 1 bottle of this than several bottles of for eg glen so final score tal 18yo 8 glen etc 3 try 1 and enjoyregads mbw
101625.0, quite rich sweet and fruity definitely benefitting from the sherry casks with a hint of smokiness easy to drink absolutely fantastic value my first taste and what a wonderful surprise absolutely delicious
1850.0, one of the great sherry cask whiskies all bottles from first fill sherry casks that spend their entire life just maturing in sherry casks like the good old macallan 10 and 12 year olds from yesteryear an amazing whisky from the other great distillery in pitlochry very surprised it isn t more well known  not a bad whisky but overpriced in my opinion when you consider glenallachie 12 deanston 12 and glen garioch 12 are all far superior and all cheaper this 1 at 163 48 is not an attractive option i 39 m afraid 163 35 would be a fair price point for this bottle there 39 s no way it 39 s an almost 50 qid bottle not 1 i 39 ll buy again  this was a very pleasant surprise it is a nice whisky going in but the after taste just grows and grows making it an exceptional whisky  finest whisky i 39 ve ever tasted in 55 years of trying all kinds must only be drunk with highland spring water  100 quality great taste 100 value i bought a bottle of this for a tasting session last christmas and thought it was a really really top notch dram highly recommended sweet and mild not overwhelming at all a very easy whisky to drink  i opened my bottle of this on the occasion for the birth of my granddaughter recently it was an excellent choice very smooth easy to drink i confess i had a difficult time with getting the nose on it i definitely did not pick up any peatiness the finish was smooth and lingered but not for too long this is a whisky i could enjoy again and again sadly like one of the other reviewer s i to live in the states and my access to uk exclusive whiskies has been curtailed because of covid very nice whiskey in fact the best i ve ever tasted sadly i had only purchased 2 bottles when i visited house oj bruar this past december i live in the usa and can t buy any more at this time i truly wish you could help me with this problem  i always said life s too short to drink the same whisky twice well i was wrong  not too dissimilar to although more subtle balanced than the glenfarclas 15 which is a favourite of mine have had both back to back and the blair athol 12 feels better balanced against the glenfarclas bolder flavour there 39 s a hint of sherried notes and a very very slight oily texture but really subtle enjoyable and recommended  when drunk out of a decent glass i 39 d agree with the above i got a hint of banana on the finish on my last sip and a slight hint of the mouth puckering effect of citrus i think i was allowing it to coat my tongue and the roof of my mouth a little more by this point  great value for money lovely smooth whiskey  great stuff well balanced with nothing dominating or sitting back good sherry character but never too heavy complex enough for the discerning drinker yet accessible to all wouldn 39 t mind a slightly higher abv but it 39 s still very good and highly recommended so that shouldn 39 t put you off a very whisky like whisky if that makes sense  this is an exceptional whisky forget about how cheap it is this is hands down the best whisky i have ever had the complexity of flavour is incredible and that finish wow  i am partial to irish whiskeys such as green yellow spot and redbreast this whisky is on a par but less sweet which is actually a good thing it is very interesting and absolutely gorgeous following a spicy meal for the price it is superb do not hesitate to buy  just a yummy sweet warm taste sensation loved every dram delicious one of my faves  liquid gold with caramel toffee and malt on the tongue i also found no trace of smoke which pleased me too great for before or after dinner  sherry and nice  i had actually always hated scotch then we tried blair athol flora and fauna at the distillery while in scotland and i was converted it is phenomenal i wish it were available somewhere closer to me  one of my favorites sweet malty good body great mouth feel can 39 t be beat for twice the price i found no smokieness whatever which i very much prefer  both my partner and i were most pleasantly surprised by this malt whisky beautifully balanced drinkable and smooth i 39 d compare it to dalwhinnie or oban for smoothness and drinkability a pleasure and delight  with one word perfect  the blair athol must be one of the best kept secrets amongst malt whisky drinkers it 39 s one you must try before you die  if you like your sherried malts this is an absolute must i toyed with the idea of buying a bottle for the last few years after glowing review after glowing review i decided to purchase a bottle wow so glad i did fantastic whisky what are you waiting for  i 39 ve tried many reputable whiskies now after several years and one of the most exciting things for me is to buy a new bottle with the hope that it 39 s going to be the best i 39 ve ever had my favourite up until now was the powers john 39 s lane 12 with ardbeg 10 being a close contender well that ends today my new favorite is this little beauty the blair athol 12 nose nuts toffee raisins sherry a hint of leather tobaccopalate dark chocolate raisins tobacco leather an almost dusty quality to it and a hint of roasted coffeefinish this is the most surprising of all it lingers for quite a long time with a sudden and unexpected burst of sweetness from the toffee over and over with every swallow it seems to get sweeter and sweeter with the soft lingering taste of chocolate coffee and the ever present tobaccotruly sublime one of the best 9 2 10 purchased the small sampler which disappeared very quickly wished i bought the full size loved loved the sherry cask and smooth syrupy finish nose fresh and dried fruit touch of leather tobacco sherry with a hint of sulphur taste smooth full bodied sweet tobacco and a hint of sherry sweetness it 39 s ok but if you 39 re sensetive to sulphur it 39 s not gonna tick all the boxes  i bought a 200ml bottle at the distillery in pitlochry last week wish i had gone for the full bottle instead i actually bought 3 bottles and now wish i hadn 39 t given the other 2 away as presents  this is absolutely a 5 star expression in my opinion from a distillery that routinely produces outstanding whiskies and at a price that is rather remarkable considering the depth of character and palate of flavors those flavors come at you subtly from front palate to well past the back palate i get the expected caramel but in an unexpected density that is somehow backed up by subtle fruit citrus to my taste buds but subtle and the if you really take you time and let the whisky flow across the back of your tongue you 39 ll detect a subtle fleeting peatiness that does nothing but add intrigue and then is gently buried by sherried orange and a touch more caramel with hints of vanilla this might be the best sub 60 whiskey i 39 ve ever enjoyed  if the taste of the wild hedgerow could be bottled then blair athol is it hints of wild black berries and wild black currants are there for the taking with a mellow peat back ground it 39 s all there there is no roughness in it 39 s perfection of flavor which will leave you wanting more and even if its been some years since your last drop the memory of it 39 s taste is an overwhelming thing that makes you want to come back for more upon first tasting this dram i am struck with the sweat malt and the almost caramel syrup followed by a smooth sweet finish that dries and it far more complex than most 12yo this expression is a great deal at this price and i strong recommend two bottles one to drink and one to keep as a back up gift for any new scotch drinker  sweet and smooth with subtle peat this 12 year old punches way over its age blair athol has become my go to 12 year old and is it a great way to introduce friends to scotch whisky without breaking the bank i am a glendronach man given my druthers but for the daily finger or two ba is in the front of the cabinet  just try it the subtle peat dry orange notes with gentle sherry notes makes this whisky a great one the finish is a tad short to my liking but a great whisky for a 12 year old fine and smooth this will make it for the evening when you are in no hurry and want to spend a good 2 hrs with a malt as a companion dont rush through  outstanding extremely smooth malt i 39 m annoyed i only bought one bottle  great malt good i have been drinking single malt now for 4 decades and have been delighted by the quality and variety of flavours i have many favourites but if pressed really hard i would have to say that blair atholl has become my favourite in the last 2 years has everything delicacy depth flavour aromatic and earthy genius  really good one hi there could you please send an email to our purchasing team purchasing masterofmalt com with all that information they will get back to you as soon as possible the chaps at master of malt cask no 50729 or s0729 700ml 43 vol 70cl 12 year old single malt bought in 1994 and in a wooden presentation box has a mellow deep toned aroma a strong fruity flavour and smooth finish  great achievement good cigar in a dram at the beginning fresh sherry tobacco leaves then satysfying palate on spicy burnt cigar nice aftertaste on orangy cigarettes 9

34797.0, very rich flavour which tastes so good this one is one of my all time favourites 128076  smooth sweet beautiful whiskey the port wood finish highly recommended sublime nose very fruity then when nipping you taste a predominant spiciness that puts all other flavors far into the background that 39 s a pity disappointing finish for me it deserves only 3 stars just for the nose then  wonderfully fruity and rich i always loved the discontinued 12 year old quinta ruban by glenmorangie but felt their 14 year old replacement was inferior this is an excellent alternative damn fine dram end of  highly rated 14yo single malt whisky tawny port finish is not over powering but compliments really well  a very good and tasty whisky one of the best i 39 ve had this year well worth a try cheers great whisky good taste smooth l could drink this all day would buy again first bottle bought at the distilery was amazing second bottle bought on this very website was less than convincing shame it was lovely the first time  finest malt tested this for the first time at loch ness and was wonderfully surprised by the texture and depth tried a sample box of five other tomatin including the 36 year old and this remains far and away my favourite found a supplier in sydney and have ordered a bottle will test it on my father in law a wiley scot with a lifetime of whiskey appreciation if he guesses the vintage finish and distillery he gets the bottle  have been looking for a portwood finish for a long time and finally found one which is bang on the money thoroughly enjoying every drop of it  one of the best whiskies from a very good distillery lovely on the nose and the port kicks in straight away buy not over powering at all some hints of marmalade and sweetness after  excellent whisky and great value for money very rich nose see and palate love it maple syrup nose almost overpowering and rosewater in the mouth its bourbon rich sweet and yes there is a tawny port thing going on no red fruits at all to be honest this does not taste like any other whisky its mostly cask influences i can see why some folk like it but well it 39 s just not whisky jim  was aged 20 months in tawny port casks not ruby so any reference to red fruits or quinta ruban is imaginary except for the slight pinkish tinge before that bourbon which is the main cask influence and very noticable in a good way otherwise it 39 s rather hard to pin down but a tad sour yes it 39 s ok for a friday evening a solid 3 stars overall i would not buy again i really admire the integrity of non chill non colour 46 but it 39 s not that special to be honest the west cork 12yo port cask 163 38 is better  smooth rich flavour from the port wood casks compares very well to the glenmorangie quinta ruban excellent  agree with the tasting notes of mom finish is very sweet and port like can see why this mingles well with japanese taste  non chill filtered natural color 46 abv awesome i was a big fan of glenmorangie quinta ruban and very eager to try other port cask aged whisky and this is honestly much better this is honestly even better than a lot of sherried stuff i have tried over the years has a beautiful color to it very unique almost pink actually smells like so much berries with raisins and plums tastes of chocolate dipped strawberries as well as the above mentioned fruits with some vanilla and marzipan this is just downright sexy and to think it took me up until about a year ago to try the 12 year which is also excellent just because the name was too close to tomato haha what a fool i was this is absolutely delicious one of the tastiest drams i have had in a while buy it if you can cheers the sugarbear iv been a big fan of single malt all my life and i must say that in my opinion this roma ton 14 yo simply blows away the mass majority of its competitors sampled this in the advent calendar day 12 and my favourite so far light sweetness and very easy to drink  nice rich layers of flavor with fruit spice and a little nutty i 39 m a fan of port and this is one of the better more complex port wood finish drams tried and picked up a bottle of this from the scotch experience in edinburgh then visited the distillery in tomatin and picked up a different bottle i would have to say this is the best scotch i ve ever had so glad i can still get this while back home  n dried red fruit oak strawberry honey honeycomb lemon nutty and melon tones p it s oh so velvety smooth and sweet rich red fruit oak chocolate dried fruit coffee fresh chocolate muffin great mouth feel f it s got a long finish slight dryness masses of rich red fruit chocolate hazelnut oak coffee it s a really long finish orange peel more chocolate muffin it s still going slight mint and melon rolls around with that dried fruit c i love this whiskywings a lovely fruity dessert dram strong up front and long in the back fruity a bit of mellow spice vanilla perhaps and a warming finish  tried this at the distillery surprised at the initial nose of oak and vanilla which gave way to christmas cake on the palate the finish was of good length and warming good example of a port wood finish  very interesting dram at a great price very happy to have this in my collection adds great contrast to most drams  powerful nose yet suprisingly smooth deeply satisfying like a log fire on a stormy evening  this was simply beautiful on the nose rich on the palate and the finish is long silky and satisfying i usually struggle with port wood finishes and rarely come across any i truly enjoy this is the exception strongly recommend good bang for the buck whisky lassie
2627.0, tomintoul have a vast range of whiskies now and its not called the gentle dram for nothing but this 16 is head and shoulders above the rest good but not particularly exciting quite thin even but a great start for someone new to whisky or enjoys a milder flavour it is smooth and a great aperitif pretty good value at under 163 42  one of my favorites no peat and easy gentle taste if you 39 re looking for a reasonably aged smooth and mellow speyside dram at a very reasonable price then this may well be for you ok it 39 s not prefect it 39 s only 40 is chillfiltered and is not natural colour but it does go down well and taste good it 39 s not my usual type of dram but i have to admit that i did enjoy it  this has been my go to scotch for several years a consistent almond finish almost sherryish sadly it is becoming very difficult to find in the u s this may finally nudge us into a distillery visit we think it is underrated and undervalued in scotch circles deserving of the highest praise  i discovered the tomintoul range a few years back the 16yr old is lovely dram easy to take and one that i find fabulous value for money i 39 ve had more expensive whisky that is nowhere near as drinkable as this  just had my first dram easy on the palate doesn 39 t overwhelm and very enjoyable smooth vanilla with a late spring taste about to have a second to flush out some of the other notes medium finish  wish i could get this 16 year old delicious smooth whisky in cambridge ontario not available at lcbo and you don 39 t ship here sadly  having tried dozens of different single malts over the years with a taste that runs heavily toward the speysides i must say that this is a beautiful whiskey which can be enjoyed at a price that doesn t put it out of reach for the average drinker in fact if i could only buy one single malt the rest of my life as opposed to some fantasy of being given anything out there this would be the one  i m only disappointed that since my introduction some 10 years ago i ve had difficulty finding it keeping it and giving it up i prefer it over my 300 and even a more recent much higher price bottle always keep one in the cellar  it s excellent very smooth very similar to glenlevet as for the 26 year olds comment what you know at 26 you can put in an ants asshole and have room left over excellent single malt scotch  absolutely amazing if you like oban 14 then is even better much better than many others at much higher prices cant say enough about the 16 i may try others but i will never be out of tomintoul 16 my brother gifted me a bottle and changed what i drink forever i was content with a rather good blended scotch until the fateful night when we shared a dram of tomintoul 16 that he had just given me i cherish my brother and this whiskey  if you are looking for a smooth slightly sweet aromatic whisky then this is your best bet for the price honestly this cannot be beat i 39 m a big fan of oban 14 and anything ardbeg to give you an idea of general taste but when i want something smooth i go for tomintoul 16 anyone saying this is a 1 star whisky either got one bad bottle or has exceptionally poor taste  light bright easy to drink and with no off flavours this is a nice dram to share with people who haven 39 t developed a more sophisticated whisky palette i believe it would make a great base for a blended whisky but it lacks the distinctive character to be a truly memorable single malt not sure i 39 d buy it again but i did quite enjoy it while i had it and went through it rather quickly as it 39 s such a pleasant and palatable drink  lovely 16 silky smooth all on its lonesome leave the water in the tap amp enjoy  complex opens up on adding little water shows some fruits amp medium body pleasant fruity not honeyed but very subtle at back of palate the range of this malt just goes from great to fabulousi was lucky quite a few years ago to have the enormous pleasure of tasting a 25 year old and will never forget the fabulous taste unfortunately being an oap probably will never get that chance again a malt among malts with a taste of the heavens  i agree with dust comments a crap 16 y o malt i never have been much of a scotch drinker i didn 39 t like the peaty aftertaste but this scotch is really good goes down smooth and has a nice finish  about ten years ago i was visiting speyside and came across one small brewary and it was tomitoul i visited the brewary and tasted 16 years old tomintoul i found it very tasting and very smooth going through the throat very nicely i think it s a rolls royce of whiskeys since then i am only drinking tomitoul the worst 16 i ever tasted anonimous  tried the 10 year old when last i was in moray liked it and wanted to buy another baxters only had the 16yo so got that instead absolutely delicious not heavy sweet and rolls around the mouth beautifully the previous reviewer must have had a curry for his birthday meal  i was given a bottle for my 26th birthday i am a massive fan of spey whiskeys single malts and have been for years in my opinion as this is a review and i am being honest this is by far one of the worst from the spey area to me it was sour with an off flavour that i can only describe as fishy everyone i have shared it with also tells me there is something off about it and rejected when i offered them more i would seriously question the recommendations of anyone who enjoys this whiskey be warned  lovely and smooth leaves the mouth tasting like honey  apple cider review you have no fuckin clue i have been a heavy drinker of whisky all my life and this dram is amoungst the best crawl back under your stone you pathetic excuse for an ape  first time to taste very smooth and god taste i did like my friends too opened up nicely in the glass  exp 233 dition rapide et tr 232 s soign 233 e excellent suivi du colis je recommande  this is most certainly a wonderful scotch for the price it was 60 in upstate ny got home sat down after dinner with a bit in a glass and it didnt have a bit some fruity and earthy undertones and a semi sweet aroma i certainly will keep on hand  it 39 s good nothing more than that i did not find this to be exciting but i did like it for the price it would make a good everyday whisky  at under 52 75l you can t go wrong with this flavour the dude dette who posted quot apple cider quot quot review quot below must have drunk vinegar or s he has no clue  after playing the pipes we pass around the flasks the tomintoul wins every time it is very smooth has almost no bite and the most wonderful follow up it is worth every penny and will always be my drink of choice  this is truly one of the worst scotches i have bought in years abominable sour surly and not even close to being a quot gentle dram quot unless you like sucking on rotten apples and spitting out the foetid seeds in your glencairn glass  very smooth first place for sure  in un mio viaggio a londra ebbi modo di assaggiare e quindi acquistare questo whisky che reputo molto buono nel sapore successivamente ho continuato ad acquistare tramite amici che si recavano a londra ora per 242 vedo che c 232 la possibilit 224 di ordinarlo via internet e questo sar 224 per me un servizio che non tralascer 242 di utilizzare grazie e complimenti the tomintoul 16 is great value for money i don t think any other 16 year old whiskies are available at this great price upon tasting it i could see why they call it the gentle dram lots of subtle fruit flavours but by no means uninteresting a very pleasant unassuming malt 
2001.0, five stars
71920.0, an unpleaseant splash of fuel oil with a biting assault of javex thrown in and a panicky lingering after taste of being poisoned what the hell was sure something was wrong with it especially with the milky white toxic appearance was heading straight back to lcbo with 39 defective product 39 until reading other reviews i 39 m a seasoned scotch taster with lagavulin 16 one of my favourites so don 39 t tell me i don 39 t get it admittedly i don 39 t understand though  this is great sweet sour ashy and a bit oaky too that s what i get at least oh and that burned top of a creme brullee don t compare this to the 16 please it s something else for someone else i compared it to ardbeg wee beastie which is more earthy and would say the l is a tiny bit more my cuppa than the a and this comes from an ardbeg fanboy ziveli  this 200th anniversary 8yr old was described as 39 exceptionally fine 39 and i can confirm that to be true far more rich than the 16yr much more peat and smoke which lingers in your mouth for ages afterwards add a couple drops of water and it instantly becomes more sweet while opening the dram up nicely this is a brilliant expression of lagavulin and i would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys peated whisky would i buy another bottle absolutely  this could be the worst whisky i 39 ve ever tasted 48 so i tried adding a drop of water did not help atrocious stuff and not cheap either i could have got laphroaig 10yr for 20 less  very nice takes a few sips or maybe glasses to understand  very disappointed the flavor was way too light lacking body to me it was not much better than a cheap watered down whisky no where near qualified to even hold the title of of an islay let alone the famed lagavulin label i 39 m mixing the rest of the bottle to my everyday blended scotch either that or throw it away  a novice lagavulin drinker with only the 16 to compare the 8 is lovely mixed with coconut water and a couple of ice cubes the 16 is excellent straight again beginner scotch drinker just fortunate to have had the 16 as my first taste of this beautiful spirit  don 39 t go comparing this to lagavulin 16 it 39 s a different beast altogether being much closer to ardbeg 10 light smooth and smoky with a finish that lingers long after the last drop a great discovery  compared to the 16 it 39 s like it isn 39 t lagavulin at all i did not care for it i 39 ll drink it but wishing i was drinking the 16  sorry to all lagavulin fan boys which i am too but what the hell is this when i bought the bottle couple month ago i was so desapointed instinctively you compare it to the 16yo and you should not it is a totally different taste profile i thought i juste had to leave it a few month and try it again i still cannot drink this it is all about peat and strong alcohol and i do not understand the interst of drinking this quot thing quot anyway being now more objectiv it is from my point of view very similar to the kilchomann machir bay peatier for sure with less depth and more bitterness the worst part of all of this i still ask myself if my bottle has an quot issue quot or if it is just no my cup of tea and that 39 s all end of story  such a shock when the pale colour hit my snifter wasn 39 t sure what i had re read all the tasting notes on the side of the box truthfully it took three nosings and palatings before i felt i had a lagavulin in my hand i will continue the lessons  a bit quot rough around the edges quot compared to the 16 but a cracking malt nonetheless not as deep as the 16 year old but still plenty of peat try it in a hot chocolate and it is phenomenal  peaty for sure spicy finish  this was my first time trying any of the varieties from lagavulin never again this scotch was by far the worst tasting spirit i have ever tried i honestly felt bad for my garbage disposal when i poured an entire bottle down the drain  first dram out of the bottle felt peaty and bold but then the magic went off the more i drank the more it felt young and immature i let the bottle to settle up for a month hopping it will come to its senses but it didn t the smoke became less noticeable highlighting the spirit immaturity even more it priced very aggressively here in canada way over the usual suspects while losing to them in every possible category  i am so happy with this scotch outstanding blend of smoke and spicy fruit the color is intriguing and sparkles in the sunlight i love the nose as it evolves with time in the glass a splash of warm water opens up some citrus notes and some brine this will be on my scotch shelf at all times with a name like locklin alexander mc donald i have tried many fine whiskies and this is one  awful never again after the first glass i got rid of the bottle  not the biggest lagavulin fan to begin with but i really like this one love the natural colour very nice compared to the 16 year old lots of smoke but fresh and fragrant reminds me in style of ardbeg 10 and port charlotte 10 rather than laphroaig or even lagavulin 16 surprisingly sweet and complex enough to keep me interested will buy again no doubt  delicious smoke from nose to finish slightly sour arrival with undertones of fresh floral sweetness the abv gives this whisky a good depth and breath of flavour very nice dram if not a little bit expensive  this is non chill filtered and bottled at a proper strength the 16 is great but it 39 s like listening to music that 39 s been very heavily produced and edited the 8 year old is a live performance and that authenticity is delicious  very honestly the only note i get is that of industrial methylated spirit i really question whoever wrote the notes on nose palate and finish this bottle was bought for me by by son at the singapore airport before christmas and it is undrinkable even when diluted i have been a connoisseur of fine scotch sine the mid seventies and have tasted nothing like this i mean as horrible as this  people are commenting on the price tag in new hampshire the 8 year old is 52 dollars and the 16 is 70 same as the lagavulin 16 but a much less refined finish i don t know where some reviews here found the 8 to be more expensive than the 16 that s based on your liquor store and not this whiskey for a younger and 20 dollar cheaper whiskey the 8 is a fine offering  really enjoy the combination of soft peat and milk chocolate if you like milk chocolate and less peat just try it  i was extremely disappointed i enjoy several single malt scotch brands and decided to try the laguvulin 8 year old the peat smell was prominent but the color was almost totally clear and it tasted like paint thinner this is the first and only negative review i 39 ve ever submitted for a single malt scotch i would have thought that sacrilege until i tasted the lagaluvin 8  excellent scotch bar none if your a peaty guy  this is not a bady single malt its definitely drinkable it definitely has peat however in no way is this anywhere near lagavulin 16 and in no way does it deserve that price tag i have no idea what the people were smoking that give it a 4 or 5 star rating  here in bc canada the 8 is 79 99 and the 16 is 139 99 and i 39 m so happy that i actually like the 8 better 48 abv and lots of peat amazing whisky  after reading these reviewed on the 8 will buy next time to try got to favorite store 10 min before closing saw this on shelf for first time now i had to choose btw three highland park 12 talisker 10 and curve ball lagavulin 8 picked up the lag then put back for the talisker all same price point will be more brave and try this lag 8 next time  this is my favourite islay whisky at the moment i actually prefer it to its 16 year old brother the flavour is more intense because of the higher abv and the distillery character from those wonderful lagavulin pot stills is more clearly defined because of its youth instead of the leather and pipe smoke notes of the 16 year old you get disinfectant and kerosene as well as more fresh lemon and green peppercorns the brine and iodine are still there this runs rings around ardbeg 10 and laphroaig 10 kudos to diageo for bottling this at 48 abv putting an age statement on it and not adding too much colouring  very very good for the price i drink laphroaig 10 amp ardbeg 10 all the time this is around the same price point also peaty amp smokey but very distinct amp lagavulin richer amp creamier than ardbeg sweeter than laphroaig  wow i m a huge fan of the 16 but this one is even better imo still very much lagavulin but brighter and sweeter with the most amazing bubblegum candy note i absolutelu love it  tried this side by side with the ardbeg 10 and it was a little embarrassing for lagavulin i can 39 t help feeling they rushed this out to add to their range it is not bad but not particularly amazing either certainly not an islay classic  exceptional  kinda tastes like strong peat and cheap spirits tastes like it say outside in a cedar forest with the cap off then someone added rubbing alcohol the reviewer just below me makes a great point i happen to love this i m not a fan of the 16 i also love ardbeg 10 all styles of whisky are not for all people if you don t like a particular style it doesn t make it bad it s just not for you if you re new to whisky my advice as as an experienced whisky drinker is to try as many different whiskies in as many different styles as you can the make up your own mind  this lagavulin really splits opinion forget comparing it with the 16 year old it s an entirely different beast this is young and fiery islay whisky in my opinion the way islay whisky is best enjoyed if you love ardbeg 10 laphroaig 10 you will love this if you prefer your islay more mature and subdued this one isn t for you the negative reviews do make me laugh clearly missing the point style of this bottle  i am real big fan of lagavulin but this one nope i may have a bad bottle i actually hope so cause it tastes like a mix between strong liquid herbal peat and cheap alcohol almost undrinkable i have about 30 peated whisky on my shelf and never had anything that bad before i must try another one  very good job lagavulin i think the smell is significant lighter than the 16 is it lagavulin its not as deep and chunky with the punch i know but this 8 has an expectation in it some vanilla a clean start youngness you can see the whitenes in her colores and with the extra help with higher alcohol level it helps her to bring life and awakens the lagavulin hearity she comes from she becomes smooth long and beautiful if you want to age her in the cellar go for it but she wants to get out now i want more  this is unmistakably a lagavulin offering but seems to be their own unique take on ardbeg 10 intentionally or not if you 39 re a fan of lagavulin and a fan of ardbeg this will amaze and delight you i still think lagavulin 16 is the most perfect substance ever created by man but i happily drink this 8 year old often  what a surprise i hope i never run out  it tastes absolutely disgusting very disappointed all l can taste is tcp yes tcp the antiseptic  totally agree with quot ardbeg 10 ish quot comment i feel exactly the same about it fortunatly it is more complex and the peat do not takes over to much despite everything i do prefer the 16 yo version   for making this a permanent fixture in your range my favorite laggy different from the 16 year old but with the familiar hint of peat and smokey sweetness in the laggy tradition  very nice for a 8 yo peaty dusty smoke citrusy salty fruitiness gets smoother and sweeter with water decently long finish pretty similar to ardberg 10 if not as intense enough complexity and balance me likes a lot  i tried both 16 yrs and 8 yrs old variant of lagavulin in my humble opinion this one has richer taste that every true whiskey lover will appreciate  slept through this one ddn 39 t know it existed locals weren 39 t handling it enough got a bottle for a gift happy birthday happy days delicious not the 16yr but excellent 16 yr costs 92 00 a bottle this was 58 00ish could replace laphroig as my go to everyday dram  don t listen to the lagavulin 16 fan boys this is an absolutely must for true islay fans love the nose reminiscent for a fine mescal palate damp ash with fruity citrus overtones truly epic finish medium length honestly this stuff is the epitome of what an islay whisky should be completely different to the 16 however that s a good thing 10 10 for 163 50 my new go to staple islay this and ardbeg 10 and laphroaig qc  is this price a joke this was the price when the bottling was limited it 39 s now a permanent expression and although it 39 s spent half the time in cask it 39 s more expensive than the 16 hmmm a delicious lagavulin a younger spirit at almost cask strength upon popping the cork you know it is the younger sister of the classic 16 fresh fruity notes with the familiar islay smoke and all the fixings in this mouth watering youthful spirit bravo lagavulin  lagavulin 16 is one of my go to whiskies when i first tried the 8 i had low expectations but what a surprise the second time i hosted a tasting with 2 of my whisky loving friends we tasted the 8 12 and 16 all three of us gave the 8 the highest score filled by the 16 
79678.0, smooth creamy with an almost brandy finish easy to drink and moreish not great few 12yo are great but certainly ok for the price  i remember liking op12 but it 39 s not the same anymore here we go nose a bit of moonshine and that 39 s it palate no not really finish actually has hints of whisky so in conclusion we have a cheap 12yo that 39 s still not worth the money and despite it 39 s weak 40 only smells of alcohol wow this reminds me of a fine meursault this is pure firm and lush at the same time nicely aromatic lighter to medium bodied has a slightly stiff veneer on top and marvelous oily ripe banana oatmeal and slight oak vanilla note in the palate and retour talk about moreish if this has a maritime salty component it is well mixed into the bouquet and palate and supports counterpoints everything marvelously  oily honey sweet buttery salty pepper at the end  my palate is not particularly sophisticated but is describe my beloved old pultney 12 yo as sipping warm melted butter after trying dozens of single malts i was introduced to old pultney at a tasting held at my club it was love at first sip what a joy it is to pour a wee bit and slowly sip and savor while overseeing the grill or enjoying the calm of the evening or night sky  vanilla citrus and dark chocolate a really nice dram at a great price  dark chocolate citrus honey and a coastal hint at a great price  buttery and slighlty sea salt caramel chocolate vibe the sides of the tongue get a beautiful oily texture smells fantastic and tastes even better worth every penny nose malted grain beautiful fresh sea spray this is why i love it palate simple rounded straight forward oily not straight honey but more honey nut cheerios with creamfinish a light salted toffee if you like the saltiness and spice of something like bruichladdich than this one if also for you  tonight i went to a few uber fancy malls with some friends in a far eastern megacity and while looking for a restaurant to give us a sit down i picked up a bottle of this back home this used to one of my favourite drams to start the night with so i got it home and nothing thin almost pointless i realised it was far too cold and lifeless so i poured boiling water into a glencairn waited a couple of minutes then poured the water out added a generous measure of whisky and used a horn spoon to aerate this is the op i remember i think of highland single malts as the unsung heroes of the whisky world while people bang on about the peatiness of this or the mouth searing intensity of that highland malts particularly unsherried highland malts and especially young unsherried highland malts tend to get overlooked of course we all wish we could dine with a 45 year old glenfarclas on the side but there is a lot to be said for the well the purity of malts like op12 royal lochnagar 12 ancnoc 12 this is soft it is light a little sweet the bourbon is subtle the saltiness is subtle too what you get is the taste of high quality malted barley believe me it is enough this is a calming dram a fireside dram a dram to remind you that not everything needs to be turned up to eleven to be wonderfully enjoyable i am extremely glad i bought this again i would also point out that it has far less common now than it should be for anyone who enjoys good whisky to go back to a favourite brand ten years later and not feel disappointment  one of the very best whiskeys at 12 years of age and in the 50 price range ever in fact this is the best 40 and under scotch whisky i have ever tasted and i have to taste it between 50 and 60 scotch whiskies at various prices from 25 200 it is so smooth with tastes of honey vanilla oak apple and light sea salt the combination is wonderful even my wife enjoyed it and she is not a big drinker this is highly recommended at 40 it is a great price if you can find it for 35 and under i recommend you get multiple bottles this is easily a 4 star scotch for the price it is 5 stars  some forward fruit and vanilla notes coax you into actually tasting the entry level old pulteney rich peat and citrus are subtle but wonderful parts of taste or mixing with other drinks and the same solid finish still has simmering memories of citrus  had a bottle bought for my birthday well impressed nice and smooth with a lovely briney aftertaste  an excellent whiskey the best highlands whiskey i 39 ve had the pleasure to taste great value of it 39 s price my favorite whiskeys tend to be the islay whiskeys but old pulteney is a delight i would also say that it 39 s a great whiskey to use as an introductory whiskey to someone who 39 s only had the blended swill and formed their opinion on whiskey on that recently introduced just such a person to old pulteney 12 yo and got a great reaction a convert to good whiskey i 39 m baffled by the few low star reviews maybe they were unlucky and got some bad batch  too great a variation from one bottle to another generally pleasant enough highland daily sippers with light sweet nose and buttered honey but some bottles are offensive with harsh medicinal alcohol nose and throat burn as only length  wanted to try and was not disappointed very nice whisky and very well described on the box would definitely buy this again best whisky i 39 ve had in a while  nose honeypalette less honey more grainyfinish warm longish mostly warming alcohol i have found this whisky inconsistent some bottles wonderfully honeyed others a bit rough decent enough whisky even at its worst  drinking right now i only buy this when my local shop runs out of port askaig and glengoyne and have drunk before without joy and always thought was a bit boring however i accidentally discovered the way this can really shine is to drink it with something salty to accompany it really brings out the flavours very well somehow there 39 s some butterscotch werther 39 s type sweetness which becomes very pronounced with the salt and seaweedyness highly recommend  staggered at some of the good reviews on here not a good whisky at all so many better 12 year olds out there just purchased bottle 12 year old matured fine american oak this is not the old pulteney that i have been used to very disappointed and will not be buying again i am trying to be polite because i think you have made a mess of this what have you done  not the worst whisky i ve ever had but a long way off the best agree with others that it tastes more like a blend than a single malt i think you can get far better for the money even at 163 25 wouldn t buy again  i bought a bottle for the first time a little disappointed given the good reviews seen a little heavy on the spirit at the first taste slightly richer follow through and a slightly salty aftertaste to be honest it tasted more like a blended whisky than a malt i ll go back to glenfarclas 10 year old  each to their own but this is one of the worst whiskies i 39 ve ever had gives no pleasure on the palate avoid even at 163 25 a bottle a deservedly fine old malt wonderful  i recently finished a bottle of this it was very enjoyable i like highland and speyside whiskys not the islays my favourite whisky is oban and old pulteney is similar fresh and clean you can almost taste the salt air  currently my favourite drink recently tried a 18 year old glenfiddich and while it was lovely i still prefer this so while i 39 m sure there must still be better for crazy money for 163 30 this stuff is amazing  this has become my goto whisky such a smooth easy drink amazing  ok whisky i m not getting all the flavours from previous reviews but it is very smooth going down wouldn t buy again  just been bought this one 12 year old first pultney whiskey i 39 ve had and it seriously won 39 t be the last smooth and just a divine finish to follow  my son gifted me this exquiste highland whiskey when i retired from the fire deparment after 33 years it was the first time i have had it and it is now one my go tos i find the clear light golden color very pleasing the nose to me has some vanilla and some of the advertised sea elements it is very smooth from start to finish and i particularly enjoy the taste at mid tongue with some subtle citrus and spice the finish is dry with no harshness as you swallow  fabulously moreish a palatable sweet whisky delicate flavours with notes of butterscotch  for the price you pay you will enjoy a excellent 12 year old unfortunately i am not able to pick out the different ingredients but what i can pick out is a bloody good malt at competitive price in the malt market keep it going lovely smooth taste great value malt whiskey at 40 a bottle this is a very good 12yr okd it has a sweetness not found in single malts of this price range i m partial to highland speyside single malts and this oneis hard to beat from the initial pour you get a hint of sea salt light vanilla chocolate overtones finishes incredibly clean with a lemon zest finish on your day palate  lovely just tried first encounter with old puteney in scottish hotel this is going to be this year 39 s new year whiskey  very good single malt well rounded good value as well  this has to be one of the best whisky 39 s for the price the flavor is very sweet notes of vanilla butterscotch and lots of amaretto notes it smells nice but the flavor really hits the mark excellent  this one was a one of my first bottles when i was started my whisky adventure i love it the complexity and excellence of this malt is outstanding for its price point and an easy 5 star the nose opens with a huge sweet honey influence which gives way to oak vanilla and sea air on the palate there s chocolate and more oak before the salinity and citrus notes of this whisky really start to open up on the tongue and finally a peppery spice influence develops the finish is medium but what it lacks in length is more than compensated by incredible complexity the citrus really plays out in the finish with the salt staining the tongue which gives way to chocolate eclair sweetness at the last  really nice single malt almost same as the former one but i feel bit more character in this one just add less drops of water and wait few minutes more than usual before you drink and feel the difference excellent by the way nothing could be better for the price  same taste as huddart but more defined and less harsh still not good enough to gain more than a three out of five which is the same grade i gave huddart
35720.0, fantastic one for a cold day out on the course  my favourite i tasted many single malts but i always come back to this one i buy him in a store in amsterdam old south a hint for all you expats out there  this has got to be one of the smoothest yet pretty peaty whiskies around it is a beautiful dram which i was so happy i was able to try i purchased it as a present for my father who loves a peaty whisky our favorite was a lagavulin but ballechin has taken its place it is smooth and peaty and the peat lingers it has a stormy attribute and it is a beautiful nightcap  quite heavy smoke and tar taste round and balanced i save it for the cold winter days with lots of stormy wind from the north west scotland direction and eat it with chocolat stella coconut nectar a great find on my quest of tasting peated whisky outside of islay very smooth but wish the finish was longer i wouldn 39 t say it was heavily peated the peat was balanced unlike the balvenie 39 s 39 peat week 39 offering nice  happy thanksgiving everyone figured i 39 d go ahead and drink a hefty dram of this fine whisky as my digestif for the evening and i must say this is a good way to wash down that turkey this is a very rare whisky here in california and in fact this is the only bottle i have ever seen of this particular single malt so i had to buy it even though i am pretty sure i overpaid for it it definitely has that sweet creamy rum sherry character of edradour and the peat seems to work surprisingly well with it kind of a creamy smoky whisky almost mocha like i wouldn 39 t buy it again for 90 but if i saw it a bit cheaper i probably would it 39 s excellent stuff like anything from edradour cheers the sugarbear very disappointed in this malt was hoping for a more sophisticated product from edradour this tastes more like bell 39 s or grouse blend  beautiful nose of smoke and peat with some vanilla and almonds oily mouth feel with a smooth finish warmth without the burn of alcohol it s up there with talisker amp lagavulin 16  dark notes of toffee and chocolate works really well with some peatiness i wouldn 39 t call this heavily peated though and that 39 s what i like about this too much smokiness would have destroyed those dark notes  before the evening gets on and i move to my more heavily peated islay s i find ballechin to be the perfect stepping stone i think others have described it well as not complex and not preten tious just the right peatiness to get you in the mood  good for a wee bit of a change to the islay peat monsters lingering sweet vanilla smoke with a touch of fudge not complex but still a tasty glass  smokey and sweet i love it  if you are looking for an islay alternative a 39 peated highlander 39 or perhaps something like benriach septimus peated speyside and in my opinion the best unfortunately what is actually in the bottle is near as dammit ardbeg 10 which is fine if all you look for is peat but there is no subtlety nothing to balance the peat so what 39 s the point might as well stick your head over a bonfire i would advise paying a bit more and getting lagavulin 16 or the benriach peated 17  for the price you get exactly what they promise excellent balance between peat and salty sea waves with water you get notes of almond and peach i put this whisky between ardbeg 10 and ledaig 10 more peat than ardbeg and less salt than ledaig this has become my everyday drum along with ardbeg 10 and rock oyster no need to say that if you don 39 t like peat you should go for the edradour much more intense than laga in peat compared to laphroaig you get less smoke give it a try  nice very smoky and sweet  we find it smooth and little smoked beetween lagavulin and talisker splendid single malt on the nose its the smoke that hits you first and its big also sweet and quite herbal i get sugar covered almonds and basil grass in the rain rich oily even a bit buttery half way down the bottle on the tounge heavy smoke and then more smoke soon after the sweetness rolls in and the green notes takes hold it 39 s like a sugar coated lawn sprinkled with almonds just add some marzipan and a little pepper i think i 39 ve tasted some really fine tequila that almost measures up to this the balance is quite superb finish sweet and smoky without being quot peaty quot at all this malt does not ship me off to sea the oak is pushing its way through now and i get white pepper and smoked ham alongside basil and thyme a moderate bitterness at a medium length nice smoky whisky from edradour and a good ten year old standard norrlandwhisky
5937.0, expectations were a lot higher it 39 s not that it 39 s a bad dram farthest from it 14 year 46 and under 163 50 it certainly does tick all the boxes unfortunately it misses out a few of them too i feel its not very complex for its age and its over briny in the finish for me also nevertheless it 39 s still an okay ish dram i guess but got plenty more i would have to put before it in same year and price range a very nice change of pace from my islay fixation floral fruity but with substance and a great value here in canada  nothing special sweet medicinal nose peppery and bitter oak finish  really disappointed in this one just cant pinpoint flavours which is no fun clynelish 14 miles better wont buy again  nice spicy hit to start great mouthfeel perfect at 46 to open up with a few drops of water just the right amount of baking spice and heather before a long raisin finish this will be a crowd pleaser that will also please the picky not everyone 39 s cup of tea i presume but i know where my cardhu and bowmore are if i need smoke or peat for the evening very impressed will be going down to the 10 yr next and trying whatever other cask finished arran offerings are available in ontario at about 90 cdn this delivers big value  caramel and chocolate and licorice pungent green countryside summer smells nettles and weeds and ferns and thistles bit yogurty too really deep caramel fragrant rich super moreish  big upgrade on the 10 year for me loads of notes of stewed fruits and spices big and long great mouthfeel too  ｃｈｏｃｏｌａｔｅ ｈｅａｖｅｎ チョコレート天国  as mentioned a solid whisky for the price as good as many bottles twice the price love sherry finished whisky but not the biggest fan of this one personal taste but a bit sickly sweet for me great flavour and nose very oily little heat in the finish nice enjoyable whisky but won 39 t blow you away maybe a little critical was hoping this would become my go to daily dram but it 39 s not quite there enjoyable but lacking a bit in complexity convinced me to try the 18 128077  just finished a tasting of 12 different whiskies rock oyster from douglas laing came out on top followed by this arran close second followed by the hakushu at third place evis china jan 2018 creamy caramel salty licorice nettles pears but you 39 ll have to go looking for them not as malty as i 39 d been led to believe oakier than the 10 good oaky harmonizes with the rest of the flavors intense dense delicious  i really like this i picked up an older bottling on a duty free island for a ridiculously low price and was quite keen to try it as it ticked all the basic boxes higher abv ncf no colouring and hey it has a proper age statement the arran 14 has a fruity nose with a bit of spice layered in and it 39 s pretty easy to pick up the subtle bourbon cask influence on the palate it 39 s creamy and balanced though not overly complex quite malty which works really well here i pick up stone fruits and vanilla with the sweet attack nicely complemented by a full body and delightfully spicy finish the sweetness lingered beautifully on the sides of my tongue long after the whisky had been swallowed frightfully easy to drink with a few drops of water added really a nice effort from the arran and very much recommended if this were a peated whisky it would rocket to the top of my list but as it is it 39 s still right up there among my new favourites  地方的分公司答复 after the misses left me malty goodness was the only escape 9 10 could do with more yeast  this is a well crafted whisky i find good young whisky are driven by excellent quality grain and careful distillation as excellent aged whisky are the above with with the addition of good quality cask maturation this whisky is a young whisky coming of age i had a whisky tasting with friends and this was the first of 6 whisky 39 s and a perfect choice will buy again  i have tried several single malts there is usually no single malt that i don 39 t like all different all with your place in the world except those who for some reason comes with a strange taste of throw away as has happened to me 2 times some people have already commented something like taste of sulfur however there are some of those that emerges in our list of preferences for its quality on the palate clean and flawless with a sequence of flavours always with the malt flavor that i really appreciate with arran 14 i don 39 t feel flaws but a good balance between the flavors that i don 39 t distinguish with pleasant spicy and a slight effervescence always with an excellent malt flavor i think any fan of whiskey will not be indifferent to this arran 14 and some will find here a top whisky  apricot sweet citrus fruits and sea spray this is like walking along an empty foggy beach with an old dock in the background eating an apricot delicious flavors and so drinkable i have been drinking scotch for about 2 years now and this is easily my favorite  respect for an non chillfiltered and no additional colour product lovely nose peaches oranges vanilla oak i expected a thicker and more full bodied whisky more complexity lack of maturity on the palate no taste wave but it 39 s harmony there and it 39 s an ok dram with hint of salt in the finish ok for its price i think the distillery needs more time to develop more refined products 1995 is not a long time ago when it comes to evolution  nice and fruity tried a double in arran whish id bought that rather than the lochranza single malt fruity and smooth a pleasant surprise best whisky i ever tasted in this price group so addictive it should be banned yummie  really solid this has a very nice long spicy finish  ucf nc 46 ralfy 39 s best of the arran range sherry strong fruit full complex citrus amp spicy finish long why are there so many malts 2x to 3x this price that are thin weak colored and simple keep producing arran  very good smooth lovely stuff tried a batch of samples from across the different regions and settled on arran 14 not too sweet not too nippy leaves a warm glow as a good dram of malt should  this certainly hits my sweet spot lovely nose with sherry and a meadow of wild flowers in high summer perfectly balanced with good chewy mouth feel toffee vanilla honey flowers hint of almond no burn and a long lingering finish full of spices and a little liquorice root absolutely marvellous i 39 ll be back for another bottle of this for sure  i was looking for something different from my usual pot stills and this was recommended by a local off license owner it is fantastic the nose is massive sherry with some floral notes on drinking it becomes very floral with a lot of sweeter notes i get slight marzipan honey amp heather and a tiny bit of toffee the finish lingers just long enough to enjoy and has some nice spices in there fantastic whisky and a great one to add variety to any collection i will always have a bottle of this  impressive whisky fresh sweet and full arran goes in the right direction  we found this dram to be pleasantly creamy a nice vanilla tinge with complex blossomy undertone with an after taste of charred wood  in my top 3 of all time and i have had a lot of good whisky  10 10 that is all forget the price this is as good as bottles i have had which are 5x the price simply stunning whisky  was hesitating in buying it what a good choice real good stuff  i m finishing the last dram of the bottle just now i ve really enjoyed it fruity citrus vanilla a hint of honey note of apple blossom and sea salt warm pull on your wool sweater put it in a flask and take it on a walk along the shore or a hill top  smooth and fiery with a fruity body with a creamy vanilla malt finish bought this on recommendation and could not be happier with it  this is a very good whisky having read mixed reviews about this malt my curiosity finally got to me and i purchased a bottle and i am so glad that i did this is a very very good whisky fullbodied sweet fruity balanced and a little heat in finish and i just love the nose on this one pluss it s bottled at 46 no coloring and non chill filtring well done arran will definitely buy another bottle when i have finished this one love from norway isle of arran distillers are now producing real quality malts and this is a cracker lots of zesty fruit with that wonderful trademark arran golden spice i truly feel that these are best appreciated by an educated drinker such as myself but of course they are available to anyone j saxon
89849.0, it 39 s good goons after years of searching i found the perfect whiskey in the 12 year old quinta ruban heaven to my dismay they have changed it the 14 year old is not a patch on the old one gutted  bought this as i love the 12 year old and thought 14 could only be better how wrong i was this is totally different none of the beautiful port flavours and lovely finish notes this is cheap tasting and has a hint of peat which was definitely not in the 12 just gutted waste of 100 bucks  lacks the robustness and depth of the 12 year old gone are the intense complex flavours and the nice long after taste overall like it 39 s diluted even the colour is aenemic anything diagio touches seems to go backwards like talisker and lagavulin 16 maybe i just have an unsofisticated palate anyone who gives this a good review never appreciated the far superior 12 year old i won 39 t be buying this again  if glenmorangie had never made the 12 yo then this would probably be fine but they did and this isn 39 t disappointing all the way bring back the 12 year old  nose spice tangerine rose petal come through as well the result is both complex and balanced palate first flavours are spice but nut and citrus notes follow i was expecting this whisky to be as spirited as its 12yo sibling but not so the additional 2 years has changed this from a sharp to very smooth makes for easy drinking finish long and more complex than a regular glenmorangie should be there 39 s chocolate with citrus and finally a hint of port summary i was astounded at the difference 2 years makes i was not too enamoured with the 12yo quinta but the 14yo is superb  hot and sweet not sure that is the best combination a disappointing dram  seriously nice whisky good value for money i was excited when i ordered the 14 year old version bit absolutely gutted when i tasted it don t get me wrong it is ok but nowhere near the 12 year old please bring back the 12 year version  the 12 yr is much better after tasting the 14 yr i purchased the remaining 12 yr bottles in my area  nose breaded dessert damned good palate mid mouth feel an autumn fire wooded spiced evening where is the port after not long not bad mostly spice descends  a spot of o2 brings lots of almond on nose and oranges and more almonds plus summer fruits in mouth not a long finish but well controlled this is best with a splash of water and is imo thus more complex and smoother than the old 12 struth if you 39 re trying to replace the 12 as i was this will not do the job the complexity and most importantly the finish are just not comparable that said it 39 s a fair whisky in its own right it 39 s pleasant on the palate with the port finish giving it a distinct taste its finish isn 39 t remarkable the flavour disappears quickly will evolve considerably upon opening so if you don 39 t like it at first leave it a few weeks before going back to it  love this but really enjoyed the 12 should bring it back choice is good a friend recommended it i thank him it was excellent i paired it with a nice cigar and enjoyed an end of day chill time on the porch overlooking acres of open fields with a star filled sky nice end to the day  i usually drink islay whiskey laphroig and ardbeg in particular but this stuff is just awesome it 39 s a seriously good quality malt especially for the price and it 39 s just flat out delicious i 39 ll always have a bottle of this stuff on my shelf  wouldn t recommend and certainly won t purchase again glenmorangie was my favorite whiskey back in the eighties like many great distillers now owned by large conglomerates  i had a small sample pack of 4 glenmirangie scotch whiskeys this was my favorite  found the port influence overpowering not to my taste unfortunately tastes like old sour gone off wine could possibly be a bad bottle but i m not buying another one to find out  oh yes delivery as advertised first port finish buy and glenmorangie buy i like defined flavors don t always register for this amateur palate but the finish is dark chocolate and sweet tart cherries  excellent in every single aspect complex full bold and stimulating  a beautiful dram this whisky is one of the finest smelling whiskies i ve ever stuck my nose near to taste wise it ain t too shabby either strong hints of chocolate and caramel it s quite thick very very whisper it smooth can t recommend enough knocked off half a point because let s face it nothing is perfect guttedthis is a nice whisky yes it is but knowing how sublime the quinta ruban 12 is i am totally gutted to find that this is the replacement why tinker with one of the best whiskies it was in a league of its own with only a select few to rival now it is just nice i used to repeatedly buy the 12 i have finished the 14 but will not buy another bottle better out there on the market appreciate the experimental nature of glenmorangie it has led to some gems but this time it has discontinued an all time favourite of mine rip you will be missed full of flavor when served warm cold flavored raw  two words to describe this would be hot and bitter bring back the 12 now  i never had the qr12 but had few bottles of the lasanta and really liked it qr14 is much better it has so many different tastes and yet so smooth it is especially good when looking on the price tag  nothing like the 12 yr old more of an alcohol taste the 12 year old was my favorite when the 14 yr is gone i will not be back bushmils 16yo yes i know but trust me on the sunscreen be prepared for ur wallet to sting though lolprevious rvw hit the nail on the head here i 39 ll give u 163 80 for one of ur limited edition 12yo 39 s jks  not as good as the 12 year old this is good but nowhere near as good as the 12 this version lacks depth with less of a port influence less of a fruity aroma as well i bought 4 bottles of the 12 before they disappeared and i 39 m glad that i did  less smooth and inferior generally to the 12 year old tested side by side  inferior substitute to the 12 year old totally agree tried side by side with 2 separate bottles of the 14 year old hoping i got a dud the 12 year old was my favourite glenmorangie so far the 12 year was exceptional now once i ve finished my last stashed bottle i will sadly have to search other brands again  fantastic whisky happened upon this at the grill in aberdeen and it s a very sweet easy drinking speyside worth every penny  this is inferior to the 12 year old so sad the 12 year old is gone it was exceptional this is a second rate substitute that lacks the dark full depth of it 39 s predecessor i loved the quot portwood quot finish back in the day the original qr was great my expectations are high for the 14 yr old  less red berry fruit which i luv 39 d in the 12 but a fraction smoother also more velvety on the tongue not worse just different good wood is scarce amp i think the extra 2 years is adequate in compensating for the ever decreasing flavour you get every refill shame though i still think the 12 was alas poot yorick better imo but only just  picked up a bottle for the first time yesterday excellent taste with a great price point i have a new favorite whisky  a beautiful whisky sweet and warm no smoke but a sweet aromatic perfume on the palate just cake and fulfillment highland perfection from glenmorange for sipping and savoring  it was the older 12 year expression that first got me into scotch this is fantastically smooth a bit sweeter than i would usually go for but the complexity is wonderful and the price bumps it up half a star to 5 for the longest time i wanted try either the 12 year lasanta or quinta ruban but i never got around to trying these i skipped from the original 10 year to this masterpiece 14 year quinta ruban this scotch might be one of the most elegant complex whiskies i have ever come across the nose will yield a chocolate citrus and spicy aroma upon the tasting you are greeted with spice yet velvet sensation that soon turns into a wave of chocolate and citrus flavors that complement one another the medium to long finish ends with a chocolate mint flavor and light citrus ending i am impressed with the smooth and spicy flavor from this scotch so much i do not even feel the 46 abv do yourself a favor and try this unique scotch for a great experience  very satisfying great for sipping around a campfire the fresh air of outdoors the smoke from the fire combine to heighten the senses to appreciate the experience of this whisky  inferior to the 12 year old to my taste i 39 ve favoured the 12 year old for several years and after a direct comparison over 10 days it comes out on top by a long way it 39 s perfect most likely unbeatable i only hope they don 39 t meddle any more or discontinue it  very disappointed tasted face to face with the 12 yr old and there was no comparison the 12 year old was subtle perfection and the 14 year old is kind of run of the mill color nose taste all off and inferior to the 12 year old what the heck happened i wanted to love it  the only other port finished whisky i have ever had is the qr 12 so it s the only thing i can compare this too all i can is that there is an extra two years of bourbon cask toffee and spice to balance out the tart fruit sweetness from the port finishing excellent stuff if you love the 12 or good whisky in general be sure to give this a try 
71131.0,
36995.0, certainly a complex malt that needs time to show its character lovely oily texture with hints of nuts and spearmint unusual but delicious wow beautiful complex smooth lush sweet pineapple with a nutty finish  very surprised to see it listed of part of a quot robust bold quot example of this distillery 39 s output which i admit is unfamiliar to me i found my first taste to be very enjoyable but quite subtle with an unexpected touch of sweetness and i certainly agree that there are lovely fruity notes that probably account for it interestingly enough my wife who enjoys the dalwhinnie thought it delicious all in all a find malt and good value cheers  nose citrus toffee hints of wood and some banana palate spicy wood dominates a very light and balanced thin sherry palate after echoed coffee but otherwise fades quickly  tidy drop but i m fcked how the master of malt can find 12 yes 12 different flavours in this drop take ya hands off it 129322  don t like it very heavy and sulphuric on the palate on the nose it s wonderful not my cup of whisky  i 39 m 69 budget 15 year taster when i was flush a 39 bunadh was king read a bunch of reviews about this whisky and bought two delivered this afternoon so happy decided to leave a rare comment for someone like me looking for a righteous old world oily robust huge flavor whisky for around 60 bucks on line in the u s oily muscular warm delicious flavors 92 proof wonderful heat not filtered original same as it was in 1891 i use the 39 tongue spoon 39 style of tasting i cup my tongue take a sip move my head around a little taste the flavors then soft inhale into my throat a nice warm rush finally swish around my mouth subdued explosion fantastic before i sat down to write this i pulled the pin and ordered two more bottles time to go back to the living room for another sip  huaooo un 13enne eccezionale una combinazione di sapori veramente al top consigliato  light very delicate and complex i never enjoyed scotch until sampling craig i 39 m hooked enjoyed after a decadent meal at level 55 in melbourne i am normally a islay tragic but this gem was o so smoth with a delicate lingring finish just got back to hotel room and i am comparing it to a select laphroaig and you can t they are different animals but i will be sourcing one very interesting complex more friendly to my palate than some of the heavy peat flavors the tiny suggestion of smoke was perfect  i found this speyside a littlet harsh to begin with added some ice let it melt it got better by the sip what did wonders is to let it sit after opening the bottle 46 abv can be too much but letting this baby breathe was a real game changer for me and my partner we now absolutely love every single drop we can get from this bottle it is very complex some say meaty i taste apples spices and honey i am sure one could get a lot more out of it but to me there is just so much going on forever from my nose palate tongue and throat while sipping it that the flavours and aromas all meet together to become one of the taste what might be one of the most exquisite whiskeys i have ever had i have drank bottles twice the price of this one and now sure know what is a good bang for your buck  just opened a bottle of the 13 year old my normal tastes run to lagavulin talisker 10 caol ila and sometime mccallan red stripe the reviews here are from o 5 stars everyone has an opinion i am a well seasoned scot 39 s whisky drinker and i was nicely surprised this has a very fruity nose pineapple caramel saline and orange peel on the tasting it has a very light hint or smoke but this is a concentrated complex very fine whisky if you drink 40 abv blended whisky and your palette has not tasted many single malts you probably may or may not like this this is a grand cru whisky it is the finest whisky i have ever tasted from speyside and i have tried most of them at this price point i don 39 t think i would ever buy anything else i still love my whisky from islay but i am loving this gem from speyside  i don 39 t like to give bad reviews but i found this really horrible stuff i bought a bottle based on the reviews here most of them being very positive shows you that tastes do differ  the nicest whiskey i have tasted with a long time bloody lovely want very impressed but for the price there are worse options for sure good malt for the price 43 at the nex on sale i 39 m not going to ramble about fruity or smoke or any of that the taste is on the tongue of the sipper like my malts and this is a good one wow  i cannot get the flavor and smell of banana oil isoamyl acetate out of my head while drinking this having bought it on the strength of reviews i saw everywhere i was disappointed  fruity quickly develops to spicy mellows back to little citrussy and finishes to a mild pleasant fruity taste somewhat unique  wonderful enough said  pineapple cube sweets in a waxy paper bag from the corner shop ting jamaican fizzy drink cheap vanilla soft scoop ice cream  intense nose and mouth smoke many fruits pleasant palate burning intense long finish particular swells by adding water  d 233 licieux the craigellachie 13 ans complex not very emphatic in any particular aspect but very intriguing not dumbed down at all for the mass market a well put together and appropriately matured single malt i recommend you give it a try and i myself am looking very much forward to trying the older versions 192 ta sant 233 mxg belgium  smoked bbq complex fruit nice burn long and amazing finish more highland than a speyside this will be my new fave after talisker 10 and bunnahabhain i really like the presentation the bottle and label design is just fabulous  honey caramel like a full young brandy a delicate presence of apples and a hint of pears which comes out more with water good general mouthfeel though viscosity is lower than expected sulfur sulfur smoke prominently heavy gristy but not at all harsh maltiness they say this has a meaty character to it but i would say it is bready specifically i get bread sticks kind you get in restaurants touch of olive oil tiny bit of garlic little bit spirity i will say even with water added takes one teaspoon just fine but not much more than that careful does it this being my first speysider i would compare it to the arran 14 and say that they are fairly similar when it comes to their rich armagnac like qualities the c13 being the lighter and more honeyed of the two and where arran gives you its distinct nettle like oakiness craigellachie gives you the sulfur medium creamy toffee development long sulfuric bread stick finish needs aeration plenty of time in the glass compacts down soon after opening similar to the glengoyne 10 and needs a couple of days to come back up would not hurt to decant it all in all a very very interesting dram the fruit is a little less pronounced than i 39 d like it to be and it is slightly spirity but the overall presentation and uniqueness of this dram takes it up to a 5 5 for me will revisit review if shows improvement further down the bottle colors are flying lads originally posted on march 29 2018  canned fruit cocktail fruits red ones yellow ones tangerines grapefruit and pomegranate orange peels yellows and mellows with time in the bottle reminiscent of an unpeated caol ila i could have sworn i got a whiff of something wet sherry cask like hp like almost heathery out of the bottle one day but i 39 ve lost it gooseberries apricot marmalade cream vanilla sugar cloudberry marmalade and thick sweet sour cream a combination i tried in some pancake roll ups once delicious frozen yogurt sassafras root ginger molasses rum like dense waxy malt malty chili note cocoa powder dusty cocoa bit bitter classic style dry seltzer water mineral old oak in the background like oak furniture sitting in a house built in the 1800s walnuts honey natural and pungent unprocessed the sulfur tones ever so slightly down and marries with the caramelly fullness of this dram with aeration excellent stuff addendum end  funny how for some people who are used to 40 quot smooth quot spirits anything interesting can be too harsh or astringent while others dismiss so many malts as quot just another speysider quot i found this one a total delight and a standout now everyone rates based on perceived value i got my 1l bottle at niagara falls duty free just under 50 us so i am very happy with this one and it 39 s a special occasion pour if you are accustomed to lower abv spirits please realize that quot craft presentation quot malts 46 or more non chill filtered no colorant added are not quot easy access quot like your 40 quot smooth quot stuff they require some contemplation experimentation with how much water to add time to open up etc like reading a serious book vs watching tv stronger bottlings are not about the supposed manliness of drinking it neat no matter the abv but about carrying more flavor into the glass master blenders typically dilute to around 35 to be able to perceive the complexity because ethanol is anesthetic at stronger concentrations also fresh water has dissolved oxygen in it so it helps to oxidize the whisky to open it up so if you are proud of not adding ice to your whisky realize that drinking it without a few drops of water is similar to drinking it chilled it dulls your senses from perceiving the most interesting aromatics granted some people like the bite above all so preferences will vary but if you are into flavor try it with water experiment for me the malts i had initial difficulty with are now among favorites ardbeg 10 old pulteney 12 highland park 12 glenmorangie quinta ruban 12 while some of the easy pleasy malts like glenfiddich 12 and tomintoul 10 are less interesting to me now while there 39 s nothing offensive about them  just tried this not 30 minutes ago this is my first speyside so i have nothing to compare it against but on it 39 s own it is a wondrous delight the color is a pale straw to golden very light clear with no sediments it 39 s viscosity is on the lighter side about half that of monkey shoulder this is a friendly scotch on the nose when in a snifter i found notes of clove and apple with a light touch of smoke and salt it 39 s light but not bright like a mint or an irish the taste was a joy it 39 s nothing like an irish whiskey with its buttery sugar cookie notes but reminds me more of a field on shoreline of the east coast you get tastes of cloves honey apple salt and smoke you know that moment you experience surrounded by freshly mown grass in the cooling dusk of an early summer it 39 s like that i could 39 ve spent hours drinking this  notes of caramel toffee smoke very nice scotch i like the sweetness and harmony with honey and floral finish just a splash of spring water brings it all together  i had never tried this whisky before a fabulous find not over fussy or complicated just a great smooth delicious drink sad to say i was at a craigellahice whisky tasting last night and nothing from the 13 17 19 23 was to my palate much of this for me is to do with the minimal copper contact provided by the distillery very astringent with and without water the 31yr was a little better but that is just the wood playing its part  while not a bad scotch it doesnt have much to make me come back to buy another bottle when theres so many others out there to try it has a floral and slightly 39 grassy 39 nose which is pleasant but when im deciding what to drink on a night its not one that stands out from other speysides that have a bit more to them as well as being a tad cheaper  first glance at the font on the label made me apprehensive don 39 t know why it just did fears abated immediately upon tasting nice warm honey floral and just the right amount of smoke it even changed my opinion of the label highly recommend  maybe first and biggest miss hit for me here smooth but that 39 s it simplistic taste and practically scentless hard to believe that stuff like cragganmore get less here it 39 s day and night  a complex whiskey that takes you on a bit of a journey each time you pour yourself a dram wonderfull stuff  clever old fashion packing is a great marketing trick even in a price of the taste  so i saw all the great reviews on this whisky and figured i should get some for myself and it is an excellent and very unique speysider indeed fruity with lots of charred oak and honey fading to a dry herbal floral finish not really sure what to compare it to but considering i 39 ve been drinking a lot of sherried speysides lately this is great for a change would highly recommend this a good example of old school scotch the sugarbear has a banana nose at first the flavor really comes out with 1 3 water very long finish  i 39 m not going to get nuanced on this it 39 s a good no nonsense dram that you will not be disappointed with i like the packaging and the bottle too pick up the bottle hold it for a while smile let the expectations build then tuck into a fine snifter  loved it smooth delicious taste steak it served over an ice ball many of you may cringe but it 39 s how i had it title says it all if you see one buy drink one  i love almost anything from the speyside region of scotland and this single malt is no different it is made at the confluence of the river spey and river fiddich this 13 year old scotch is one if my favourites because i m into quality not quantity i normally go for 16 20 year old scotch but tried this based on the great ratings so glad i did this has a tad bit of honey tones and a strong smooth finish that leaves you wanting more i m ordering more as i type this  an outstanding and easy to drink dram  love it  magnificent  i was very impressed with this bottle sweet and fruity on entry but there is more complexity on the back end and a dry finish not what i expected from a speyside malt  excellent my current favourite easily beating some of the more expensive malts  simply magnificent i went straight back and bought another bottle to hide from guests a delightfully sour nose suggestive of an ebb tide caresses the tongue with a sweet velvet feel good balance with firm smoke bang centre high notes of peaches and cream hints of mackerel tar and aniseed in the finish which lasts the rest of the evening i will dream about this one  this is sensational dry yet fruity oaky yet spirit pure robust yet elegant and what a finish but i should shout as well what an arrival and what a middle palate what an everything i didn 39 t know a speyside could be this full bodied yet retain some elegance and refinement  high quality whisky bottled at 46 abv un chilled filtered and natural color notes of fruits specifically young unripe fruits such as green apples citrus herbal and oak not sweet at all if you like sweet than this is not for you i would say its quite bitter but its very good indeed i will definitely order a second bottle  on my forth bottle of this gem it has to be the best 13 yr old i ever had it should be standard practice no chill filtration 46 abv no e150 colorant used this single malt gives most older scotches something to aspire to 40 abv coloring chill filtered standard bullshit in the scotch industry bravo craigellachie welcome to america  a long wait for an official bottling but worth it plenty of flavour a bit of smoke and a long rewarding finish from memory maybe not as full bodied as the old 14 year old but memories can play tricks on you  golden color it is not chill filtered so it gets cloudy when it gets cool nose is herbal oaky with some fruit in the background give it a drop of water and some time and nose emerges nicely delivery is big and oaky citrus herbal with slight dried fruit on the palate finish is quite long oaky amp dry the label claims this is old fashioned whisky i believe it i like it not floral or sweet like many speysiders very entertaining 
77699.0, while this is a superb whisky in its own right the words 39 heavily peated islay single malt 39 in big letters on the bottle lead you to expect more islay peat judged against the other big islays the strength of flavour in this is a bit disappointing this is quite subtle for an islay  the complexity of this whisky is remarkable starts with intense peat and sea salt on the beach at low tide then moves to caramel before darkening to treacle on it 39 s way to the lightly singed citrus and vanilla notes at the end all while having a sweet lassie fanning cool smoke into your nostrils one dram demands a second  i 39 m normally a real fan of a jura with the rare islay i 39 ve tried not really hitting the mark however this is an absolute belter the smoke is strong but the complexity that goes with it works beautifully it just draws you in and gets better and better  marvellous tasting whisky floral vanilla sweet and very smokey but not a chimney smoke that overpowers a beautifully complex whisky with many layers by far my favourite  fantastic whisky i really enjoy the islay malts laphroaig ardbeg and lagavulin are absolutely incredible but when the port charlotte distillery temporarily reopened in the first part of 2010 39 s i couldn 39 t wait to try a bottle i finally got a chance this is a dram that is not to be toyed with the flavor is incredible and at 50 it 39 ll make you blush enjoy  nose is smoky briny maritime i 39 m reminded of oysters on salt crackers tastes starts with pepper and smoke hints of vanilla sweetness it 39 s a bit hot but not overpowering nice long finish medium mouth feel vanilla oak and smoke enjoying this so much  om nom nom  great islay whisky great balance between smoke sweetness and medicinal notes not as briney as lagavulin 16 not as much iodine as laphroig not as smokey as octomore smooth despite the 50 abv tiniest bit of water changes the dram and pulls through the sweeter flavours buy it enjoy it  got this for my birthday can t think of a better present  this is a fabulous islay reminds me of my favourite caol ila distillers edition which is finished in moscatel casks powerful at 50 and heavily peated but smooth and sweet with a long smokey finish wonderful stuff especially for the price if you re a fan of caol ila lagavulin and ardbeg uigeadail in particular you re going to love this one  order a bottle now and then send me a bottle as a thank you stunning whisky pouring a dram of this makes you smile from ear to ear and feel warm inside even before you 39 ve had a sip slainte  full of smoke and deep peaty notes one to be ordered more than once mzb this really is a superb whisky the perfect marriage between peat and smoke the finish is so mouthwatering and lingering well worth having a bottle of this in your collection what 39 s to be said about it this is what an islay malt should be as perfect as it gets nowadays a real and i reiterate a real islay single malt perfection  tried this for the first time at a pub in glasgow i 39 m not a big peaty fan but this is good stuff i made sure the bar staff gave it to me in a decent glass and it was bloody good stuff high abv natural colour and salty i will be buying a bottle soon  i m drinking this as i write this review and i must say this is one of the most balanced islay whiskies i ve ever come across perfect blend of peat and especially smooth for 50 it s hard to believe that s the abv buy this one if you see it it s a true gem very happy i bought this after reading the positive reviews here it s 40 ppm but don t let that turn you off from trying it if you re new to the region they did a great job with this i want to say thanks to everyone here that convinced me to try it much love  reminds me of frazzles those smokey bacon flavoured crisps from my childhood but in liquid form of course  incredible i 39 ve been searching through the islay whiskies recently was a huge fan of jura in the old range superstition and prophecy always liked laphroaig and recently begun enjoying ardbeg 10 took a shot at this at 163 50 and was not disappointed i find it hard to describe the palate but definitely get some creaminess at the end which with the peat tastes sublime this is one of my top drams will definitely keep this in stock  port charlotte 10 tops my list of islay drams i love them all but i think this one is special historically i routinely drink laphroaig 10 ardbeg 10 and lagavulin 16 since having the port charlotte 10 it 39 s the one dram i gravitate to it 39 s absolutely flavourful i won 39 t break my tasting palate down into individual flavors as i think it 39 s very subjective and variable but i will say smoky peated and sweet is what i get from this wonderful dram consistently for me the first few sips are peated with more and more sweetness as i progress what else can i say i love it my only hope is that bruichladdich can maintain the consistency of this fantastic 10 yo  for me not as peaty as lagavulin or laphroaig but brimful of character and flavour and incredibly smooth for a 50 malt a joy and delight in every way  this has become my first pick for islay whisky i love ardbeg laphroaig and lagavulin big peat fan in general this pc10 is simply stunning and one that i keep coming back to amazing rich and full texture despite the heavily peated designation it is really very well balanced and not dominated by peat at all fresh smoke medicinal notes are gentle in my opinion  i appreciate i m in the minority here but i was very disappointed by the port charlotte 10 it tastes younger than its age reminded me of cheap unaged continental fruit brandies and lacks a sense of balance like a bad whisky that s been peated for the sake of it for peat s sake perhaps i really would have liked to have enjoyed this especially after spending 163 50 on it but would probably rank this around the same level as a mediocre bowmore in my islay rankings  excl 10 yr still young but not harsh with delightful notes of carmel and smoke it feels more sophisticated and rivals established 12 and 14 yr olds worth the try  monster islay good taste as good as lagvu 16 and ardberg if you want peaty this is the one very good cheers i 39 m really enjoying this it 39 s well balanced smokey whisky  smoky wonderful flavor  robust warming ideal for cold nova scotia evenings excellent value  a great intro for those new to islay offerings with bags of peaty goodness with out getting into some of the funky taste quot aquired quot components such as one might encounter with a laphroaig nothing here to scare one off the enchanted isle just incredible flavourful depth with a warm smokey finish that seems to go on for hours  i love lagavulin ardbeg and coal ila laphroaig 10 not so much there is definitely something that reminds me of laphroaig but with a bit more sweetness it 39 s almost as if you mixed one of the 3 above with laphroaig there 39 s no missing that hint of bandaidy medicinal ting in the finish overall a good dram  feed me till i want no more what more can one say realy good and has the great blend of smokey taste  purchased this today at dan murphy s after reading the reviews this dram is right up there with laphroaig 10 and ardbeg 10 and lagavulin 16 has a great blend of smokey taste best without any additional water 50 abv is superb a wonderful whisky great value for money love it  lovely and complex nose is smokey and medicinal in a good way slight sweetness and hints of orange tasting gives the expected antiseptic flavours but not overpowering a little sweetness takes off the edge finish gives a good hit of peat and oakiness really good and worth the price  received as a birthday present if tasting blind i would have guessed cask strength laphroaig rather than ardbeg as others have suggested a bit too hot alcoholic and sweet for my tastes but i may buy again  bruichladdich have crafted something wonderful here port charlotte 10 yo sits easily with the other titans of islay with an assuredness it perhaps doesn 39 t have a right to given the distillery only recommenced production in the early 2000 39 s it has the disinfectant briny iodine notes typical of young islay whiskies with a rich malty sweetness and a hint of aniseed underneath this is smoother and more complex than ardbeg 10 laphroaig 10 doesn 39 t even come close but i still prefer lagavulin 8 so i took half a star off  it says on the label its heavily peated id say its not that peated its nice but at 50 pounds its to expensive quite a rough finish ardbeg is much nicer for same kind of money it lakes that sugar mixed with water in a ash tray finish that ardbeg 10 year old has x as i sip this i may tell you this starts with a strong alcoholic waft followed quickly by peat smoke and spices on tasting you get a dry saltiness of smoke if that makes sense long salty afterburn not harsh but not smooth drops of water bring out the sweets  interesting reading the reviews there are clearly some ardbeg fans out there i wonder how many of them are wed to youtube reviews for me the port charlotte is a league above ardbeg 10 dont get me wrong if i had to list my top 10 whiskies ardbeg 10 is top 3 port charlotte is a different proposition though ardbeg is very much dry peat a stereotype the pc has a much rounder offering it carries 50 amazingly well and the balance of sweet and sour is perfection its not all about the massive peaty punch there isnt the raw saltiness of ardbeg either i think the pc is worth the extra just because its that bit more special this said i still wouldnt swap either for a springbank but thats a different story altogether for me the pc is a must try the nose is quite fruity sweet and extremely interesting i would have guessed this is much lower than 50 abv and enjoyed nosing for quite some time the peat sweet and sour balance in this whisky is sensational the mouth feel gives the tingling illusion of slight carbonation combined with the accent of white grape reminds me of champagne but with fortitude the long mouth watering finish is alive and calmly oscillates between white pepper salt and fruit don 39 t be afraid of the phenol rating because it is truly harmonious with the sweet and salty tones  experience wise it is a fairly good standard islay malt for an entry level 10yo it is rather good nevertheless it is not substantially better than its islay sibblings for instance ardbeg 10 surely it is worth a full bottle purchase however you should be aware that there are other classic peaters that are just as good and more affordable  not as good as ardbeg 10 yet costs much more it s almost as expensive as the uigeadail which is miles better i m glad they released a pc with an age statement as a standard offering but they also raised the price too much on it   yellow fruit also like a caol ila honey melon tangerines orange peels slight hint of blood orange cloud berries hint of tobacco whipped cream fudge nice and salty sour bite hint of black pepper on the finish well rounded 39 smooth 39 if you will i said below that this was most reminiscent of an ardbeg 10 but that was the neck pour and with water added the intensity of the peat and the fullness of the fruit both come out much more with air in the bottle i would ultimately compare this to a half and half fruity salty nutty caol ila bowmore blend flavor city the end  not as dry on the palate as an ardbeg but drier on the nose big vanilla floral but less vegetal than abg custard i do not get any real presence of iodine or medicinality here custardy cream like mouthfeel pleasantly sweet well balanced luxurious and altogether delicious applause for true craft very very close to the ardbeg ten perhaps a lighter weight ardbeg  smoky peaty insidious malt don 39 t know where the orange comments come from maybe they 39 ve had orange stuff with or before my second favourite after jura i don 39 t usually drink whisky like this but then it 39 s not usually made as well as this this has an authentically brash young islay tang with lemon in the top note and a deeply satisfying quot pretzel quot finish but it is not harsh well worth buying especially at this price  i get a distinct lime citrus flavour on the tongue and not quite the smoke  after only recently acquiring a taste for malt whisky i found i enjoyed laphroaig and ardbeg however this port charlotte 10year old is much smoother nice and smokey more so than the ardbeg  absolutely wonderful or maybe sensational would describe this  was in strathaven hotel today and asked for a johnnie walker black label told they had none barman suggested port charlotte said not a malt man took his advice and glad i did thoroughly enjoyed it to the tune that i had 2 large ones nice dram diluted octomore mom tasting nites nail it
2533.0, good stuff i agree with the more neg reviews it is not as complex as i thought it would be i bought this after trying the livet 18 the 18 is incredible i am disappointed i paid double the price for half the value it is very one dimensional will not buy again there are better scotches for a quarter of the price i 39 ve been sipping and trying my best to appreciate it but it 39 s the same old one dimensional experience that was wayyyy overpriced a thick and smooth texture with a taste of apples and sultanas a truly balanced whiskey with a touch of cr 232 me  master of malts need to get a grip this is quite possibly one of the best scotches i have tried the peat finish is incredible after taking one taste you are sent into the hills of where it was mastered definately not the silly potpourri signature winter fruit cake come on  super tast nice drink how can anybody taste from a bottle which costs 255 american and complain of dullness harshness simple foolishness this bottle has bar far been the best i have ever opened and sipped a multitude of flavors combined with simple softness at the end of the swallow 1 don t smoke and drink taste this with a clean mouth some people are affected by eating food again clean mouth 2 shooters you clown what are you thinking fool perpetrator of common sense to the terrible with harshness what was your bottle source any chance you drank of a fake no way a person with taste rates this as a 1 5 stars of 5 muggle head to the 70 year old who rated as an 8 of ten with 4 stars yet penned it was the best in his life wouldn t that make it a ten of 10 or better fyl what you thinking to bull oney where are your taste buds what are you comparing against what is your other favourites clearly you are sure what you are drinking i lost my effort for your foolishness ok ii could be pissed all day and these lame reviews so instead here is mine i miss my bottle nope not paid here in fact the bottle that i had was gifted from hard work i didn t know its value until i searched for its replacement i loved the soft flavors soft with no choking biting acid bucking stomach turning i loved the smell before and after sips i loved the delightful flavors busting out after a couple sips hey we re all different try it with water try it with ice try it with ginger but let s be real don t try it if a 20 dollar bottle is all you can afford or want to afford it s outside our current appreciation level ps yes 65 a glass is normal in a pub no its not normal in common sense after i paid 24 dollars for a mc callum i didn t like in delta sky club i buy anything i want in the 100 range seeing it as 4 drinks in a public forum then i share my ass off making all my friends nip on drops of nectar in small glasses oh the pleasure of converting a beer swizzler into a fine taster of the scotch nectars bless you glenlivet and all the years of study and work you have shared an excellent product that deserves more than 5 stars the true 21 archive will blow your taste buds in the best way  i bought a shot at my preferred bar a couple weeks ago the 21 was sooooooo damn extraordinary i had to have a couple more shots before i left i don t regret it even though the tab was horrifying for a single night the 21 has all of the excellent qualities of its 15 and 18 year old brothers with greater complexity and some extra added benefits of its own with its excellent syrupy chocolate and coffee notes as well as some additional smoke i haven t tried the 25 and the rare older vintages but i cannot even imagine how one could improve on the 21 it is damn near perfection in a bottle the glenlivet 21 will be my next major bottle purchase sitting next to its younger brothers and the macallan 18 on my top shelf cheers ps balvenie 12 15 and 17 are not even in the same ballpark in terms of quality and complexity as the glenlivet 18 or 15 for that matter i haven t tried balvenie s older bottles but i doubt they can hold a candle to the 21 either  smooth elegant and refined subtle layers of flavor a real class act  it made me put away the johnny blue just the aftertaste is worth the price i think i ll work my way up to the xxv next thank you glenlivet i am now your faithful customer  very good  what a fantastic single malt whisky incredibly balanced  this was a giant disappointment for us it was super harsh and lacking in complexity on the nose and on the palate more like a 7 year old than a 21 year old to be fair our favorites are balvenie dalwhinie and dalmore and i would take the 12 year old from balvenie or dalmore over this any day  fantastic  i 39 ve had a couple of bottles of the archive 21 and have ordered by the glass in restaurants never disappointed consistent experience each time very rich aroma smooth mixed flavors of fruit wood and spice and a pleasant long lasting butterscotch vanilla finish  this whisky has gone straight to the crapper here is the deal the bottling is critical i had two bottles opened the first some off tastes and in the nose not drinkable i complained and provided a replacement it was modest at best maybe good at about 40 i have opened by second bottle batch 0212j and it is not half bad but not worth more than 100 there is just too much good whisky out there  light nose velvet texture taste of vanilla oak and a hint of pine sip this one slowly i 39 m getting a citrus finish  i 39 ve never asked the price of a glass neat when ordering but i was just charge us 65 for this does that sound right to anyone i loved it by the way but i think i can get xxv for less elsewhere  i am loving it one of the best  it 39 s a more robust glenlivet glad i bought this bottle as it will vanish way too fast if i don 39 t put it upjust did a side by side with the 12 and the 12 makes me smile every time this one has more going on for it pricy but you get what you pay for excuse me while i savor another dram  quick and snappy finish just nothing that warrants the price  notes as top choice from the whisky malt festival in the northern europe fave to the whisky connoisseurs definitely a winner 1of 10 best single malts in the world 2013 business insider slanjiva  sandal wood on the nose some malt on the palate and nutty flavor better with a hint of evian water not a long finish does not worth the price compares with a 15 years old glenfiddich  disappointing for a 21 year old sm quintessentially glenlivet and i am usually not a fan i 39 ve read the words muted and one dimensional those are accurate adjectives to describe it there are much more interesting scotches for less the first one that comes to mind is highland park 18  there are better single malts for the age and price of glenlivet 21 i love reading everyone 39 s opinions regarding this very mature and robust scotch whiskey for the seasoned alcoholic yes i can imagine this wouldn 39 t quite fit the bill however for the scotch connoisseur who drinks it strictly to enjoy the fullness of flavor and delicate hint of spice this is one phenomenal scotch whiskey cheers glenlivet  bland whiskey i genuinely feel sorry for your palette  this is overpriced and bland whiskey don t waste your money put it this way a macallan 12 year old is better than this every day of the week while it looks pretty there is no flavor here it just tastes like watered down black coffee please trust me when you read this step away from this one and look elsewhere aberlour 18 or the balvenie double wood 17 are a much better choices for the money  i tried a dram of this very recently and was very impressed the fragrance is strong and noticeable as soon as you have poured which i have not experienced before this whisky is very complex and spicy which would be great as a winter drink in my opinion opposed to a macallan ruby which isn t as warming and much smoother on the pallet both have a great finish i would totally agree with the review below title quot christmas presents quot i have scored this whisky an 8 as i think you get almost as much bang for your buck in the glenlivet 15 yo which i own a bottle of  it s a good scotch but i can think of better scotches for the money personally i think macallan 12 is better than this scotch but the 21 is rare and old so why not i enjoyed the presentation more than anything and i also like the color and flavor although it is a bit one dimensional with wood and a muted spice if you want it and need to have it i say buy it if you want a real scotch tho pick up a macallan 18 or a glendronach 21 parliament  after being turned off glenlivet having only tried the lacklustre 12 this 21 was a real surprise night and day difference this is a rich round and smoothly voluptuous dram with satisfying substance  a compelling and most pleasant whisky so much so sat down for a quiet whisky and realised half the bottle had evaporated  every year for mother s day i put a bucket of ice and this glenlivet out in case my two sons decide to quot surprise quot me for twenty years i was sad they never came for a drink with their poor old mother today i say quot great quot it leaves more for me glenlivet 21 is the nectar of the g ds  good but largely disappointing for a 21 comparable to a balvenie 14 or macallan 12  sorry spelt whisky wrong american computer in all my 70 years this is the best whiskey i have ever tasted this is definitely the best scotch i had very smooth with good finish i had party last night after tasting the glen 21 many of wine lovers in the crowd are converting to scotch just had a first bottle of this masterpiece loved every drop of it definitely recommended  i am a old scotch man 96yr i think this is a great birthday present for the grand kids mostly cause i think this is a great single maltsen dogal bell i have a few different brands and this is a very good drink l have one or two glasses a week  i had this at a party with other scotch lovers the after notes are amazing an absolutely beautiful nose and over amazing bottle  i have been lucky enough to have shared 6 bottles of this great whiskey with my friends im not an expert in any way but always savour this special drop and save to buy one everytime one of lifes milestone comes along i splashed on the 25yr old on an overseas trip and have great memories of that but its this 21 i would love to afford every day  last xmas i recieved a bottle of 18 yr old macallan this year it was the glenlivet 21 a side by side comparison was in order the results macallan is very smooth finish medium long with a milder taste very easy to drink for a non scotch taster glenlivet has a more pronounced taste which i prefer the finish is just as long and just as smooth it wasn t the first choice for the non scotch crowd but was for those who abide winner glenlivet by a dram  i usually drink the 18yr old glenlivet but when i was travelling i splashed out on this 21yr old it is worth the extra money thank you for such a nice dram  thank you for such a good scotch i loved every bit of it nice a crisp over ice it was so good w out ice it is just what you need to wake up thank you altho i m not a expert i d say that this is one of the best scotches that i ve had it was smooth and delicious and every drink i would taste a new flavor definatly buying it again but my next purchase will be the 1972
6254.0, great lemons and sweet smoke water brings some liquorice so very very quaffable so glad i got mine for a bargain because it will be finished soooo quickly  but for the price it 39 s not a bad whisky at all it 39 s smokey sorta sweet lots of smoked trout on the nose campfire it 39 s a good whisky but i 39 ve tasted equally good islay at a lower price not dissapointed but you can get better malts for this price age isn 39 t everything so long story short tastes good had better not a rebuy but not dissapointed  price quality is excellent for one 25 years now  i 39 ve been looking forward to try this one really but now that i am drinking it i must say that i expected more my tip only add a splash of water if you have to and drink it slowly the smootheness is nice and the aftertaste is subtly smooth smokey on the palate fruity on the tongue hints of plum and just a spark of vanilla if you 39 re lucky overall a nice whiskey yet not an instant rebuy  delicate and nice tried one of these last summer with the stamp from 2010 rally great whisky expensive well yes but worth all the money lovely like a silk stockings delicate and nice but ultimately not very rich and with a fleeting aftertaste a disappointment to a caol ila lover especially at this price  amazing taste i love it but 12 years is very good too bought a small dram to give it a try and i could only get a burnt rubber taste maybe it was just a bad dram  prova i had one of these in january with the state stamp from 2008 rally great whisky and luxurious looking presentation can t wait to be 25 yo again 
21472.0, pleasant and fruity with a long finish but not sure i detect the sweet toffiness in the above description  nose sweet floral honeyedpalette warm honey lightly toasted bread just a hint finish long lasting more floral notes hints of malt more honey warm alcohol taste goes right down to the stomach i enjoyed it best with just a dash of water  after trying cardhu 12 and gold reserve tried the 15 totally different from the gold reserve and a slight slight improvement from the 12 got sweet chocolate notes great after wood notes with some but not much spice i didn 39 t feel the alcohol so it is smooth easy to drink but for a slight improvement over the price of the 12 i reccommend to try it at a local bar first after quarentine of course  smooth drink with that great warming after feel looking forward to trying cardhu 18 and gold reserve absolute class and any other description would not do it any sense of appreciation what a tipple regi l u t c h m a y a london easy drinking speyside add a tiny drop of water a mouses tear if you like and let it sit for ten minutes notice the difeerence in aroma ten minutes later warm toffee and fruity not complex on the tongue but a great drop never the less a new rival to the dalmore 15 for me in my easy drinking category buy it you wont regret it  love 128148 it it is now my favourite whisky 129347  loved the nose rich crewe br 251 l 233 e with some lovely spices and caramelised apples a little less complexity in the mouth but still plenty there to keep you interested all round a very nice smooth speyside  it is a well balanced flavor elegant smooth scotch beats some cases 18 years bottles absolutely best value for money  i find the 12 year to be smoother haha but i can find more richness and flavours here however it 39 s not the best whiskey at it 39 s priceclass  very nice flavor great bouquet  lovely toffee not lonely tomas sweden  i love the predominant note of toffee there are indeed layers of fruitness raisins mostly a big step up from the standard 12 cheers tomas sweden  this was my first expedition into quot expensive quot whisky wow what a change from the 163 25 bottles that i used to get from the supermarket very smooth it 39 s warming but doesn 39 t burn on the way down toffee notes and long finish just have to decide whether to go to the next price level now this could get expensive  ok the first thing i will admit is i am no accomplished expert on tasting scotch however for what it is worth i have dabbled in balvenie glenkinchie glenlivet johnny walker blue black and platinum and oban this cardhu is my go to sup wonderful  bought a dram to try and this is probably my new favorite easy to sip very smooth and with just a hint of smokiness without being too overpowering lovely  this is very good whisky with long finish it is ideal for autumn evenings  complex warming toffee slight smokiness at first followed by coffee or toffee aftertaste very smooth and very very nice 
75309.0, it 39 s very smooth slightly smoky sweet and bitter i think i can taste the e150 flavour  this is a very enjoyable dram very reminiscent of the old superstition bottling sweet with honey and vanilla some dried fruits and a whisper of smoke not overly complex but very drinkable  terrible excuse for a single malt tasteless flat and sour no complexity no fruit no smoke poorly blended batch from third rate casks what is going on here  big discrepancy between this bottle and the one i had a few months back not to say this is a bad whisky or batch but the difference is like between red and black johnny walker last bottle was 4 5 this 3 5 and totally different yet bought from same shop at same price  love this whisky great value interesting and complex taste easy sipping high quality stuff  a lightly smoked dram that will suit those making the leap from honeyed north scotland whisky and those rather thin speysides not all to a more oily pleasing drink that needs no water or ice room temperature and the nose is lacking but the palate and aftertaste are good  lovely eventually starts off when first opened with an unbalanced strange nose on the palate industrial grease however when it s sat for a couple of weeks after opening it develops into something fantastic there s subtle smoke oak and grains on the nose peppery spice on the palate to start developing to chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee the finish has smoke pepper and maybe chilli despite wondering what i d bought to begin with this turns into something wonderful given a little time to sit after opening  sensational balanced glassful of malt  people buy me this because they know i like whisky its always this i decant it and offer it to guests as i find it boring its the one i drink towards the end of the night when flavour no longer matters i m no connoisseur but i thoroughly enjoy this bottle i m sure there are better out there and i ve read reviews on it being a little raw but frankly there s an honesty in the flavours that i love i ll certainly buy it again  shocked i have been enjoying jura single malts for quite a few years with much enjoyment but after trying this twice the second time to confirm my initial judgement the rest of the bottle will go down the drain too bitter to drink  this is a fantastic all round quot go to quot whisky i always buy when its on offer such an nice easy drinker  quite disappointed harsh and chemical the journey which is cheaper is a much more enjoyable drink  inconsistent between bottles i 39 ve bought two of these now the first bottle was beautifully smooth and flavor the second bottle although still flavourful was very harsh by comparison which i think is reflected across the mixed reviews here if you get a good batch it 39 s great if not then it 39 s a tad disappointing worth picking up when cheap though  fantastic malt but what do you expect from jura smoky but not overwhelming with fruity notes coming through lasts on the tongue excellent balance a joy to enjoy fantastic value  not as pleasant as i d hoped nice enough much better than your standard single malt but nothing ground breaking  another classic from jura smokey with notes of vanilla and fruit long lasting finish very strong all rounder and an absolute steal for under 163 30  a nice balanced all rounder pleasant sweetness with subtle smoke if you fancy an easy going sweeter dram on and evening can t go far wrong at this price no standout notes which can often be a compliment  good balance your first experience is smoke and peppery spice before an onrush of honey and sweetness very easy drinking but value for money 30 quid a bottle opens it up to a fairly crowded and competitive market  i gave this a rather harsh review as i loved origin which this replaces having persisted it 39 s still not origin but it 39 s far nicer than i originally gave it credit gentle smoke creamy vanilla really quite pleasant probably only 3 5 but rated higher to counteract my other score  creamy chocolate raspberry vanilla and spice goes down a treat after a meal jura 39 s 10yo origin was my favourite 39 cheap 39 whiskey it bunched well above its weight i have no idea what jura were thinking with this new direction but this isn 39 t a patch on the origin so harsh and more like a cheap nasty bourbon than the creamy smoothness of the origin such a damned shame  i paid 163 25 discounted from 163 38 i wouldn 39 t buy again even at that price i personally just find it very harsh and not smooth quite a pleasant taste though  i do quite like this fruity sherry coffee ginger spicy all nice flavours and easy to drink quite intense for 40 abv not watery at all like some weaker whiskies  30 quid these days isn 39 t bad for a10 year old but i tried this in a pub for the first time last night maybe cause the bottle was opened for my drink it maybe hadn 39 t had time to oxidise but my first impression was far from good can 39 t recommend at all  amazingly smooth and sweet with what i felt was almost a viscous apple core feel in the mouth not a whisky connoisseur but loved it very enjoyable very smooth a very pleasant change tasting whisky without the bite the only down side was her indoors enjoyed too so had to share very nice well it suits my taste buds so it 39 s a 4 from me surprised at the smokiness  way to much e150 colouring in this whisky and lacks complexity i bought this when it was discounted and wouldnt be happy to pay the full price  pulled up to 3 stars by the fact that at face value it 39 s pretty damn nice this would be worth a good four or more if tasted in isolation but given the whisky this replaces it 39 s lucky to get any stars at all the honey raisin sweetness threaded with woodsmoke is still there and it would take a lot of doing to ruin that but well have you ever made a sauce with molasses or black treacle in it then tasted it and thought quot just a bit more quot then you stir more in but you wish you 39 d left it be although it 39 s now fine it 39 s just darker and richer than you want how it was would have been better a step down from where it was good but quot best ever absolute favourite quot definitely not  what have they done way too dark for an islay theres a still a hint of the old jura taste but now hidden in a sea of dark oak and coffee smells awful but terrific smooth taste top draw got this at tesco for 163 25 and happy for the price nothing overly spectacular but a nice entry level whisky not got the kick of other whiskies but their is a honey taste initially and then a string raisin date taste to it with a hint of caramel a pleasant drink but don t expect it to blow your socks off  whilst not a deep and complex whiskey there is a lot going on and most of what 39 s going on is pretty tasty albeit not particularly well balanced tinned lychees with a hint of honey and some floral almost violet notes on the nose pleasant oily mouthfeel reveals a taste of chocolate raisins i know its plagiarism but it 39 s true mixed with apricots before an aftertaste of chilli white chocolate leaves the tongue and lips a tingling it 39 s a pleasant dram but would i buy it in the face of better balanced competition well i wouldn 39 t rule it out but more often than not i would be looking elsewhere  not all bad but very thin mouth feel and just tastes like is lacking a punch on delivery was a big fan of their superstition so can not understand the change they are clearly charging considerably more for a noticeably inferior product  hurrah now this is much better than the old version smoke fruit and a little caramel light pleasant and very well balanced i 39 m a fan again 
59662.0, macallan fine oak 18 and 17 as well are wonderfully complex and i find myself enjoying their complexity of multiple caskings at first they seem mild compared to the standard sherry oak but they are not heavy sherry whisky so it isn 39 t fair to compare them to 100 sherry caskings but when studied by themselves they are amazing  not as good as i thought it would be nice but not 163 175 nice not in the same league as glenfarclas 25 which is 163 110 at the moment 
11884.0, this is most assuredly a quality whiskey for the price however it was a bit too harsh and woody for me i m no expert at all by the way had to splash some h2o in just to take the edge off much prefer the 12 year which is absolutely sublime got the lustau arriving tomorrow so we ll see who comes out on top  i bought redbreast 15 as my first foray into irish whiskies and i was absolutely floored holy cow this is the best whiskey from any country that i have ever tasted very complex without tiring the palate i tasted delicious vanilla custard and the lightest hint of wood don t bother with yamazaki 12 pick up two bottles of this instead it s expensive but i refuse to daily drink any other whisky now simply sublime  nose apple crumble but not the garbage we typically make this is michelin palate sweet vanilla sponge cake hints of ginger after the spice drops gently back in some wooded sherry adding it steps to the journey  how good this is  an incredible flavour profile happy refined smooth and potent yea yea baby i d move to ireland  this is an absolutely exquisite insanely smooth dram cannot recommend enough don t bother with yamasaki 12 just get this  taken me a while to review this as its a bit of a odd one its overall a bit moreish of the 12 yr old in everything i guess certainly more sophisticated and can take a splash of o2 although leaving to sit for 10 mins has a similar effect on it i think i prefer the 12 overall which saves me money but this is certainly a top class drink struth i was gifted a bottle of 15 and what a gift for scotch single malt fans like myself you 39 ve got to try this as a previous reviewer said its does not last long enough so glad i discovered it by chance suggest you take a chance too  this whiskey ticks all the boxes wonderful nose lovely layers of flavour and great finish probably my top whiskey for the money a good leap from younger whiskies it has a rich tongue coating feel and good depth an absolute classic  my favourite 163 50 163 100 whiskey unfortunately each bottle i buy doesn 39 t seem to last long classic pot stilled whiskey at its absolute finest  this is one of the best whiskies out there a big step up from 12yo redbreast and not that far off the 21yo at less than half the price this is a top dram and at a reasonable price considering its quality  the tasting notes above and other reviews here eloquently describe the character richness and smooth sweet nature of this single pot still whiskey very well expensive but certainly worth it once in a while distinctly different from the 12y i 39 d suggest trying both  redbreast 15 is a curious but pleasing blend of smooth buttery sweetness tasting it for the first time from a bottle given to me as a christmas gift i found it quite stimulating allowing little temptation to indulge in tippling more than one shot over ice oh so nice smooth and gratuitous i will have to hide this one in the deepest rendering of my liquor cabinet this irish is the best i have tasted i think you will agree given the opportunity to indulge  this was beautiful until i noticed the tobacco i 39 ve very happily gone through multiple bottles of this over the years smooth and buttery hint of sweetness but just noticed the tobacco now i can 39 t shake it so faint but gross this was one of my favorites but now not sure i can recommend it anymore  this is one of the great whiskeys of the world and a shining example of the rich and complex flavors the single pot still style can deliver the description is spot on quot rich thick sweet pungent whiskey with loads of flavour and complexity really good stuff quot this is expensive but very much on my list of favorites this is worth traveling to find bottles once opened tend to disappear into blissful enjoyment quite quickly  bloody marvelous serve to any irish whiskey skeptics or scotch bigots  haven 39 t had it in quite some time so i can 39 t give a proper review but it is certainly my favorite irish whiskey i find it 39 s even better than the redbreast 21 and as a single malt fanatic i 39 ve found that most whiskies tend to quot peak quot at 15 years and after begin to take on more oak than anything else this one is viscous and pungent one of my favorite drams and i intend to open a bottle on st patrick 39 s day  this bottle is not going to last a very long time  the most intriguing and enchanting after taste magical sure the 39 little people 39 must be involved beyond the beyond tastier than middleton so  first let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of the 12 yo rb a great buy and usually my choice of drink at a bar but i keep the 15 yo at home that being said i personally feel that the 15 yo and 12 yo shouldn 39 t be so closely compared as i see so many reviewers do on this site and others the 15 is more expensive but offers more complexity and aromas that if allowed to open up properly are a step or two above the 12 yo remember i really love the 12 yo too it 39 s just in a different subset of really good whiskey to me it 39 s like the difference between riding in a corvette z06 and a ferrari they 39 re both world class sports cars one 39 s perceived as a better quot deal quot than the other and you can really have fun in both which you choose to buy is pure preference i prefer ferraris  had this with a single ice cube at the dirty onion in belfast as a session tootled away each sip was a roller coaster hot honey fruit butterscotch citrus leather peat vanilla and heat again but the heat of an embrace not a burn this is lovely stuff  its my favorite irish out there and i cannot understand why anyone would want to drink anything else it 39 s great beginning to end you can count on that  butterscotch or is it butterirish for sure i love the simplicity and the mouthfeel of this medium heavy viscosity but light on alcohol punch and oak just a little sweet for my taste i prefer the sourness of say the glen grant 16 which has an otherwise identical mouthfeel and finish and is a bit cheaper  nice but in the same price range as redbreast 12 year cask strength which is much much better too sweet for me a lot of honey going on i much prefer the 12 yr rb  this is the absolute best whiskey that i have ever sipped i i tried this on my 75th birthday while on a visit to ireland had this at flannagans and the owner michael recommended it one good thing about drinking it over thereis that it was cheap only 7 euros a shot or 10 us this is much smoother than scotch or aged straight tequila or even some of the best bourbons i don 39 t think i can goback once i have tried the best whiskey in the world  none better period  i 39 m normally an islay big peat fan but if i have to name a favorite non peated this may be it compared to e g aberlour and glenlivet 18 39 s which are also among my favorites there 39 s less almost none of what i call the quot cardboard quot taste it 39 s just rich smooth honey y and terrific originally i was going to say that it 39 s a bit lighter than typical scotch whiskies but sipping one now i 39 m not so sure i 39 d say even that the thick honey is really coming through aberlour and tomatin feel a tad bit more pork fattier but this one is just really really nice  if you 39 ve had redbreast 12 don 39 t be fooled redbreast 15 is not even in the same game redbreast 15 is my favorite whiskey i 39 ve ever had and i 39 ve had a few 750 bottles taste is so smooth and the finish leaves no residual negative tastes i know this is now in limited supply so if you see it buy it  smooth vanilla port honey up front oak and fruit finish  smooth rich and perfectly balanced i never thought irish whiskey could be so good but what with bushmills 16 yo and 1608 i have been proven profoundly wrong  would give this full marks as it s complexity in flavour is complemented fully in it s smoothness on the palette rich and warm with such sweet undertones left me looking forward to every sip 
19608.0, soft and warm very enjoyable super quality whiskey one on my favourites  a lovely creamy dram this i first tried it at a distillery tasting years ago and was impressed along with the 21 and 25 which is nectar anyway this has to me honey cream a little smooth spices maybe caramel vanilla etc and a little lemon too incredibly smooth and finish is longish but milder than most for this money i 39 d say the tomatin 18 is better struth my favourite scotch bought a bottle at the distillery amazing  does it get any better than this awesome iv tried the 10 12 15 and generally i do like glengoyne for bang for buck your getting a decent dram so i came into this excited it 39 s very creamy very smooth and inviting everything seems to mix well cream apples honey maybe a little brown sugar good little finish aswell not short but does leave a nice taste afterwards all in all impressed with this one going to give it a 4 star  well balanced subtle hints of apple and spices on the nose so smooth a truly enjoyable dream that doesn t muck about just sit back close your eyes and reflect on the day at this price point would gladly buy 2 at a time  wow had this as my birthday present have enjoyed every sip of it beautiful on nose palate and after taste my new favourite in 18 year range also price is excellent d phenomenal but not a typical sherry bomb as the sherry is balanced with the whisky rather than running amok all over it very very good and with a lot of substance good spices in there good heavy mouthfeel wonderful tastes on the palate but with some definite surprises i 39 ve tried numerous 18 year olds this might be the pick of them it 39 s a coin flip between this an glendronach allardyce  a wonderful whisky my pick of all the glengoyne whiskies currently in production i still have some 17 year old too to my mind the 17 is a better dram but if you are not a fan off peat smoke in your whisky then this is the whisky for you  like drinking smooth caramel butterscotch silk so glad i went with this instead of the 18 yo glenfiddich an absolute pleasure from nose to sip to finish so deep in flavour my new favourite  spice cake honey and rich dark fruit with a long velvet finish superb for an 18yo at this price point  good nose and pleasurable finish it is a joy sipping this liquid together with friends under a starry night  fantastic whiskey round and mild can easily replace your favorite xo cognac or zacapa rum in front of the flames an late evening  flew through a smaller bottle of this had to buy a 70cl as it was just so good salty sweet and smooth tastes like a lot of older stuff inside superb depth of flavour  it was a big shock at the first sipping giving the fact that this whisky is quite chip it feels like the big expensive guys out there when you get to taste that one highly reccomended very nice whisky with big flavours of coffee marzipan toffee and walnut amazing balance and fullness of flavours one of best 18 yr olds out there great stuff 128513  awesome whisky a hint of chocolate raisins green apples caramel and vanilla  i bought a bottle to my cousin for his 50th anniversary i had a few other choices but after tasting this one i was sure he 39 d like it too and he did very warm long taste wonderful balance highly recommended  great scotch value for money better then any other glen 18 available at market give it a try very smooth liked it better than glenfiddich which was my favorite fir many years  i have been in glengoyne distillery with my girlfriend on the 14th of june in 2017 we joined the wee tasting tour we had tasted 12 year old and 18 year old glengoyne both of them lacks of complexity before getting there we drank higland park 18 glendronach 18 glenfarclas 15 in edinburgh all of them are better than glengoyne 18 if i hadn 39 t tasted glengoyne 18 at the distellery i would definitely buy a bottle after tasting it i just bought a miniature of glengoyne 15 i admit batch variation can effect the reviews i don 39 t think a bad batch can be served at the distellery i know every whisky cannoisseur and renowned whisky sites gives higher points to this whisky but i 39 m not sure at all as well as my girlfriend  my summary says it all  a delight for the drinkers loved it  complex and tasty picking up some banana on the nose and great spice on the palate a great dram to sit down and experience  so smooth and tasty that even my wife likes it  probably the best whisky i have tasted to date the smoothness on the palate allows for that time to taste the flavours while still enjoying the warm of a good dram  a really really good sherried malt wonderful balance and so smooth highly recommended  modern in both presentation and content this was a great sherried scotch good finish clean seemed a bit thin let it sit a long time almost no water if any good price for an 18 most are over priced especially when there are 14 15 year bottles as good or better  i like the nose vanilla and brown sugar i found it rather spicy i miss a certain sweetness a solid whisky the pricetag is reasonable for its age  i m a speyside man mostly but having tried the 10 15 and now the 18 y o i m impressed with this whisky and as i live in glasgow i hope to visit this distillery very soon everybody should try this  having been a longtime fan of the 17 year old i was hesitant i nosed hints of dried apple cinnamon orange peel vanilla and candied pecans wonderful mouth and immediately reminded me of christmas and the smell of figs carmel toffee and biscuits were the warming finish the distillery was great and i would recommend it to anybody in the vicinity of glasgow  a light friend fabulous and gentle softly spiced hints of apricot and vanilla notes of caramel candied finish  i have tried this at the distillery twice and also at home it has an deep intense flavour i would recommend pouring into the glass and leaving to sit for a good 30 45 mins as the flavour really opens up one of my favourite drams from one of the best distilleries in scotland  i first drank it in the ablanach a fine whisky bar in edinborough i like it because it has the slightly sweetish aftertaste i love in the too expensive for me balvenie 21 year old good stuff at a good price 
2094.0, this was one of the first single malts i purchased when i began my scotch journey it was decent but i quickly moved on to others i preferred it really lacked the richness of something like aberfeldy i wouldn 39 t pass it up if it was offered but have no plans to purchase again  i enjoyed this whisky i like trying different whiskies and its one of the better i 39 ve tried of late for around the same price however i still prefer glenfiddich and chivas regal  this is a surprisingly good whisky such an easy drinker a great introduction to glengoyne  if this wasn 39 t alcoholic i could drink it all day fruity creamy with a longish almost aquatic finish it has something of tobermory 10 in it like brussel sprouts but in this case very well done it very moreish highly recommend  amazing dense butterscotch on the nose grass nougat and candied fruit on the palate with hay and minerality finish has a seaweed note sounds bad but it s really pleasant this is eminently delicious  bought this and the 12 yo after visiting the distillery the 10 seems a bit immature to me but still an excellent malt citrus honeyed malt and spice actually quite hot the 12 is splendid but on opening has a cabbage note just like the 18 but it soon disappears 12 yo is 5 5 as is the 18 both smoother and richer than the 10 an amazing distillery  a good whiskey to enjoy with friends and family love the taste and it 39 s very smooth and aromatic one of the finest in this range i must say 1 time every one should try it  a good solid whisky light sweet and easy on the pallet not the best in the glengoyne range but for the price it s an excellent whisky which always goes down well with guests you won t be disappointed not even close to any single malt nor it s price has an awful nose to make matters worse really worse glengoyne 10 has a rubber cork instead of natural cork and this rubber cork imparts a nasty rubber smell the moment you open it once you get that in your nose it is impossible to enjoy rest of the pour horrible to say the least surprised none have noticed this or may be as its poor overall anyway no one bothered will try to decant the remaining and see if that improves it like the sweetish milder taste though but any day for a dram like this will stick to glenmorangie 10 nose tinned sweets by the quart sour drops palate hints to burnt butterscotch but instead desways into near sherry wooded notes nicely done after it declines from the same and its palate experience gives it permission nicely done  chose to open this bottle as highly recommend by a friend who lives just up the hill from the distillery i have have to say i wasn t impressed to start with but it s growing on me i get the red apple now but no toffee in my opinion just the overwhelming initial impression of citrus wouldn t say smooth either but i do enjoy the high almost acidic aftertaste now which does last forever  great whisky sweet light and complex at the same time  il keep this short a good solid dram for the price tag this is a great everyday drinker good balanced flavour nice finish and great price tag will be buying a bottle you can 39 t get much a much better highland single malt for this price the natural colour is beautiful a full bodied highland with a smooth finish excellent scotch  review in portuguesehttps youtu be kva6y1_t1cq juicy red apples juicy white grapes juicy fresh cut grass on a juicy spring day young juicy malt like pastry dough sweet toffee and brown sugar custard clean and elegant juicy glengoyne wilt thou marry me  super disappointed in this dram how anyone calls this smooth is beyond me the finish is extremely harsh and lasts forever glenmorangie 10 is infinitely better and cheaper  fantastic dram i enjoyed glengoyne 10yo immensely the fruity aroma and creamy sip did not prepare me for the lovely sharp tang which popped up in the woody aftertaste i may need to develop my taste for toffee as i didn 39 t get it immediately but that wouldn 39 t stop me from entertaining other whiskey lovers with this worthy distillation  perfect every day drink if your looking for super bold and complex it may not give you what you want though this whiskey is almost perfect for whay it is absolutely no off flavors and great texture one of my favorites  a sublime balance of sherry casks and distillery fresh fruity apples character a very charming young malt and a personal favourite decanting might be an idea for this one let it breathe for a few days after opening 4 5 stars  allen milnsbridge all whiskies are subjective all i could say about this one is it 39 s ok by no means a bad one a little over rated and certainly over priced  very impressed i had never heard of this one i drink glenfidich but this whiskey is very good one can smell the apples and toffee immediately very good and comes from the macallan line  aromatic and not overly ripe red and yellow apples fresh fruity succulent sherry creamy toffee little bit of bite to the oak i found myself giggling with the first glass it 39 s got your average calvados beat in the apples department i can tell you that collapsed on the second day leaving dried prunes yeast and a hint of cigarette butts in place of orchard and oloroso went through figs and apricots on its way back up to its initial freshness with my bottle that took four days nose fills out further with a drop of water but at 40 abv the palate i feel can 39 t take it i drink this neat high quality whisky  god yes but let it breathe for a few days big change in taste and smell i strongly suspect the couple negative reviews are from people who tasted it from a just opened bottle many whiskies need to breathe and this one even more so for whatever reason there really is a stale ashtray aroma from a just opened bottle but that will go away completely  quite nice would not have taken it for a 10 year had i not seen the bottle make no mistake this is a lowland in everything but name so expect something very smooth and very floral  la relacion precio calidad es muy buena siendo un whisky muy suave balanceado y facil de tomar 100 recomendado thank you kati so smooth  my favourite great and smooth impressive for a ten year old  great purchased a bottle of 10yr malt on our visit to distillery 2014 expensive but great not harsh great nose and good on the back of the throat will soon be ordering another  really enjoy this fine smooth whisky good starting mark for the glengoyne range which carries a age  very much like loch lomond neighboring distillery in that it 39 s certainly missing the mark somewhere perhaps this is simply the preferred 39 recipe 39 in that area i 39 m not particularly a fan of while smooth it comes across as one noted and lacking in depth and interest the nose is confusing at first it 39 s stale and musty then big floral notes and green apples come thru the palate is slightly tart and dry with a lingering finish of more green apple tartness and attic dust reminiscent of an inexpensive blend smooth and easy drinking but no depth of flavor to make it a memorable experience for this price and more character i 39 d look at a tobermory 10 instead  i love the smoothness which reminds me a bit of irish whiskey my first taste came from a bottle that had been opened sometime ago opening mine clearly revealed that it has to breathe for a while before the actual aromas and flavours come about now i really enjoy its sweetness definitely a excellent dram glengoyne has a special character to it not your typical sherried whisky had the 12yo cask strength and it displayed the same kind of leather rubber notes in the nose eventually as you get used to it toffee and spices and dark fruits come through i like the fact that it 39 s not a young whisky that 39 s just quot good quot or quot bad quot which is unusual for a young whisky  on first opening its quite uninteresting and as previous reviewers have commented there 39 s a definite smell of stale cigarettes most bizarre the second visitation was much more pleasant with green apple and toffee sweetness not my favourite but drinkable nonetheless  clearly a whiskey which divides opinion other comments seem harsh considering the distilleries intention to produce seething not peaty lovely caramel amp vanilla flavour with a bit of fruit drinkable  a nice tasting malt bought it in november 2014 163 27 42 but by december it costs 163 32 33 fuel and transport cost have come down so why does the cost rise so dramatically  wonderful scottish malt having lived at the shores of loch lomond a few years back this scotch actually reminded me of the smells and quot flavours quot of the area a fine tipple for its price range dry and crisp with smokey undertones very pleasant indeed  really not up to par i feel very let down after reading the comments on here and choosing to believe the better reviews oddly enough this tipple improves slightly after decanting for a few days however after reading the comment about cigarette stubs i have to agree i did note the unpleasant aroma for the several days after opening  ignore the daft remarks below this is a lovely wee dram tried recently against many other whiskies and found it to be soft and sweet vanilla with wood notes just lovely  i would like my money back please first whiff hit me and was deeply unpleasant smells reminiscent of an old ashtray filled with day old at least cigarette butts second whiff revealed strong hints of uncoated multivitamin tablets the over sized kind that make you gag and have a horrendous after taste i struggle to find anything worth while about this whisky and i would feel guilty giving it away there are far far better drinks out there for the money terrible is the first word that sprung to mind when i brought the glass up to my nose and it is the last word that hangs in my mind thinking about this abomination  as an irish drinker for many years i ve started to re discover scotch later in life this one i liked floral and light not for the smoke amp peat monsters but no burn at the finish not overly oakey it just my thing i ll probably invest in something else from this distiller  i ve just bought a bottle of glengoyne will post notes later but i must admit disgust when persons compare heavily peated whiskey to unpeated as though they should have the same nose and tasting notes i often find they complement one another in a tasting session  light grassy floral aromas bitter oak and green apple taste  can t say i m a fan didn t excite me didn t excite my nose or palate i was looking for unique defining characteristics i don t why i just was and i didn t find them maybe it had something to do with the fact that prior to this bottle i had just finished a clynelish 14yr and belvenie 17yr peated cask now they were something else i guess in comparison i felt a little let down  d oh as a fan of aberlour and similar sweeter whiskies i was recommended to try this and it has quickly become a favourite very smooth see above  went to the distillery some years ago and that was when i fell in love with single malt whiskey this 10 year old is very smooth and full of complex flavours without peaty or heavy smoke tainting more depth and texture than the 12 year old highland park i also have glad i got the glengoyne 10 absolute pleasure in a glass with a dash of water  kept me so busy wondering about the flavours i forgot about the tumultuous world around me amazing flavours that come out of just one sip  this stuff is dangerously drinkable proceed with caution if you like aberlour or macallan this will be one you will enjoy  so smooth and subtly sweet
104467.0, this is a rare miss from ardbeg i ve never before had something from ardbeg that i didn t love but this is not a good dram the smoke is there but almost nothing else is except for a touch of burnt plastic and sulphur  harsh yet has a remarkably short finish a decent attempt but it doesn t hit the spot for the price there s better offerings as others have alluded too the 10 is infinitely better for just a few 163 more  best 5 year old single malt that i ve knowingly had the 10 is far better but that s not to take anything away from this fantastic dram the price point of around 163 32 on sale is about right  wonderful dram punches way above it 39 s the youth of the whiskey just feels like a little pepper on the palate whereas the nose palate and finish are as good if not better than the 10 my new go to single malt from ardbeg  hmmm personally think the 10 is far superior is very rough and you get a lot of raw alcohol notes from it which i m not a fan of try it if your a fan of ardbeg but don t expect something of the same standard as then 10 wowsers the youth sting hits you first up and i don 39 t particularly like that bite i 39 ve found in smokehead big peat and kilchoman presentations but under that the smoke waft you get the sweetness notes coming through i 39 ve spent an entire afternoon on two generous drams and the experience with both is after a while the sweetness with layered smoke is just divine i went off months off reviews online on yt etc and got myself 3 bottles and just from these two drams i can tell you it was a great buy and one that i will enjoy for some time to come  for a 5 year old this is impressive so interesting on the nose smoky sweet and fresh on the palate the saltiness comes to the fore with plenty of peaty smokiness together with a sweetness that balances the whole thing well the finish is lingering smoky and zesty very impressive indeed  despite it being a mere 5 yo this islay malt delivers smoky peat with nice flavor much like many of ardbeg 39 s nas whiskys however noticeably not as full bodied as something with more age on it its youth is evident but depending on the personal taste of the consumer not necessarily inferior for me it 39 s very very good but not quite excellent i wouldn 39 t turn it down as it is an enjoyable islay malt from ardbeg but would rather be offered a dram of the 10  tried this at my friends place and i was pleasantly surprised it 39 s a really nice peated scotch i love ardbeg 39 s 10 year old and was very excited to try this latest younger edition of their offerings if you enjoy a heavily peated smoky islay malt like i do then this is a must dram the color is a light golden straw with just a hint of haze on the nose is a powerful waft of smoke and sea spray with a touch of creamy butterscotch and toffee sweetness the wonderful peat smoke of islay explodes on the palate with tarry rope and more sea spray similar to their 10 year old but even more raw and intense the sweetness of butterscotch and salted caramel comes through as well which balances out the intense smokiness very nicely the finish is extremely long and lingers long after tasting the whole experience is like enjoying a bonfire on the beach after a day out at sea well done ardbeg for this beastie of a dram  when i open this it just tatsed raw but having sat open for a month the complexity developed very well quite a punch but with a beautiful fruity slighty lighty oaky but very peaty flavour for the money not at all bad  as peated whiskeys age they tend to lose the overwhelming peat flavour and gain complexity for me the 10 year old ardbeg has always been a brilliant trade off between the two opposing forces in the case of wee beastie whilst the nose and mouthfeel of the five year old is quite similar to its older stablemate the iodine is unsurprisingly much sharper and more pronounced and the finish is shorter but horses for courses this one isn 39 t going for the last word in sophistication and those who are in search of a great in your face peat experience should find it quite satisfying and at a great price point  not a fan of this at all sounded right up my street and was excited to try it but found it very disappointing  this is an exceptional young whisky lovely peaty smoky nose oily mouthfeel and sweet at the end i am impressed leave it in the glass for a bit and it gets more interesting its good  normally a 10 year old fan but this may relegate my 2nd choice bowmore 12 year old to 3rd place very enjoyable  back in 2004 ardbeg bottled a 1998 distilled whisky under the 39 very young 39 label as that spirit aged two other bottlings came along but it is the original very young bottling that is still very fondly remembered that bottling came in at a hefty 58 3 and certainly punched its weight the only question is why have ardbeg made us wait 16 years to release the 5 yo wee beastie like it 39 s predecessor wee beastie is a wonderful dram naturally there is smoke and peat and all that other good stuff that you expect from an ardbeg but with it comes a blast of sweetness that is an absolute delight i 39 m fortunate in being able to compare very young and wee beastie as i have a few drams left of the former and i have to say that in my opinion ardbeg have done it again and produced a dram of startling precocity this is an outstanding whisky  viable partner to the 10yo and at around 163 10 cheaper a real bargain take your time with it  really intresting whisky i can 39 t belive i am the first one that gives a review on this it tastes like a completly different whisky then the ardbeg 10 but in a good way still very smoky but if i didn 39 t know it was ardbeg i would have guessed some nas lagavulin 
75578.0, the second release of this whisky is must darker in colour and completely different in taste to the first batch personally i 39 d go for the first batch every time which is now unfortunately impossible to find its lighter more hints of butterscotch and vanilla with chocolate a real winner  keep coming back to this time and time again unbelievable for the money vanilla and toffee and a little kick at the end but nothing unfriendly  not a sherry monster but heavily influenced the sherry finish and wood shine deep toffee and fruit apples and banana and a hint of allspice at the back of your nose it 39 s a glass crawler too clings beautifully to the sides of the glencairn smooth and spicy in the mouth the rich butter toffee comes to the fore mixed with a strong ginger tingle stewed fruit pie and caramel alongside the little pepper catch good stuff the finish is medium but very warming the dark burnt toffee remains with a little hint of dark coffee a fantastic single malt for the money and a crowd pleaser  toffee banana salted caramel amp creme br 251 l 233 e a lovely enveloping mouthfeel like it s hugging your tongue long lingering finish will definitely buy again  great complexity toffee banana creme br 251 l 233 e amp salted caramel lovely starchy mouthfeel will definitely buy again  very different to any whisky i have drank complex and intriguing mellow and deep rooted with an earthy sweetness  fantastic single malt this is great stuff with so much flavor and aroma fruit dessert ripe fruit young fruit sweet and a salty dessert it s great stuff for the reprice  absolutely loved this and look forward to more of the same from the genius that is billy walker  on my 2nd bottle of this beautiful stuff  like previous review did not think that much of this on first tasting but after time in the bottle has become one of my favourite 12 yr olds and had to go back and get another bottle once it was dusted ripe baked banana and pineapple with nicely balance oak influence which balances better over time as the bottle goes down very tasty and enjoyable  absolutely gorgeous rich sumptious amp smooth as hell for 48 would never have expected this outcome from sherry virgin oak combo but it really works amp tastes unique there are some frankly ludricrous unjust reviews of this whisky posted here amp while i understand we are all entitled to our opinions sometimes these can be misleading fortunately we 39 d already had this amp a few other of the new glenallachie bottlings yet to expereience a bad one but i 39 m particularly fond of this because it 39 s lovely amp excellent value keep up the gooood work billy amp co some of us can tell you guys love yer whisky  can t remember a whisky that benefited from open bottle time more than this one really didn t care for this whisky upon first opening especially the finish but subsequent tastings were really quite delicious  i just made a review that was after drinking it with ice at letting the non chilled filter effect of ice take course was disappointed smooth but oily however i just tried it neat and it was much better so my review of two and a half stars has to be given another star at least if drunk neat  kind of disappointed non chilled filtered 46 was expecting greater things smooth for it 39 s age taste oily then again what do you expect for that price  i just finished this bottle it warrants nothing more than ok i will not buy it again  one word explains this bottling stunning the flavours of butterscotch vanilla chocolate shine through in this dram far too good to share  oak oak oak a previous reviewer mentioned that it is best stuck with chivas to make blends and i concur that you get tons of vanilla and oak and those two notes are likely to overwhelm the rest of the experience at 46 it does not take too much water to make it stale and the ginger spice mentioned is in fact the alcohol burn it will do justice if strathisla 12 was vatted with it  i had a similar experience of that of a previous reviewer i tried glenalachie for the first time in the fall of 2019 after viewing one of ralphy 39 s reviews recommending it that first bottle was very fruity however i tried it again on march 2020 and it had a very strong wood oak flavor that was off putting i don 39 t think i will buy it again  went to a tasting event and tried a bunch of glenallachie 39 s i thought this one was pretty good bold flavours big impact but a peppery oaky note on the finish which i found overwhelmed the palate slightly it 39 s a good whisky worth trying but not a 5 whisky for me  huge fan of the new developing glenallachie especially this 12yo which is fantastic value for money  i hate that virgin oak taste why they use it and no ralphy this is not the whisky of the year imho this distillery should remain in the chivas beholding really nothing special a blend stuff and nothing more  stunning ticks all the boxes  enjoyed all neat unpretentious laid back genuine these buzzwords goes together with this whisky for what its for nose hay vanilla honey notes appear with water banana under ripe honeydew hint of herbal tea dried plum in the back ground reminds me of tomintoul palate young with vigor fresh quite oily oaky bitternote gingerfinish oaky coffee bean medium length good value for money but not for people who like their drams sweet imo  an easy enough drinking sherried whisky but not a patch on the glendronach 12 which is a cheaper and a far superior whisky my advice is to go for the glendronach 12 unless you find the glenallachie with at least 163 10 off its price tag as my title suggests when i first opened my bottle and tried this whisky i was not impressed it seemed very ordinary and at 163 41 for a 12yo i felt a bit cheated however as i worked my way down the bottle over a period of weeks i came to appreciate that this is a very good dram and well worth taking the time with it as the previous reviewer says 46 and ncf and no added colour always makes for a better whisky  butterscotch mazipan raisins mocha honey the good bourbon oloroso and px cask maturation really makes for a complex exotic and rewarding dram bottled at 46 non chillfiltered and non coloured as a whisky connoisseur i am sold this is such a great scotch it reminds me of the quality of 2012 glendronach 12 when billy walker had rebooted that distillery he sold it to buy this one glenallachie now he 39 s the boss and you can really taste that quality he brought to glendronach in the glenallachie substance this is beautiful scotch and honest 
1925.0, a wonderfully rich and balanced blend potent honey on the palate and on the eye have never found another 18 year old at this price so its value proposition simply cannot be beaten  its a very nice whisky my old next door neighbour he gave me a bottle of this for my 30th but my mum drank it 128514  firstly everyone appreciates different things and to the nay sayers i am not a bot i love a single malt but bought this blend after seeing that it had won some awards and was in the sale n 8 10 incredible p 7 10f 6 10 very smooth but lacks complexity overall 7 10 and i m a very harsh marker for comparison in my opinion it beats the jw 18 but falls below the glenlivet 18x my wife bought me a bottle of chivas regal 18 year old for christmas it is outstanding the smothest and best whiskey i have ever tasted just drink on it 39 s own doesn 39 t need ice or water  purchased birthday with my limited experience drinking scotch this had become one of my favorites for me m very silky and smooth very little smoke to my liking very impressed a winner 127468 127463 129347 128077  hi chivas regal 18 year old is my favourite tipple it is a great blend and goes down well  this is good but it doesn 39 t impress so much it 39 s just average maybe there are better choices at the same price r  i m not impresses by this blend i like the chivas 12 a lot but you can do much better in that price range of the 18 the palette is rather thin and the finish is rather quick and bland for a bit cheaper you can get jw green label 15 which is a vastly superb product imo  bought the sample bottle five years ago and put it in the pantry finally opened it up tonight clean ice and glass sipping slowly exactly as described above i 39 m a novice but it is warm buttery complex ingredient variations in my opinion and super smooth  nose vanilla orange grassy oaky hint of smoke overly balanced not a strong nose palate oaky little spicy hint of marmalade in the background finish marmalade and strong dark chocolate very oaky add a few drops of water and it only becomes more smoky and woody all subtle notes disappear expected way more quite thin and boring not much to it absolutely beautifull but dangerous i opened a bottle to test it and soon found the bottom of the bottle easy to drink very smooth 10 10 big disappointment for 60 quid you can get a far better drink i should have known better buying a blend and anything at a mere 40  i think i need a bottle  this is a good scotch to drink the nose is full and the taste is rich with flavor go get a bottle and put a smile on your face  oaky rich the winner  great introduction to high end scotch doesn 39 t over power with leather smokiness very smooth light med bodied very enjoyable even for non scotch drinkers highly recommended to all grownup non fireball drinkers much much better than their 12 as that 39 s the only over chives i 39 ve had i cant get down more than one dram of jw black or chivas 12 i could easily down 2 or 12 d of these gonna go buy another bottle  chivas alongside jw are the main players in the blended terrain whiskies that you could get anywhere in the world this shouldn 39 t degrade them though as someone could think that these drams are another average commercial product speaking specifically for chivas regal 18 yo there are not too many other whiskies that can beat that especially at that price although i am a big whisky fan i cannot class myself amongst these whisky connoisseurs that can distinguish aroma and different flavours although i will keep it really simple saying that this is probably the smoothest whisky you can get with a really balanced taste unique aroma and amazing colour the 12 yo is good but once you jump on the 18 yo there is no way back highly recommended for special occasion and for every day as well slainte  great scotch unique spicy finish  rich full of flavor best chivas so far blueblooded all the way two thumbs up  i could never understand why people drank whisky neat until i tried this malt the orange and smoke overtones were very evident in this palatable single malt  excellent value for the money drank along side mcallan 15 21 and 25 my blended scotch is usually johnny walker i was impressed with quality and price  disappointed would drink anything from compass box in this price range over this sipped spice tree side by side and this couldn 39 t stand next to it glad i tried it always good to know where your tastes lie at the end of the day i most appreciate the single malts  this is great stuff and has more depth of flavours that the 12 year old as a premium whisky it should be bottled at a higher strength than 40 be careful adding too much water as it tastes best at near full strength lovely orange chocolate and toffee flavours with sherry notes and spice it is only beaten by balantine 39 s 17 that is in my opinion the ultimate premium blended scotch  very excellent and smooth  the peat is there the vanilla is there the green apple is there the spice is there and it s totally balanced its all there just buy it just enjoy it it s worth it  so good i have my bottle for 7 months and still can 39 t find a celebration good enough to open it i 39 m enjoying it right now i 39 m new to scotch i 39 ve tried the 12 y thought i would try the 18 i like the 18 the spice and what you call wood from the barrel stand out to me very nice  12 is good but 18 is much better  smooth i love the texture and aroma of this whisky good its a excelent drink super excellent whisky and amazing how many more complex flavours you get with a decent blend compared to single malt you can see why it 39 s won so many awards  great best in class exquisite taste smooth and excellent in all respects  try this buy a bottle of chivas 18 buy a bottle of johnny walker blue try them both go back to the store and buy another bottle i bet you 39 ll grab the chivas for the price it beats the best  great  amazing how the 5 reviews are all barely a few words my favourite is quot ever been the best blended whisky of all time quot i guess the chivas brothers never went to school my favourite words are 39 planted review 39  nicely balanced easy drinking approachable in every way this would be a good whisky to introduce a non whisky drinkers to scotch  absolutely beautiful the best there is in my opinion  ever been the best blended whisky of all time  my second bottle and the sweetest way to relax when i want to drift off smooth lingering finish i really like after a few icy cold flem cutters beforehand  below average at best perhaps the worst 18 y o i have ever tasted nose is promising excellent grain spicy oak amp some sherry influence first sip amp it all changes with milk chocolate orange spoiled by an unpleasant bitter sour back note finish is short and returns to the sherry tones ok its 18 y o hence the rounded depth which is good but the bitterness is why i wont buy again its simply not a good blend the artificial tango suntal colour is offputting and why a miserley 40 when 46 would have helped this shine  firstly let me say i like this a lot i think there is some quite old sherried malt in there secondly i drink a wide range of whiskies of all styles from all parts of the world i often end up with bottles of the less expensive malt whiskies with maybe 100mls left and i don 39 t really want to drink it so i have adopted a tactic of pouring the last remnants of these bottles into a decanter to mix them together this creates a blended malt of mysterious provenance and it 39 s fun to pour it for friends and listen to them trying to guess what it is thirdly the contents of that decanter are very similar to the chivas 18 smooth balanced mildly sherried a satisfying dram easy to drink fourthly what that tells me is that the chivas 18 is about as good as a random mix of 12 year old malts with the odd touch of a 39 bunadh thrown in compared to other mainstream blended whiskies this is excellent but at 163 10 a bottle more than say the glenlivet n 224 durra oloroso cask strength 163 7 more than arran malt 14 yrs nah i still like it though  great blend with great nose and taste leaves the 12yo far behind  the best very nice dram  good nailed it i can 39 t remember the last time i a dram of chivas but i saw this at a great price picked it up and a week later the 18 year is almost gone i loved this so much i gave it to my son as a christmas gift way to go chivas  i am a single malt man but this is absolutely a must try very smooth and goes down really well chivas 18 has got me  5 stars taste started with this scotch and love it one of the best and i ve tasted more expensive very smooth with just the tight amount of burn  for a bleneded scotch superb i agree with the comment made below i would much rather have an excellent blended scotch than a quot that was ok quot single malt i have this at home and chivas is one of my quot go to quot scotch kris i 39 m a huge fan of chivas 25 simply one of the best blends in the world and hugely satisfying but i had never tried the 18 year old which is available at about a quarter of the price it 39 s a lovely drink thick creamy full of taste with a slightly spicy quite dry finish it is smooth as expected but not in the same league as the 25 happy i 39 ve tried it and will enjoy this bottle but i 39 ll stick to the 25 from now on  title says it all chivas 18 is one of the best scotch you can get at about 18 usd period  i 39 m a single malt snob it affects my rating if this were a single malt that was quot tastes exactly like new air jordans quot i may give it as high as a 9 given it 39 s just a blend i think quot really all they can do is make it taste like a pair of new sneaks quot but also think it 39 s decently drinkable and not too expensive so give it a 7 though it 39 s not all that cheap either likely won 39 t buy again regardless too much else in the world  superb perfect balance between orange and wood call me names but i take spirit with water or ice allowed to melt a little or as much as it takes for me to feel some of what these professionals are expressing in their tasting notes this one is rich and spicy and the first blend i 39 ve really enjoyed which is to say i 39 m going now to pour another  i have always been a makers mark drinker started with jack but this is simply amazing anyone who mixes this with anything but an ice cube should be skinned alive i can only imagine what the 25 year old tastes like this is just plane superb  this wins head to head against single malts like aberlour 12 great woody with some moderate alcoholic burn which i suprisingly like here glenfiddich 12 average fruity malt glenfidich solera vat 15 probably the best nose but not delivering on the palate as it is on the nose but still a great one glenlivet 12 good stuff but i kind of got bored after 5 bottles or so the triple 2 vs 1 fight against chivas 12 my everyday drink but i think it is losing its touch lately or maybe it was just a rotten batch in a small 0 05 l bottle and jwb 12 better then chivas 12 lately almost a little to sweet but hides that sweetness with some smokiness was also won super easy win against cognacs martell martell vsop courvoisier hennessy and remy martin vsop was also super easy a side note just that maybe hennessy came close but still very far away i like remy martin also but just a little to much alcoholic burn to my taste which i enjoy sometimes but not always the only battle that was really a though one to call a winner was a head to head to laphroaig 10 which is a love hate kinda a thing but a true masterpiece to my nose and taste and i was going back and forth smokiness and superstrong taste from laphroaig 10 was trying to prevail but after i was drink water sniffing coffee and finally deciding at the end that chivas 18 is way better chivas 18 gold signature is really like liquid gold sweet super smooth just the right amount of smokiness and sweetness and when you quot wash quot your mouth with it it leaves that rich long lasting finish mmmmm  the best of chivas high standard very smooth and classy  although i prefer single malts this is the best blended whisky with jw green go for it smooth  soy amante de los single malt pero este blended es increible top shelf cracks me up with the whole quot dried fruit and dark chocolate quot comments if you want that go get a cherry ripe if you want a good scotch this is it  ms dung said it is good one of my favourites very smooth and in my opinion best served with one ice cube  not much on the nose palate very smooth with a woody malty peppery smoky finish slight fruitiness very smooth spicy flavour wasn t expecting much from this whisky but i was very pleasantly surprised  great  gentle on the palate with a sophisticated after taste  very the soooooooonnn  excellent stuff try it straight  un profumo eccellente e un gusto incredibile has a faint smoky flavour near the end through the dark chocolate and dried fruits fantastic  better than 12yo but at 18 years could be smoother for a little more you could have glenlivet 18 im not a whisky drinker but youve got me 18 years old the king of whisky zanesha gaidam chera inghad gerune lovely good for the money it s definitely worth the extra 20 to get the fantastic 21 year aged chivas royal salute  packed with flavour dried fruit and bitter chocolate worth every penny  lovely lovely
75578.0, the second release of this whisky is must darker in colour and completely different in taste to the first batch personally i 39 d go for the first batch every time which is now unfortunately impossible to find its lighter more hints of butterscotch and vanilla with chocolate a real winner  keep coming back to this time and time again unbelievable for the money vanilla and toffee and a little kick at the end but nothing unfriendly  not a sherry monster but heavily influenced the sherry finish and wood shine deep toffee and fruit apples and banana and a hint of allspice at the back of your nose it 39 s a glass crawler too clings beautifully to the sides of the glencairn smooth and spicy in the mouth the rich butter toffee comes to the fore mixed with a strong ginger tingle stewed fruit pie and caramel alongside the little pepper catch good stuff the finish is medium but very warming the dark burnt toffee remains with a little hint of dark coffee a fantastic single malt for the money and a crowd pleaser  toffee banana salted caramel amp creme br 251 l 233 e a lovely enveloping mouthfeel like it s hugging your tongue long lingering finish will definitely buy again  great complexity toffee banana creme br 251 l 233 e amp salted caramel lovely starchy mouthfeel will definitely buy again  very different to any whisky i have drank complex and intriguing mellow and deep rooted with an earthy sweetness  fantastic single malt this is great stuff with so much flavor and aroma fruit dessert ripe fruit young fruit sweet and a salty dessert it s great stuff for the reprice  absolutely loved this and look forward to more of the same from the genius that is billy walker  on my 2nd bottle of this beautiful stuff  like previous review did not think that much of this on first tasting but after time in the bottle has become one of my favourite 12 yr olds and had to go back and get another bottle once it was dusted ripe baked banana and pineapple with nicely balance oak influence which balances better over time as the bottle goes down very tasty and enjoyable  absolutely gorgeous rich sumptious amp smooth as hell for 48 would never have expected this outcome from sherry virgin oak combo but it really works amp tastes unique there are some frankly ludricrous unjust reviews of this whisky posted here amp while i understand we are all entitled to our opinions sometimes these can be misleading fortunately we 39 d already had this amp a few other of the new glenallachie bottlings yet to expereience a bad one but i 39 m particularly fond of this because it 39 s lovely amp excellent value keep up the gooood work billy amp co some of us can tell you guys love yer whisky  can t remember a whisky that benefited from open bottle time more than this one really didn t care for this whisky upon first opening especially the finish but subsequent tastings were really quite delicious  i just made a review that was after drinking it with ice at letting the non chilled filter effect of ice take course was disappointed smooth but oily however i just tried it neat and it was much better so my review of two and a half stars has to be given another star at least if drunk neat  kind of disappointed non chilled filtered 46 was expecting greater things smooth for it 39 s age taste oily then again what do you expect for that price  i just finished this bottle it warrants nothing more than ok i will not buy it again  one word explains this bottling stunning the flavours of butterscotch vanilla chocolate shine through in this dram far too good to share  oak oak oak a previous reviewer mentioned that it is best stuck with chivas to make blends and i concur that you get tons of vanilla and oak and those two notes are likely to overwhelm the rest of the experience at 46 it does not take too much water to make it stale and the ginger spice mentioned is in fact the alcohol burn it will do justice if strathisla 12 was vatted with it  i had a similar experience of that of a previous reviewer i tried glenalachie for the first time in the fall of 2019 after viewing one of ralphy 39 s reviews recommending it that first bottle was very fruity however i tried it again on march 2020 and it had a very strong wood oak flavor that was off putting i don 39 t think i will buy it again  went to a tasting event and tried a bunch of glenallachie 39 s i thought this one was pretty good bold flavours big impact but a peppery oaky note on the finish which i found overwhelmed the palate slightly it 39 s a good whisky worth trying but not a 5 whisky for me  huge fan of the new developing glenallachie especially this 12yo which is fantastic value for money  i hate that virgin oak taste why they use it and no ralphy this is not the whisky of the year imho this distillery should remain in the chivas beholding really nothing special a blend stuff and nothing more  stunning ticks all the boxes  enjoyed all neat unpretentious laid back genuine these buzzwords goes together with this whisky for what its for nose hay vanilla honey notes appear with water banana under ripe honeydew hint of herbal tea dried plum in the back ground reminds me of tomintoul palate young with vigor fresh quite oily oaky bitternote gingerfinish oaky coffee bean medium length good value for money but not for people who like their drams sweet imo  an easy enough drinking sherried whisky but not a patch on the glendronach 12 which is a cheaper and a far superior whisky my advice is to go for the glendronach 12 unless you find the glenallachie with at least 163 10 off its price tag as my title suggests when i first opened my bottle and tried this whisky i was not impressed it seemed very ordinary and at 163 41 for a 12yo i felt a bit cheated however as i worked my way down the bottle over a period of weeks i came to appreciate that this is a very good dram and well worth taking the time with it as the previous reviewer says 46 and ncf and no added colour always makes for a better whisky  butterscotch mazipan raisins mocha honey the good bourbon oloroso and px cask maturation really makes for a complex exotic and rewarding dram bottled at 46 non chillfiltered and non coloured as a whisky connoisseur i am sold this is such a great scotch it reminds me of the quality of 2012 glendronach 12 when billy walker had rebooted that distillery he sold it to buy this one glenallachie now he 39 s the boss and you can really taste that quality he brought to glendronach in the glenallachie substance this is beautiful scotch and honest 
62173.0, amazing whiskey and amazing service was very concerned this being my first expensive whiskey brought on the internet that it would get damaged in shipping but no it was packed to a very high standard will shop here again what a piece of joy big rich punchy and so much going on if you buy one glen moray this year make it this one the 12yo expression in this range is decent value for money but i 39 d probably take the ancnoc 12yo which is cheaper in a similar style and every bit as good the 18yo was slightly disappointing after this and didn 39 t really advance the expression you can see my debate with another user on that subject in the tasing notes of the 18yo as if that 39 s interesting this is the one to take in this range def would buy have bought in fact on multiple occasions which is proof ian nose is pleasant the arrival is nice but that it not much development and a clingy astringent finish that 39 s not altogether pleasant would expect more complexity and development at this age and price point  glen moray 10 chardonnay casks was my favorite whisky but the glen moray 15 y o leaving nothing to be desired here is my original review and i am still enjoying this floral shop of a whisky in the winter it is a reminder of spring glen moray 15 y o speyside single malt scottish whisky 7 14 18there was a pleasant floral note from the bottle when i first opened it left the bottle open to breathe for 30 minutes40 abv a marriage of whisky aged in oloroso sherry casks and ex bourbon american oak casks color a pale yellow with a nice ring and legs running variously nose a grape note with a background of floral the grape note has a rich sensepalette floral notes on arrival with a hint of fruit underneath the mouthfeel is light yet coating it seems to have a syrupy texture as it sits in my tongue yet the floral notes are light and pleasantfinish lightly spicy yet retaining a light sweetness there is a light syrupy sense on my tongue but not overly sweet there is a floral note lingering in my mouth as time passes with 1 drop of poland spring water nose a grape note with floral underpinnings similar to my neat experience in every way palette the mouthfeel is lighter yet there is a sweeter note pepper rises as i hold it in my mouth swirling it creates a combination of light pleasant candy sweetness and light spice finish very spicy and drying some alcohol burn on the tip of my tongue overall drying sense with 2 drops of poland spring waternose floral note is predominant still with a rich sensepalette light syrupy sweetness pleasant a light pepper rises as i swirl it with a drying sense as well the sweet note remains in the background finish spicy and very drying again that tingle on my tongue tip if coloring is used in this expression it is used sparingly because the color is of a yellow similar to strained apple cider the mouthfeel here is very coating for a 40 abv whisky neat as usual i enjoy this whisky neat the most all the notes are at their strongest there is a very nice experience of fruit and floral notes even though grape notes are evident on arrival the floral notes rise as it sits in my mouth the syrupy note is more about coating and is pleasantly sweet not overbearing it becomes sweeter with water yet never crosses the line into overbearing a very pleasant glass give it a try  smoooooothe  this should have been 5 stars  this is a superb whisky from my favourite distillery i have long been a fan of glen moray whiskies the 10 year old chardonnay cask being my all time dram please bring it back this however is a worthy replacement absolutely stunning right the way through recommended 
45577.0, wonderful complex smooth and easy to drink outstanding value  the whisky that got me back into whisky on a trip to poland the aberfeldy 16 year old is a phenomenal whisky and a permanent fixture in my whisky cabinet  silk smooth lots of oak with pleasant fruit and spice  delicious creamy and smooth dark fruits spicy yet smooth oak and just the right amount of sweetness  simple enjoyable and absurdly smooth  simply not shy but not overwhelming an easy drinker for newbs or folks that do not care for the deeper drams simple smooth scotch nice for your non whisky drinking friends its a impressive oak flavor the 16 years really made an impact and the spirit are perfectly oak tasting but there 39 s nothing else buy a dram so you have tasted it but that 39 s it it 39 s good quality but so boring great oak but nothing more 
False,
